the role of f layer tilts in detection of auroral
    ionization back scatter echoes received at stanford california
    from the auroral e region are shown to be propagated by way of
    a tilted f layer the rays returned from the e region scattering
    source proceed to the f layer without intermediate earth
    reflection the f layer is so tilted that the rays are then
    returned to the receiver a tilted mirror model of the f layer
    demonstrates the effect this explanation is shown to be more
    probable than that in which the echoes are presumed to be
    returned from auroral ionization at great heights although this
    latter explanation may occasionally be true
