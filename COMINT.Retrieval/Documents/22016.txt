monotonic transient response restrictions are derived
    which must be placed on the poles and zeros of the system
    function of a linear system with lumped constants in order that
    the response of the system to a step function drive shall be
    monotonic system functions having up to three s zeros are
    considered a method of dealing with systems containing more
    than three zeros is explained
