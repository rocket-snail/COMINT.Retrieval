public libraries as a compulsory provision by local
    authorities. an increasing number of people believe that the
    position of local authority cultural services must be clarified
    in the 1980s. the library service is a part of local culture
    that cannot be overlooked and so it is essential for each
    library to cooperate with other libraries, cultural
    organisations and local government administrators. a decision
    is needed as to whether local authorities are not only entitled
    but also obliged to administer public libraries. the concept of
    a national library law should be renounced in favour of a
    concept whereby local authorities impose on themselves the
    obligation to provide public libraries. local communities
    should draw up their own library plans and provide the money;
    each state should then provide financial assistance for library
    work outside these areas.
