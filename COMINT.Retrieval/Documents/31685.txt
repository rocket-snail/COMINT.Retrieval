auger peaks in the energy spectra of secondary electrons
    from various materials measurements on c be al ni cu ba pt and
    oxides of some of these are reported a description is given of
    the highly sensitive apparatus used characteristic peak due to
    auger electrons emitted as a result of absorption of a valence
    electron by an excited x ray level were observed for all these
    materials the structure exhibited by the peaks is related to
    the energy distribution of electrons in the valence band and
    complements that observed in soft x ray emission excitation of
    auger peaks by low velocity electron beams provides a method of
    investigating surfaces
