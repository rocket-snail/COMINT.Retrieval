comb filters for pulsed radar use the use of comb filters
    for improving signal noise ratio is discussed in relation to
    the variation of the frequency spectrum of a radar signal with
    the number of pulses in the received trains the relative merits
    of the simple uniform type the rectangular sin type and the
    north type sin matched filters are compared the small gain in
    sensitivity obtained with type does not warrant the greater
    complexity of its design
