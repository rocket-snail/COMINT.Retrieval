the generation and application of rectangular pulses a
    survey of various known techniques covering both relaxation
    oscillators and monostable circuits a delay line pulse
    generator a free running multivibrator and a cathode coupled
    monostable multivibrator are discussed in detail the
    suitability of a valve for switching applications can be
    estimated on the basis of a figure of merit given by the ratio
    between the mutual conductance and the total interelectrode and
    stray capacitance transition times are about for circuits using
    high double triodes or pentodes and of the order of for
    circuits with low valves
