replacing the printed word: a complete literary system.
    under guiding ideas that are not technical, but literary,
    project xanadu is implementing a system for the storage and
    retrieval of linked and windowing text. the 'document', the
    project's fundamental unit, may have windows to any other
    documents. the evolving corpus is continually expandable
    without fundamental change. new links and windows may
    continually add new access paths to older material. fast
    proprietary algorithms render the extreme data fragmentation
    tolerable in the planned 'back-end' service facility.
