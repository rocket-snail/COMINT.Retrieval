a range of and transductors for service use a survey of
    common transductor types is made and details are given together
    with particular applications of input type transductors with n
    mumetal or permalloy cores for supply voltages of and rms and
    power type units with hcr or permalloy f coe cores for supply
    voltages of and rms all are of the automatic self excitation
    type
