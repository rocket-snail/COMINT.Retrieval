a quality assurance process in health sciences libraries.
    a goal of libraries is to assure the improvement of library
    services. many use standards as a method of assuring the
    quality of services, but standards have often failed through a
    lack of individual commitment to those standards and to the
    methodology used in establishing them. many segments of the
    health care field have adopted the concept of quality assurance
    and are applying it to the service and care they provide. the
    process has the potential to raise or assure quality of
    service. it involves' selection of a subject for review;
    developing measurable criteria; ratifying the criteria;
    evaluating existing services using the criteria; identifying
    and analysing problems; developing and implementing solutions;
    and reevaluating services. 2 pilot quality assurance studies
    conducted in the midwest health science library network in june
    78 are described. plans are underway to use this process on a
    regional basis.
