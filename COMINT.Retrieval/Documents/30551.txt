d layer ionospheric echoes at macquarie island echoes
    from d layer heights have been recorded at the australian
    station on macquarie island geomagnetic latitude i since
    operation started in echoes are of similar type to those
    observed in tropical latitudes and occur on most days of the
    year on a few occasions each month echoes persist throughout
    the night the highest frequency at which echoes are received
    usually increases from below at first appearance within an hour
    after ground sunrise to above at noon decreasing to below at
    disappearance during the hour before sunset strong d echoes
    remain on occasions when other daytime echoes are absent due to
    high absorption the effect may be peculiar to island
    observatories
