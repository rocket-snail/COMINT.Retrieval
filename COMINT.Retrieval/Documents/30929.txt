aspects of data communication and computer networks.
    outlines the present state of computer communications and
    future trends. the configuration of data communications is
    changing from a star-like to mesh-like layout in which many
    computers and terminals are connected through a digital data
    network. public data networks providing either packet- or
    circuit-switching are in service. network architectures
    permitting connection of computers and terminals of different
    makes and models are commercially available and are in the
    process of being standardised internationally. packet-switching
    technology has been extended to encompass communications
    satellites, radio, and local hoops.
