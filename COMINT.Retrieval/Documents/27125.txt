gravitational influence of jupiter on some geophysical
    phenomena consideration of astronomical observations from
    ancient times onwards has indicated apparent variations in
    astronomical time attention is drawn particularly to a
    variation having a period of years this is also the period
    taken by the sun the earth and jupiter to return to the same
    alignment and relative distance it is suggested that the
    combined gravitational action of the sun and jupiter causes
    tidal motion in the earths crust the apparent variation of
    astronomical time corresponding to a real displacement of the
    meridian
