nonlinear condensers the properties and applications of
    high permittivity materials containing are discussed with
    particular reference to the dependence of the dielectric
    constant on temperature and on the voltage applied applications
    of capacitance with the dc bias voltage in a modulator and in a
    capacitor type amplifier are described
