multiple coincidence magnetic storage systems in existing
    magnetic matrix storage systems a given location is selected by
    applying to two intersecting wires a current equivalent to one
    half of the selecting field this situation is generalized so
    that any core is selected by energizing wires each with a
    current equivalent to of the selecting field the advantages
    gained are in the correspondingly smaller fields applied to the
    nonselected cores or alternatively in the faster switching
    times obtainable by applying a total field greater than the
    coercive force to the selected core specifically a storage
    matrix is illustrated in which the cores are toroids etched
    from a continuous sheet of magnetic material
