the drift of an ionized layer in the presence of the
    geomagnetic field the efficiency of air winds in causing
    ionization drift decreases with atmospheric pressure thus in
    the f region electric fields may be the main cause of drift in
    the region electric fields may contribute equally with air
    winds in the d region air winds would be the main cause the
    effect of winds and fields is causing drifting of cylindrical
    irregularities in each region is given
