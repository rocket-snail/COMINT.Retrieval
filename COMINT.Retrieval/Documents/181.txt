networks. revised version of a paper presented to a
    meeting on regional library cooperation in deventer, 19 nov 81.
    in the netherlands cooperation amongst libraries of all types
    has come under close examination as a result of the inclusion
    of public library services in the proposed public services act.
    the concept of library networks dates from the early 1900s when
    the need for libraries to share their resources was recognised.
    the most effective library networks are those networks which
    operate their services on a financial basis. in addition, the
    coordination of acquisition policies, cataloguing services and
    interlibrary lending amongst members of a library network
    requires the most up-to-date telecommunication and computer
    equipment. within each network a central library should be
    designated to act as a clearing-house for the transfer of
    information.
