pascal data base file description and indexing rules in
    chemistry, biology and medicine. this report on the
    multidisciplinary pascal data base describes the files and the
    indexing rules for chemistry, biology, and medicine. pascal
    deals with all aspects of chemistry within 2 subfiles whose
    combined yearly growth is about 100,000 references. indexing
    for chemistry uses 2 lexicons of controlled terms describing
    phenomena, processing, properties, methods, equipment, names of
    chemical reactions, and substructures or families of chemical
    compounds. a similar set of 2 vocabularies is used for biology
    and medicine. the form of the descriptors and the indexing is
    similar to that used throughout pascal in that indexing is
    accomplished to the most specific term within a hierarchical
    structure. specific indexing rules are provided in detail for
    subdivisions within the 3 disciplines. report not available
