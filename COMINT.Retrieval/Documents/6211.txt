art library associations worldwide' their history and
    future. (paper presented to the art libraries section at the
    ifla conference, leipzig, aug 81.) the worldwide compass of the
    visual arts and their parallel documentation brings with it the
    necessity for a worldwide network of information retrieval,
    communication and organisation between art libraries. this, and
    the personal commitment to material and readers, gives art
    librarianship its distinction-one which, within art library
    organisations and within ifla, has been continuously developed
    and shared over the years. a particular duty of the art
    librarian now must be to help preserve the local and national
    qualities of art and life within the framework of the
    international scene.
