nonlinear and controllable inductances made of thin and
    magnetic films the inductance considered which may be used for
    parametric amplification takes the form of a thin ferromagnetic
    film in a magnetizing coil the effect of film premagnetization
    on the inductance value is calculated experimental results
    obtained for a coaxial oscillator system are compared with
    theory
