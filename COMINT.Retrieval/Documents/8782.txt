solar outbursts at mm wavelength report of results
    obtained at the naval research laboratory washington dc with an
    aerial having an aperture of and correlation with observations
    at wavelength and with the occurrence of solar flares typical
    records are reproduced the mm bursts are in general of smaller
    amplitude and of much shorter duration than the bursts observed
    on greater wavelengths
