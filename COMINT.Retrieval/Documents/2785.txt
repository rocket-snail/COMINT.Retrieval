large amplitude hydromagnetic waves above the ionosphere
    the hydromagnetic wave velocity is calculated as a function of
    altitude there are two regions where the wave velocity changes
    very rapidly with altitude and it is concluded that
    hydromagnetic waves above the ionosphere have an amplitude
    greater than the geomagnetic fluctuations they produce at the
    surface of the earth see also of october
