high characteristic impedance distributed constant delay
    lines for fractional microsecond pulses the delay lines
    described are pile wound with wire of gauge about turns in on
    polystyrene rods previously coated with silver paint slotted
    lengthwise at intervals and then insulated with teflon tape
    prior to winding a typical line in length and in diameter has a
    characteristic impedance of a delay of and an attenuation of
    the order of db pulse rise and fall times are about response
    curves for pulses of and duration are give characteristics of
    and lines are tabulated
