the applicability of active filters to the measurements
    of the frequency spectra of pulses the use in frequency
    analysers of active filters comprising amplifiers with double t
    type rc networks results in higher q values at low frequencies
    than is possible with stagger tuned lc circuits the error
    assessment given by seeger and stablein of is also applicable
    to this type of circuit
