the effects of anisometric amplitude patterns in the

    drift by determination of time shifts between fading curves of
    ionospherically reflected waves received at three spaced points
    is discussed and the errors involved in assuming that the
    amplitude pattern on the ground is statistically isometric ar

    the errors are not generally systematic
