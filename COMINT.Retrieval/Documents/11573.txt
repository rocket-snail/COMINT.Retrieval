influence of ratio on magnetic properties of toroidal
    cores the optimum design of cores for magnetic amplifiers is
    discussed a theoretical result is obtained assuming a
    parallelogram shaped hysteresis loop and an experimental
    investigation is reported the dependence of the optimum tatio
    on the magnetic properties of the core material is
    indicated
