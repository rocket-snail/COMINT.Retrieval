the distribution of temperature along a thin rod
    electrically heated in vacuo part theoretical an integral
    expression derived for the temperature distribution can be
    expanded as a convergent power series for evaluation two
    regions are defined region a in the middle of the rod and
    region b the portions outside a in the a region temperature
    distribution is parabolic in the b region it is practically the
    same as in the corresponding end region of an infinitely long
    rod an analytical expression is obtained for the temperat ure
    at the centre of a rod as a function of its length for a
