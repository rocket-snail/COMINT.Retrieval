effect of component tolerances in low frequency selective
    amplifiers some experimental results results obtained
    previously by analysis of may have been verified experimentally
    using the operational amplifiers of the analogue computer of
    january trailing edge of pulse in cathode follower eith
    capacitive load the decay time of a rectangular pulse at the
    output of a cathode follower can be shortened by connecting a
    triode in parallel with the cathode resistor and capacitor and
    controlling the triode grid voltage coupling from the anode of
    the cathode follower tetrode valve the circuit constants are
    such that the triode impedance decreases momentarily at the end
    of each pulse
