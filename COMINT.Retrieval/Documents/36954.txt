evaluation of the online search process. the study
    evaluated on-line searching performed on the national library
    of medicine system to identify implications for training and
    continuing education. searchers were selected with formal and
    informal training, from 3 different types of organisation, and
    with differing levels of experience. it was found that most
    searchers have mastered the basics of searching, and that
    performance was unaffected by source of training, experience,
    organisational, or even subject educational background. the
    most consistent source of difference in performance was the
    difficulty of the search itself. report not available from
