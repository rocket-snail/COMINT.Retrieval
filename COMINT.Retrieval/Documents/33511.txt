on transformations of linear active networks with
    applications at ultra high frequencies a relation similar to
    the star delta transformation is developed for linear circuits
    including valves formulae are derived for triode circuits under
    the results are extended to tetrodes and pentodes the method is
    useful for analysing the operation of uhf triodes and for
    determining amplifier admittances and gain
