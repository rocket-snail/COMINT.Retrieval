the galvanomagnetic amplifier discussion of theoretical
    and practical aspects of an amplifier whose operation depends
    on the magnetic control of electrical resistance gauss effect
    such an arrangement is less noisy than magnetic or dielectric
    amplifiers at low temperature among metals bismuth exhibits the
    greatest sensitivity to this effect by using an appropriate
    material such as insb the principle can also be applied to
    amplifiers for ust at room temperature the theoretically
    possible gain is db at and db at corresponding values which
    have bee obtained with experimental units are about and
