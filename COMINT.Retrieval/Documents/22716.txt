a ferromagnetic scaling circuit each incoming pulse
    triggers the discharge of a capacitor through the primary coil
    on an iron wire core the maximum voltage of the pulse induced
    in the secondary depends on the core magnetization and thus on
    the number of incoming pulses on reaching a preselected level a
    thyratron is fired and operates a mechanical counter the core
    being restored to its initial state of magnetization scales of
    up to are stable in operation design details and theory are
    discussed
