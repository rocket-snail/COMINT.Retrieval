diffraction by an irregular screen of limited extent
    information that may be derived about the screen by
    measurements of the diffraction pattern at different distances
    is considered close to the screen the pattern gives information
    about the small scale structure at greater distances it is
    related to the overall extent of the screen measurements of the
    angular diameter of stars ionospheric irregularities and meteor
    trails are discussed
