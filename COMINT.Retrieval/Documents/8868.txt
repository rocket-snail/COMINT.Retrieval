a fire in the debate about the new library bill.
    discusses the library bill proposed by the danish christian
    peoples' party, a minority party whose proposal has no chance
    of becoming law, but might yet influence the ruling social
    democrats' proposal. the c.p.p. supports the library
    commission's minority report and prefers that public libraries
    are administered by the ministry of cultural affairs, while
    research, educational and school libraries come under the
    ministry of education. but unlike the minority report, it
    suggests that no non-book materials and cultural activities
    should receive state support, and that it should be up to the
    individual authority whether to charge for these or finance
    them out of the local rates. exempted from this proposal should
    be lending of audio-visual materials to the disabled. it
    supports the independence of the local authority and its
    decisive influence on book selection. a block grant system of
    financing would also aid local independence.
