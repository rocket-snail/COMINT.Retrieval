description of the change over process in multivibrators
    the dynamic processes occurring in multivibrators are described
    using a graphical method a bistable circuit is considered as
    example and a system of curves representing all possible
    internal processes is derived on the basis of differential
    equations for the characteristic time functions of this circuit
    the influence of the duration and amplitude of the triggering
    pulse on transition time is determined
