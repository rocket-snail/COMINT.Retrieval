online microfilm recorders at los alamos national
    laboratory. the los alamos computing division has developed a
    satellite graphics output station (pages). this station accepts
    user requests for output through a large computer network (the
    icn). the system translates a standard metafile into a
    device-specific format and efficiently generates the requested
    output. at the same time, pages provides some graphics
    processing, previously provided by the large
    supercomputers.
