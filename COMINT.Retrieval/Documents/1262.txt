the effect of inductance on fine transfer between
    platinum contacts an investigation was made with pt contacts in
    a circuit breaking currents of the order of the circuit
    inductance was varied from to measurements of the volume
    transferred and examination of the surface structure indicate
    that there are two types of transfer true bridge transfer
    independent of inductance and short arc transfer dependent on
    the inductance
