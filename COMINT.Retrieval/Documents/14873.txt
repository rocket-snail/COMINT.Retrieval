polar magnetic storms and geomagnetic bays appendix a
    theory of field an current system deduced from geomagnetic
    observations is compared with a system calculated on the dynamo
    theory taking anisotropic conductivity of the ionosphere into
    account agreement is fairly good conductivity considerations
    suggest that the s current system is located at a height below
    km
