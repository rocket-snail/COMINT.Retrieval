stability of a grounded grid amplifier the general
    conditions are investigated for the self excitation of uhf
    grounded grid amplifiers the precise formula and an approximate
    one for the frequency and the condition for self excitation are
    derived the dependence of the stability of the amplifier on
    circuit constants is considered the results are shown
    graphically
