a study of spread f ionospheric echoes at night at
    brisbane part range spreading from an examination of the
    variation of the amount of range spreading produced by sweeping
    the gain of a fixed frequency ionospheric recorder it is
    possible to gauge the degree of roughness of ionospheric layers
    the effective roughness is a function of the separation of
    transmitter and receiver being less the greater the distance
    between them the intensity of z ray echoes recorded in brisbane
    is consistent with elliss theory part of
