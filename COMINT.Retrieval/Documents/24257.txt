piezoelectricity ferroelectricity and crystal structure
    by visualizing polar crystals as a network of permanent dipole
    moments the piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of
    dielectrics may be deduced from considerations of molecular
    symmetry this approach is used to clarify the relation between
    the sphalerite cubic and wurtzite hexagonal structures the
    ferroelectric feedback effect in aspects of domain formation
    and the interrelation between ferro electricity and
    piezoelectricity
