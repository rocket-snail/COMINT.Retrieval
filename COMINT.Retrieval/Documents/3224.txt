perceptions by educators and administrators of the
    ranking of library school programs. a study was undertaken to
    determine professional perception of highest-quality library
    education programmes. the survey sought to determine perception
    rankings of excellence in 4 categories' quality of master's
    programme, quality of doctoral programme for the preparation of
    educators, quality of doctoral programme for the preparation of
    administrators, and contribution to the profession by the
    faculty as a whole. results are compared with those of earlier,
    smaller sample studies, and suggestions for further research to
    examine the common characteristics of schools generally
    perceived as being of high quality are advanced. suggests that
    an examination of these qualities in highly perceived schools
    can lead to a meaningful upgrading of present evaluative
    standards.
