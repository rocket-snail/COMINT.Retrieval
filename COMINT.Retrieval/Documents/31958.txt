palantype machine shorthand in the electronic office.
    reviews the development of a microprocessor-based speech
    transcription system for the deaf. the equipment converts
    palantype machine shorthand into english simultaneously, and
    displays the text on a visual display for the deaf person(s) to
    read. experience gained from trials with deaf business
    executives and at meetings attended by the deaf indicates that
    the system also has applications in the electronic office, and
    in verbatim reporting. these specific applications are
    discussed in detail and comparions are made with conventional
    qwerty keyboard input word processing systems, and with
    stenograph machine shorthand transcription systems developed
    for verbatim reporting in the usa.
