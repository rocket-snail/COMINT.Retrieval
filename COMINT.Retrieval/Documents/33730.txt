the absorption of short radio waves in the d e and f
    regions of the ionosphere values of noon absorption at slough
    have been analysed the electron collision frequencies for the e
    and f regions have been calculated and the variations of d
    region absorption with sunspot number examined the significance
    of the results is discussed
