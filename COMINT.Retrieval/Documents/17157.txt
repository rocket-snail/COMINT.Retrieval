fact retrieval for the 1980s. reviews prevailing
    methodologies of fact retrieval in science and technology and
    makes projections for the decade to come' numeric data bases
    are shown to overtake in size and number the large
    bibliographic collections. this is expected to lead toward more
    sophisticated, interactive data analysis techniques with
    graphical display options. the availability of low-cost
    intelligent computer terminals, micro- and minicomputers, is
    shown to make aggregation and post-processing of retrieved
    information from different sources readily possible. this
    capability may come into conflict with legal constraints and is
    bound to affect the traditional marketing of information. it
    will lead to the extraction of higher forms of intelligence
    from text and data. the user community is seen to shift from
    expert information specialists, who act now as middlemen, to
    the end-users of information. this less experienced user
    community will challenge the ingenuity of system designers for
    self-guiding, adaptive, and yet more sophisticated man-machine
    interfaces. the merging of wide-band digital communication
    networks with computer technologies will make it possible to
    interconnect computers, information centres, word processors,
    and other peripherals, worldwide.
