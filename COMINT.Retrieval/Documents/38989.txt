charge localization on the surface of oxide coated
    cathodes anomalous results obtained while using the kelvin
    method of determining contact potential differences are
    investigated very high contact potential differences which
    occur only after the passage of a discharge are attributed to
    both positive ions and electrons which remain on the oxide
    surface for long periods depending on the conductivity of the
    oxide
