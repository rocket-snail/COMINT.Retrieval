gain bandwidth and noise characteristics of the variable
    parameter amplifier increased gain is achieved by raising the
    of the idling resonant circuit or the amount of variation in
    the variable coupling reactance the bandwidth is inversely
    proportional to and to the voltage gain and directly
    proportional to the ratio of idling resonance frequency to
    amplifying frequency very low noise figures should be attained
    by artificially cooling the idling resonant circuit the use of
    the parametric principle as applied to frequency conversion is
    discussed
