the impact of basic research in the social sciences: the
    case of education. recent evaluations of the condition and
    funding of educational research in the usa assumes that basic
    research in the social sciences is a crucial factor in
    increasing understanding of and ultimately improving the
    practice of education. past tests of this assumption, however,
    have generally relied upon argument by example or anecdote. in
    this study, citation patterns in education literature are
    analysed to test the corollary proposition that basic research
    in the social sciences has had a substantial impact on
    education literature. empirical data collected on citation
    patterns in the education literature are found to be largely
    consistent with this proposition.
