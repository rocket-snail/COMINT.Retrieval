a model for and discussion of multi-interpreter systems a
    multi-interpreter system is a system in which programs execute
    by virtue of being interpreted by other programs, which
    themselves may either be interpreted (i.e. nested interpreters)
    or run directly on the host machine. the model reveals the
    anatomy of interpreters and how these differ from procedures,
    and exhibits links to protection domains and multiprocessor
    architectures. may, 1979 manthey, m.j. interpreters,
