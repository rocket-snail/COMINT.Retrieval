computerisation of the current national bibliography. a
    scheme for the computerisation of the current national
    bibliography in bulgaria has been in progress since 1978 and
    all major scientific and central regional libraries are
    participating in the implementation of the scheme. 8 series are
    planned, including a bibliography of contemporary bulgarian
    literature, and bibliographies of publications issued by
    various government agencies, dissertations, gramophone records,
    and bulgarian periodicals and articles in daily papers. there
    will also be a bibliography of foreign literature on bulgaria,
    together with 1 of bulgarian bibliographies. the frequency of
    publication will range from 1 week, as in the case of catalogue
    cards, through bi-weekly, monthly and quarterly bulletins to
    annual indexes or even cumulative indexes published once every
    few years. the introduction of an appropriate system, including
    minicomputers and videotermini, must be accompanied by the
    introduction of updated national standards on bibliographic
    description, compiled in accordance with the international
    standards, isbd(m) and isbd(s).
