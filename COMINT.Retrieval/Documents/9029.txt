dormant exchanges supported by a system of tokens; a
    suggestion. the term 'dormant exchange' describes an exchange
    system in which 1 library needs and obtains an item at a given
    time from another library but not vice versa. an exchange is
    still made, however, but on a credit system so that the other
    library can request desired material at a later date when the
    need arises, thus eliminating wasteful exchanges. the operation
    could be greatly simplified by the introduction of an
    internationally valid exchange token enabling a recipient
    library to pay for exchange material and a providing library to
    receive credit for what is supplied. it is conceded that
    valuation of tokens could be problematic.
