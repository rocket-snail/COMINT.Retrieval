ionosphere review evidence indicates that the sunspot
    minimum had occurred before the end of the latest sunspot cycle
    exhibited the asymmetry characteristic of cycles with high
    maximum the increasing phase lasted months and the decreasing
    phase about months smoothed sunspot number and critical
    frequency curves show close correlation the increase of muf at
    sunspot maximum is greatest for winter day and least for winter
    night frequencies over appear to have been usable for long
    distance communication during four winters around the sunspot
