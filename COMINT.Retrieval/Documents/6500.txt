the written word and the document' contradictory and
    complementary dialectics. translation from the original french.
    using a methodological framework derived from recent french
    research in bibliology and documentology, the dialectics of the
    written word and the document are analysed sequentially, by
    comparing and contrasting the properties of each in relation to
    their essential characteristics; how they function within their
    respective communication circuits; marxist sociological theory;
    and the historical perspective. from this structural analysis
    of the 2 entities a scientific synthesis is effected delimiting
    the relationship between bibliology and documentology, and the
    applications of this theory in the teaching field examined. the
    analytical model employed, and its method of construction, is
    advanced as a working hypothesis for further criticism,
    research, and modification.
