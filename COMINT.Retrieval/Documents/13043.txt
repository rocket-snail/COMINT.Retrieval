better education in immigrant matters for librarians is
    wanted. traditional library activities for established user
    groups are still the norm in swedish libraries, and immigrant
    services are carried out as humanitarian aid with consequent
    low status. if demand for immigrant literature were treated
    like that for cook books or stamp catalogues a less emotional
    attitude would be achieved. libraries must help immigrants to
    retain their mother tongue as well as to learn swedish. there
    are governmental guidelines on stocking of immigrant literature
    and channels of supply are available, but coordination of
    acquisition and cataloguing is needed. more contact with
    immigrant organisations and better education of librarians are
    necessary. what has already been done is largely due to the
    work of the swedish library association's working party on
    immigrant and minority questions.
