retrospective bibliographic searching in spanish history.
    a paper presented at a madrid conference in 1981 to demonstrate
    the spanish institute of information and documentation in the
    social sciences and humanities (isoc) approach to retrospective
    searching when the literature of the subject is mainly in
    spanish. details are given of the specific subject selected,
    and its suitability as a sample topic discussed, in relation to
    general difficulties for the searcher and applicability of
    techniques employed to the humanities field in general. results
    obtained using 4 data bases and 2 spanish indexes are presented
    and analysed in terms of overlap, date of publication, country
    of origin, and type of periodical. in conclusion a comparison
    is made showing the advantages of automated over manual
    searching. a profile of the typical isoc user is presented, and
    finally recommendations are made concerning user training,
    pricing of search services, and automation programmes.
