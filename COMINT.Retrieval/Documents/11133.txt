new upper bounds for selection the worst-case minimum
    number of comparisons complexity vi(n) of the i-th selection
    problem is considered. a new upper bound for vi(n) improves the
    bound given by the standard hadian-sobel algorithm by a
    generalization of the kirkpatrick-hadian-sobel algorithm, and
    extends kirkpatrick's method to a much wider range of
    application. this generalization compares favorably with a
    recent algorithm by hyafil. september, 1976 yap, c. k.
