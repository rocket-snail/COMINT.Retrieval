a dielectric approach to impurity conduction the problem
    of impurity conduction in valence crystals is formulated on a
    dielectric basis calculations are made of a the contribution to
    the permittivity arising from the hydrogenic donor atoms b the
    donor activation energy and c the effect of screening by
    conduction electrons
