study of the relative frequency fluctuations of two
    reflex klystrons stabilized by different methods in connection
    with projected experiments of the michelson type it was desired
    to ascertain whether a variation of due to modulation could be
    detected in the frequency of oscillations modulated at a study
    was made of the inherent frequency fluctuations of klystron
    oscillators and of methods for limiting them with particular
    reference to the stabilization of supply sources alternative
    electronic methods involving use of waveguides and cavity
    resonators were used to stabilize the frequency of the beat
    between the two klystron oscillations one of which was
    modulated filters of bandwidth were used to improve this
    stability results are compared with those of pound of and essen
    they indicate that it should be possible with present day
    techniques to detect a frequency variation of the order of
