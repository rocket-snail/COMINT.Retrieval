another look at oclc's potential for special libraries.
    the issue of oclc benefits for special libraries is discussed
    in terms of 'find rates'. a stratified random sample revealed
    that 21% of a special collection's holdings were in the oclc
    data base and were scattered among 95 libraries. this low find
    rate is useful for documenting the uniqueness of the special
    collection and the lack of existing bibliographical control for
    such material. the study suggests that special libraries
    consider oclc participation when find rates are low based on
    considerations other than cost savings for technical
    services.
