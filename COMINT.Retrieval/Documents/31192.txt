preselecting literature for routine delivery to
    physicians in a community hospital-based patient care related
    reading program. reports on the development in boston,
    massachusetts, of patient care related reading (pcrr), an
    extension of literature attached to charts (latch) and clinical
    medical librarianship (cml). packets of literature on certain
    clinical disorders are prepared by the hospital librarian,
    reviewed by physicians, and amended accordingly by the
    librarian who then distributes them as a routine procedure to
    all physicians caring for patients with a diagnosis
    corresponding to a prepared topic. pcrr reinforces the concept
    of the community hospital library as a service-oriented entity
    and helps to establish the library as an active partner in the
    development and implementation of hospital-based continuing
    education programmes.
