an introduction to information systems and technology.
    originally prepared for the royal institution of chartered
    surveyors (rics), uk, annual conference 1980. attempts to
    establish the effects of modern technology on all aspects of
    surveying. looks at general developments, including software
    backup, and seeks to relate these developments to the more
    specialised requirements of each branch of the profession and
    add further individual needs. the involvement of the rics in
    both advising and training its members is discussed, whilst the
    more specialist requirements of general office staff training
    are also reviewed. outlines methods whereby surveyors and the
    rics can keep abreast of further developments during the next
    decade and make suggestions and recommendations which would
    affect future rics policy.
