positive results of coordination. regulations on
    bibliography coordination in slovakia issued 2 years ago
    stipulate 3 categories of bibliographic centres interlinked
    both vertically and horizontally to bring about a comprehensive
    network, in which even regional needs and demands are catered
    for. the scientific state library in banska bystrica has the
    authority and responsibility to coordinate bibliographies
    covering the antifascist resistance movement during world war
    ii and the slovak national uprising in 1944. during the years
    1979-80, the total bibliographic output in this field was 6,400
    copies of 39 headings, with a total of 4,311 pages and 11,142
    annotations. the next major task confronting the library staff
    is the compilation of a critical comprehensive bibliography on
    the aforesaid topics. a plan of future publications has also to
    be worked out in detail.
