the frequency response analysis of nonlinear systems if
    the waveform at the input to the nonlinear elements in the
    system is approximately sinusoidal the analysis may be carried
    out on the assumption that all harmonics generated by the
    nonlinear elements can be ignored analysis of on off control
    systems on this basis gives results within about of the exact
    solutions for both transient and steady oscillations
