changing concepts of the role and objectives of the
    public library in palestine, as exemplified by the sha'ar zion
    library in jaffa and tel-aviv (in hebrew). traces the evolving
    conceptions of the role and objectives of the sha'ar zion
    public library as formulated by its founders, librarians and
    the town fathers during the period of the 1st 4 waves of
    zionist immigration, from the 1880s to 1931. the emphasis is on
    analysis of the clash between the concept of the popular public
    library, whose primary purpose was to serve predominantly the
    immediate and topical needs of the immigrants and help in their
    absorption, and the concept of the scholarly public library,
    which emphasises the provision of services to a limited
    clientele of scholars, writers and teachers in the field of
    jewish studies. opens with a description of the social
    background of the period. the 2nd part deals with the origins
    of the sha'ar zion library and the contribution of voluntary
    organisations such as the b'nai brith and b'nai moshe orders
    towards the formulation of its mission. the 3rd and 4th
    sections analyse the deliberations and contentions of members
    of the town council and of advisors with regard to library
    objectives during the period of the 3rd and 4th waves of
    immigration (1919-31). in the last section, attempts to draw
    some conclusions with regard to the role played by the public
    library in palestine in the process of realisation of zionist
    ideology, especially its function as an agency for educating
    the populace in the spirit of that ideology, and in realising
    the ideal of the creation of a new jewish society in palestine
    which would preserve and maintain its cultural excellence and
    supremacy.
