the effect upon pulse response of delay ariation at low
    and middle frequencies calculations are given for the magnitude
    and form of the distortion introduced into a square wave by a
    network or system which exhibits uniform transmission except
    for increasing phase delay in the low mid frequency region the
    fractional peak distortion is found to be equal to twice the
    area under the curve relating to frequency where is the delay
    relative to that at high frequencies the waveform of the
    distortion is given for several simple shapes of curve for this
    distortion is especially characteristic of vestigial sideband
    systems and occurs in television as a pre shoot before a
    transition and as a smear after it
