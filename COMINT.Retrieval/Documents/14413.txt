a logarithmic voltage quantizer details are give of an
    analogue to digital converter which provides an output pulse
    whose duration is proportional to the logarithm of the input
    voltage the output pulse duration being determined by counting
    the number of fixed frequency pulses occurring in the same
    interval range of input voltage is with a threshold input pulse
    length of
