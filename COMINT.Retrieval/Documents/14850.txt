comparative terminal realizations with alpha-geometric
    coding. it is considered desirable that a videotex system
    should be capable of transmitting both high and low quality
    graphics and terminals should be able to produce an image from
    either type of signal according to the terminal design. systems
    configurations are shown to illustrate terminals of various
    levels of sophistication. it is thought that in the near future
    the cost difference between the extremes of sophistication will
    not be great. reference is made to the capabilities of telidon
    software flexibility.
