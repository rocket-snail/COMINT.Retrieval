interim report with major consequences for libraries. the
    latest interim report from the norwegian juel committee on
    local government reform, 2new finance system for county
    authorities1, could seriously affect public libraries. if its
    proposals are implemented, financial arrangements between
    state, county and municipal authorities will be abolished, and
    state subsidies given only where absolutely essential. state
    support of libraries and cultural activities is considered
    neither desirable nor necessary. the state library office, in
    reply, considers the present state grants vital in operating a
    satisfactory library service according to the library act.
    local authorities are not legally obliged to administer county
    libraries; without state support, libraries might receive only
    minimal sums, leading at worst to the closure of county library
    services in some counties. since public and mobile libraries
    are nowadays closely linked to county libraries, this would
    seriously damage the provision of an adequate national library
    service.
