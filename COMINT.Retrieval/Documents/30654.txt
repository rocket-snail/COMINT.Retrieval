scattering of electromagnetic waves at an uneven surface
    scattering of waves incident at an angle such that no part of
    the surface is in a shadow is considered theoretically
    application of the results to two particular cases shows that
    surfaces of a trochoidal form will give appreciably greater
    backscatter than a sinusoidal surface of the same amplitude and
    wavelength
