oscillations of an inhomogeneous plasma in a magnetic
    field mathematical analysis of small oscillations of a hot
    plasma confined by a magnetic field shows that there are two
    types of wave a slow drift wave characteristic of an
    inhomogeneous plasma and a magneto acoustic wave if certain
    relations obtain the drift current can cause amplification of
    the oscillations criteria for an instability of this kind are
    derived
