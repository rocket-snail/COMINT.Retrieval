the secondary emission from copper and silver films
    obtained with primary electron energies below values obtained
    for the secondary emission ratio are lower than those hitherto
    recorded both ag and cu having a ratio in the primary energy
    range ev the difference is attributed to the improved vacuum
    conditions used measurements of the energy distribution of the
    secondary electrons for primary energies show that the
    secondary electrons are in fact elastically reflected primary
    electrons
