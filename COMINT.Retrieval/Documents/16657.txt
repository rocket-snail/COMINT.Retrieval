computer perception of topological symmetry via canonical
    numbering of atoms. an algorithm for perception of topological
    symmetry has been programmed for computer use. the algorithm is
    based on the concept of the smallest binary code for a graph
    and requires generation of all numberings for a structure which
    will produce the canonical form for the adjacency matrix. the
    unique adjacency matrix corresponds to the smallest possible
    (binary) number representing the structure when its rows are
    read from top to bottom and from left to right. operation of
    the program is illustrated with a selection of polycyclic
    structures.
