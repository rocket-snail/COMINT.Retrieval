the orbit of a charged particle in a constant magnetic
    field and a sinusoidal electric field explicit expressions are
    obtained for the particle orbit assuming that the effect of the
    electric field on the particle is merely to produce a
    perturbation on the motion which it would describe in the
    absence of th field
