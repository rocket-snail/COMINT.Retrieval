the determination of canonical reactance quadripoles with
    prescri ed iterative matrix the iterative matrix of any
    reactance quadripole is realized by means of canonical circuits
    the method consists in developing a two pole function into a
    continued fraction this function represents the impedance of
    the two pole network which results from terminating by unity
    resistance the output of a quadripole realizing the given
    matrix
