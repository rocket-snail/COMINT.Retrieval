ionospheric thermal radiation at radio frequencies part
    further observations continuation of work reported previously
    pawsey et al observations were made at frequencies near over a
    period of about a year at a site chosen to minimize man made
    noise the location of the absorbing regions was deduced from
    consideration of pulse echo observations of the d region made
    on of gardner and pawsey the ionosphere temperatures deduced
    ranged from about to varying appreciably from day to day and
    being lower and less variable in winter an increase of up to
    during sudden ionospheric distinct disturbances is probably do
    due to a change of height of the absorbing region polarization
    measurements in september indicated that the absorbing regions
    were then located at a level where the temperature decreased
    with height
