line equations for an inhomogeneous line system of
    cylindrical symmetry and their application to circuit elements
    examples considered include the calculation of the skin effect
    of cylindrical wires the frequency response of disk type and
    wound capacitors and the impedance of a sintered ta
    electrolytic capacitor
