the central library of the university of forestry and
    timber industry in sopron. the library of the university of
    forestry and timber industry dates back to the 18th century. a
    school of mining was founded by king karl iii in 1735. this
    school developed and from 1770 also taught forestry science. in
    1808 it became an institute of forestry, and this reflected on
    the contents of the library which expanded to cover new subject
    areas. the institute became the academy of mining and forestry
    in 1846 and only acquired university status in 1934. the
    library development had been hampered by the 1st world war,
    inadequate buildings and lack of staff. with the founding of
    the university a new library was also planned. the new library
    building was opened in 1977. it is the only one of its kind in
    hungary, devoted entirely to specialist literature concerning
    forestry and the timber industry. the library is equipped with
    the latest technical facilities and provides an excellent
    service to its users.
