research report. codoc revised: the treatment of official
    publications at montreal ecole polytechnique. discusses
    experience with the codoc automated system for local treatment
    of official publications. the operation of the system is
    outlined and its relative advantages and inconveniences
    analysed and weighed. after 2 years, the ecole polytechnique
    withdrew from the group primarily because of the great
    disparity of forms of entry for 1 single organisation, and
    instead created its own approach using the catss identification
    system. the modifications made in adapting elements of both
    systems to meet ecole polytechnique requirements are described,
    and the operation of the new system to date evaluated.
