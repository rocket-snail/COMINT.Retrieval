the determination of ionospheric electron content from
    satellite doppler measurements part method of analysis theory
    is given which is based on measurements of the slopes of the
    differential doppler and the doppler curves obtained from
    observations of the transmission at and from sputnik a semi
    empirical formula is derived for the total electron
    content
