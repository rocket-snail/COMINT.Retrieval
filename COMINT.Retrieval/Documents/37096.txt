a servo system for digital data transmission the
    stability of the servo system is affected by the quantized
    nature of the digital data and by time delays inherent in the
    transmission and digital systems a method of synthesis is
    discussed enabling a degree of prediction to be incorporated
    which ensures that the regenerated data do not lag on the
    original data under steady state conditions
