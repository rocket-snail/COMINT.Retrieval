in touch with the future. describes evanston public
    library's automation system. in 1978 the library installed an
    on-line issue control system by clsi. with author and title
    data already in the data base, the introduction of an on-line
    public access catalogue with a touch sensitive terminal, opened
    in oct 80, was facilitated. the card catalogue is, however,
    being maintained, as the input of subject data is not yet
    complete and as a safeguard against computer break-downs. the
    extra costs involved had not been foreseen, and savings on
    staff are not yet possible. it is, therefore, difficult to
    calculate the long-term savings from automation. the
    professional gains are, however, clear' the catalogue enables
    precise location of material and compilation of useful
    statistics, and simplifies alterations. moreover, terminals can
    be placed outside the library, in the town hall and educational
    institutions.
