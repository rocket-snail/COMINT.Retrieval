the application of readability and other techniques of
    linguistic analysis to library and information science. final
    report for the period march-may 1979. 13 cities were visited to
    meet experts on reading, education, psychology, data
    processing, linguistics and librarianship. several
    recommendations resulted from these visits. they include' (a)
    the setting up of a very low budget research unit to collect
    and disseminate information; (b) future research on the better
    presentation of readability data to teachers and librarians;
    (c) more work on the linguistic changes involved in summarising
    text; (d) more emphasis on what the reader does with
    information retrieved, especially in public libraries; and (e)
    investigation of education in the use of literature as one of a
    standard range of study skills.
