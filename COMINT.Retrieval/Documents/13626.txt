economies that affect the heart of the service' a 2buch
    und bibliothek1 discussion on assisted library budgets. report
    of discussion between friedrich andrae, klaus hohlfeld, ulrich
    thiem, hans joachim vogt and 2buch und bibliothek1 held at the
    german library association's annual conference in bremen, nov
    81. it is a librarian's job to promote the use of books, a job
    which must be taken more seriously than ever before. recent
    surveys have shown that about 40% of the population are library
    users. where possible, economies should be made in working
    methods rather than in services; this demands more
    centralisation. it is better to put books in laundry baskets on
    window ledges and on pavements than to take them away from the
    public completely or to make them available only for restricted
    periods. libraries make a valuable contribution towards the
    mastery of life's problems, an argument which politicians and
    administrators are beginning to appreciate.
