piezoelectric excitation of quartz oscillators operating
    in the thickness mode by means of a parallel field the parallel
    field excitation of at and bt cut crystals is considered and
    its advantages are discussed equivalent circuits are given of
    two experimental oscillators for and using cut quartz crystal
    resonators
