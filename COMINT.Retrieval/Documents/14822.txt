theory of the anomalous skin effect in normal and
    superconducting metals the current density in a normal metal in
    which the electric field varies over a mean free path is
    derived from a quantum approach in which use is made of the
    density matrix in the presence of scattering centres but in the
    absence of the field the method is applied to
    superconductors
