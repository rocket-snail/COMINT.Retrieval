the use of secondary information sources for patent
    information. the expansion of industrially oriented patent
    information services means that information on patents must be
    qualitatively and quantitatively improved, which presupposes
    the use of rational procedures for obtaining patent
    descriptions. with examples taken from patent descriptions from
    east and west germany, the advantages and disadvantages of
    subject documentation through the use of primary sources or
    abstracts are presented. generally the best results are
    achieved when content analysis is based on an abstract or
    summary; primary sources are often of excellent quality,
    especially those from east germany, but their use can be
    expensive and time-consuming.
