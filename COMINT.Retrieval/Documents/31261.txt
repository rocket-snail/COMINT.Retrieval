quantitative relationships between descriptors and
    non-descriptors in thesauri. about 40 thesauri or collections
    of subject terminology equivalent to thesauri were studied with
    regard to quantity ratios between descriptors and
    non-descriptors or between descriptors and a total vocabulary.
    with the help of regression analysis, linear connections were
    made with a strongly emphasised correlation between the number
    of descriptors and the non-descriptors. then the number of
    non-descriptors was found to increase more slowly than that of
    the descriptors, demonstrating that the proportion of
    non-descriptors to the total vocabulary decreases as the number
    of descriptors increases. the inis thesaurus (international
    nuclear information system) is described in relation to this
    theory and found to be well produced.
