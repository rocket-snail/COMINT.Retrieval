the catalogue of an 18th century reading library. the
    reading libraries were forerunners of the modern public
    library; they were founded in the 18th century, at the time of
    the enlightenment, as profit-making institutions by
    middle-class citizens for educational and recreational
    purposes. the catalogue of 1 such library, die arnoldsche
    bibliothek in budissen, 1799-1806, is 1 of the rare books in
    the public library of potsdam. comprising a main volume and 13
    supplements, it lists 7,000 titles in accession order. the
    library stocked mainly fiction from germany and abroad, of
    which some works have now become classics. the fiction stock
    also reflected the contemporary enthusiasm for tales about
    mediaeval chivalry and the supernatural. there were also about
    400 dramatic works and 100 on travel and contemporary
    history.
