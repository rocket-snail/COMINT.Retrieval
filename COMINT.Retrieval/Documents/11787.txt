dc stability of transistor circuits the design of
    amplifiers using junction transistors is discussed with
    particular reference to the influence of the base to collector
    leakage current which increases rapidly with rising temperature
    for stable operation the change of collector current produced
    by a change of leakage current should be low circuit
    arrangements for achieving this are indicated
