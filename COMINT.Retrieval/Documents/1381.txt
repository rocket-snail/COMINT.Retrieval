magneto ionic theory of weakly ionized gases in the
    presence of an oscillating electric field and a constant
    magnetic field the velocity distribution functions for a
    nonuniformly ionized gas are calculated by solving the
    boltzmann differential equations explicit expressions are
    derived for the magneto ionic conductivity the dielectric
    tensor the hall effect the deflection of the electron beam and
    the generalization of langevins mobility formula comparison is
    made with other methods of calculation
