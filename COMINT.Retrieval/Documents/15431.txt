the relationship between atmospheric radio noise and
    lightning in europe atmospherics in a bandwidth of at have
    median amplitude amplitude range and frequency occurrence in
    accordance with that expected from lightning discharges to the
    ground in australia atmospherics from tropical storms were
    found to consist of numerous pulses the largest of which
    probably originated in ground strokes the origin of the smaller
    pulses is not clear some observations on atmospherics in the hf
    band are also described
