method of obtaining pressure and temperature insensitive
    microwave cavity resonators methods using invar walls with
    steel or brass end plates for te cavities are unsatisfactory
    due to hysteresis effects improved techniques are described for
    fixed frequency resonators which have temperature coefficients
    less than per the pressure coefficient is less than in per
    millibar
