ray paths from a cosmic radio source to a satellite in
    orbit a satellite above the maximum can receive radiation on
    frequencies that are totally reflected by the ionosphere two
    effects of reflection in the upper part of the ionosphere are
    discussed focusing and interference both occur particularly
    when s a satellite enters or leaves a region in which it can
    receive radiation from a point source in space
