on the scattering cross section of an obstacle the
    relation between th scattering cross section and the scattered
    amplitude for an obstacle in an incident plane wave previously
    discussed by is here established by a calculation of the energy
    flow when the incident wave emanates from a point source the
    sum of the scattering and absorption cross sections is
    determined by the value of a certain field in the neighbourhood
    of the source the discussion is presented in terms of an wave
    but is adaptable to sound waves or atomic collisions
