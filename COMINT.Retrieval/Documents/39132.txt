law concerning the unified system of socio-economic
    information and library statistics. in 1971 the federal
    assembly of the czechoslovak socialist republic decreed by law
    the formation of a unified system of socio-economic
    information. its practical implications are investigated here,
    mainly in regard to library statistics provided within the
    system. an in-depth analysis of the current state of library
    and information centre statistics was carried out in 1979; it
    showed many shortcomings concerning statistical indexes and
    their definition. as a result a unified statistical system was
    introduced which is here discussed in detail.
