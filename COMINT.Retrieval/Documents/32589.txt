a new dc electronic voltage stabilizing circuit the
    detecting element across the supply consists of a negative
    resistance and a positive resistance nce element of equal
    numerical values in series by controlling the negative
    resistance complete compensation can be achieved a circuit
    built on a similar principle but using a different type of
    negative resistance element was described by patchett of a
    stabilizer with an output of is described in detail the output
    can be maintained constant to within for an input fluctuation
    of and a load variation of the circuit is suitable for voltages
    from upwards
