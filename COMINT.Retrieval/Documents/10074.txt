cooperative cataloguing system-regional or national.
    extensive treatment covering the present situation in theory
    and practice. the main points are the general and specific
    criticisms of the recommendations put forward by the german
    research society, and the function, performance and costs of a
    national cooperative system compared with 7 independent
    regional cataloguing systems. it is concluded that while a
    national system would offer many technical and bibliographical
    advantages, there is no national consensus for its
    establishment.
