ionospheric currents responsible for sudden commencements
    observed at the geomagnetic equator the height and strength of
    the line current which would account for the sc at two
    equatorial stations is calculated for storms the height is
    found to lie between and is independent of the local time of sc
    a more realistic sheet current model is examined and is found
    to be insensitive to height an explanation of enhanced at the
    equator is given
