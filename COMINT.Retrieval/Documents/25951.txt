theory of the anisotropy of the width of ferromagnetic
    resonance absorption lines the dependence of the width of a
    radio frequency resonance absorption line on the internal field
    is derived from the landau lifshits equation and examples of
    ferrites with single axis and cubic symmetry are
    examined
