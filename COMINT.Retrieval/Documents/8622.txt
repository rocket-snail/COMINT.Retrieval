services for school libraries. regional school library
    centres in the rhineland palatinate offer advice and practical
    assistance to general and vocational schools concerning spatial
    planning and equipment, library procedures such as cataloguing,
    purchasing, loans and the use of audio-visual media, and
    administration. the centres can provide critical book reviews
    and opinions on the range and costs of books. they can arrange
    block loans of books to schools from their own stocks and
    supply requested individual titles through inter-library loan.
    they prepare basic stock lists, disseminate information and
    organise conferences. the centres need more staff if they are
    to keep pace with demands by school libraries for more
    centralised services.
