an analysis of drifts of the signal pattern associated
    with ionospheric reflections a statistic treatment to determine
    the drift and random velocity components from the signals
    observed on three spaced receivers particular attention is
    given to the random motion in order to examine the detailed
    movement of the pattern the results suggest a ruled pattern
    undergoing fluctuations in contour spacing as the pattern
    drifts across the receiver site
