public library development. statistics on public
    libraries in east germany for 1976-80 reveal increases in
    stocks, loans and users. in 1980 stocks totalled over 36
    million items, loans over 79 million and readers over 3
    million. development has been slightly slower than during the
    previous 5 years, partly because a high standard had already
    been reached and partly because more organisational
    improvements were required. plans for stock expansion have gone
    ahead because the state publishing industry's production
    figures have increased. the planned total stock expansion
    figure has been exceeded and efforts were made to keep stocks
    up to date. total library expenditure in 1980 was 111,642,600
    m, reflecting continual increases in expenditure.
