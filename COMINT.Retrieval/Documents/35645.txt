frequencies and power of waves radiated by a magnetic
    undulator continuation of investigation noted in above the
    dimensions of an undulator for generating mm waves are
    determined from rigorous calculations of electron trajectories
    the results differe greatly from values derived from classical
    theory the values found for radiated power are of the same
    order
