effects of heater voltage variations of valves in certain
    stabilizer circuits calculations further to those presented
    previously show that in series parallel stabilizer circuits
    having a resistor in the cathode lead of the amplifier the
    effect of heater voltage variations is not serious because the
    two valves produce output voltage changes of opposite
    sign
