the christelijk lektuur centrum (christian literature
    centre), or' an attempt at a christian contribution. the
    christelijk lektuur centrum was founded in the netherlands in
    1968 as successor to the bond van christelijke openbare
    leeszalen en bibliotheken (association of christian public
    reading rooms and libraries). the aim of the centre was to
    promote the formation of a network of protestant-oriented
    public libraries throughout the country. however, at the time
    of the centre's foundation a number of librarians had proposed
    that a single national organisation free from religious bias be
    created to supervise library affairs in the netherlands. as a
    result of the proposals the nederlands bibliotheek en lectuur
    centrum (dutch centre for libraries and literature) was formed
    in 1972. the clc was absorbed into the new organisation as a
    separate sub-group and through the nblc has been able to
    promote the position of the protestant church in library
    affairs.
