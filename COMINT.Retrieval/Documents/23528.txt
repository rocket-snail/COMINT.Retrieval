library work with the elderly and handicapped. bonn
    public library service for senior citizens and the housebound
    was created 15 years ago. it is organised by the librarian of a
    branch library specialising in large print material and
    programmes of activities for the elderly. the librarian visits
    all prospective readers to find out their requirements; close
    personal contact between staff and readers is essential. each
    of the 180 readers is visited once in every 4 weeks, when books
    are issued, renewed or returned within a specially simplified
    system. the branch library supplies about 80% of the stock and
    publishes an annual list of large print books held. the main
    problem for these readers is poor sight so large print books
    are essential; books should also not be heavy since some
    readers have difficulty holding them.
