height of nighttime f layer irregularities at the equator
    satellite transmissions propagated through the irregularities
    produce a diffraction pattern from whose velocity the effective
    height of the diffracting screen may be determined
    irregularities are elongated with axial ratio at least along
    the earths magnetic field and lie between and above the base of
    the f layer
