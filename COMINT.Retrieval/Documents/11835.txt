cosmic radio frequency radiation near one megacycle
    observations were made of cosmic radiation at and during the
    period march october at hobart tasmania photographs of specimen
    records are reproduced for values of the critical frequency
    near the observing frequency there is strong correlation
    between critical frequency and received amplitude for lower
    values of critical frequency the received amplitude increases
    to an independent limiting value the greatest intensity of the
    radiation arriving from the zenith when the plane of the galaxy
    was overhead was steradian at only ordinary ionospheric
    propagation was important in the observations recorded
