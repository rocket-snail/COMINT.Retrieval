citation rates to technologically important patents. the
    purpose of this study was to determine whether the average
    number of citations received by issued us patents from
    subsequently issued us patents is higher for patents associated
    with important technological advances than for a group of
    randomly selected patents. analysis of examiners' citations to
    100 selected patents showed that these selected patents, which
    underlay technically important products, were more than twice
    as frequently cited as a randomly selected set of 102 control
    patents. this finding provides strong evidence for the
    hypothesis that patent citation data can be used in
    technological indicators development, and in technological
    policy analysis, since it implies that the location and
    analysis of groups of highly cited patents can provide a valid
    indicator of patent areas of technical importance.
