viewdata and the information age-part 2' theory into
    practice. viewdata applications are said to be divided into 4
    main areas' residential, public, business, and specialised.
    predicts that, within 3 years, the ratio of domestic to
    business users will be around 5 to 1. various applications are
    described (e.g. viewdata adapted to help the deaf communicate
    via telephone). particular reference is made to the use of
    microcomputers as videotex receivers (or vice versa) to form
    the basis of telesoftware. a bright future is predicted for
    viewdata and teletext with plenty of potential for diverse
    applications, especially when coupled with home
    microcomputers.
