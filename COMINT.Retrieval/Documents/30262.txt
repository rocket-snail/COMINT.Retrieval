propagation of a plane aerodynamic wave of semidiurnal
    oscillation period through a plane ionosphere in a uniform
    magnetic field analysis is based on the momentum equation for
    the gas and the tensor equation of electric conduction derived
    earlier of july frequency and wave length correspond to the
    atmospheric oscillations caused by tidal effects of the sun and
    the moon the solution indicates that em damping of the
    atmospheric oscillations will occur at height the electrical
    conductivity in a horizontal and in a vertical magnetic field
    is expressed as a function of the neutral gas density
