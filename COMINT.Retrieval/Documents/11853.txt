it's a squash in naestved. report on naestved public
    library, including interviews with users and the librarian. the
    library is centrally placed, has a total of 1614 sq.m. on 3
    floors and employs 36 staff. with a population of 45,000,
    naestved now needs a main library of 4000 sq.m. in addition to
    the planned branch library serving the town's east end.
    interviews users of the newspaper reading room, the general
    lending section, the music library, which lends records and
    tapes, and the children's library; most of these were satisfied
    with the services. cuts have not affected acquisitions as much
    as feared, but services such as the home loan service to the
    elderly and the mobile library services are overstretched, and
    space for meetings and arrangements is inadequate. films are
    shown in the local cinema.
