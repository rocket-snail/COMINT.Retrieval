investigation of the solid component of interplanetary
    matter by means of rockets and artificial earth satellites the
    kinetic energy of micrometeorites is measured by an acoustic
    method or by a new type of sensitive photomultiplier results of
    collisions of these particles with polished plates located on
    rockets are shown tables giving values of brightness mass
    radius and estimated fall out on the earth in hours are
    included particles ejected from the sun and charged cosmic dust
    are also considered
