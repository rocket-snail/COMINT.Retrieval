noise discriminator for periodic signals the periodic
    signal of any waveform is applied through a phase inverter to
    one pair of terminals of a resistance bridge including two
    diode rectifiers periodic pulses are applied to the other pair
    of bridge terminals during each pulse the diodes are unblocked
    and the signal passes to an integrating circuit with an
    adjustable time constant if the pulse frequency is slightly
    greater than the signal frequency the output obtained has the
    waveform of the noise free input signal and a much lower
    frequency random noise mains interference and any other
    disturbance of a frequency which is not a multiple of the
    signal frequency will not be reproduced the unit was designed
    for use with nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus
