double doppler study of meteoric echoes both the
    amplitude and phase of the signal returned from a meteor trail
    can be determined independently by use of a twin channel
    doppler system details of which are presented the technique has
    direct application to the determination of the drift of meteor
    trails and to analysis of the spectra of echoes which exhibit
    amplitude fading
