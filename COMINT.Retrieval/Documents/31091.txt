teleordering-a luxury?. paper presented at the public
    libraries group weekend school. the author is a director of
    h&a john (booksellers) ltd. discusses the implementation
    and operation by a uk bookseller of software sciences
    teleordering, a computer based communication system between
    booksellers and publishers using isbns. gives brief technical
    details of the hardware used, and describes a typical operation
    sequence. shows that teleordering is an easy to use and
    efficient means of sending orders and hopefully eventually,
    cancellations and possibly chasers. notes some of the
    implications of teleordering for librarians, particularly the
    better service on supply of books and of reports. suggests that
    the booksellers association and the library association should
    consider the possible uses of teleordering together.
