feedback stabilized transistor amplifier loading of the
    feedback network is avoided by the use of an emitter coupled
    differential amplifier in the first stage a three stage
    amplifier using ge transistors gives an overall gain of
    independent of the transistors used si junction transistors
    give more stable operation at high ambient temperatures
    circuits and component values for typical amplifiers are
    given
