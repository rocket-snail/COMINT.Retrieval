frequency feedback discussion of a phenomenon which
    occurs in all resonant systems possessing a relation between
    resonance frequency and amplitude in such systems there may be
    an external feedback channel or internal feedback due to
    nonlinear reactors or to nonlinear resistors combined with
    fixed reactors as in the so called rx modulators the phenomenon
    shows itself in asymmetrical deformation of the resonance curve
    applications of the effect in a m fm conversion and in fm
    conversion for frequency shift reception are noted
