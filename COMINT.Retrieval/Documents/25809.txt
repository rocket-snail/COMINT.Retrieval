information and bibliographical reference work at a new
    level in centralised systems. centralised library systems have
    responded in a variety of ways to the call for greater
    development of information work. examples from all over the
    ussr show how they have undertaken more book promotion and
    information dissemination; organised surveys to ascertain the
    information needs in their area; paid particular attention to
    the needs of agricultural workers; and established important
    links with the scientific and technical information centres at
    republican level. public libraries, mindful of their role to
    serve the whole community, are also turning their attention to
    the needs of political workers, teachers and others outside the
    sphere of material production.
