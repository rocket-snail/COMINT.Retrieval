fm transistor oscillator a titant titanate capacitor is
    coupled to the resonant circuit inductor of the transistor
    oscillator the transformation ratio being chosen at will
    varying the potential applied to this capacitor alters its
    effective capacitance and hence the resonance frequency a
    polarization potential is applied from a zamboni pile to keep
    the capacitance variations within the linear range a oscillator
    constructed used a junction transistor and had a power output
    of when supplied from a battery the titanate capacitor
    consisted of two series connected units a oscillator using a
    type point contact transistor gave similar results some form of
    a fc is desirable in view of the temperature variations of the
    components
