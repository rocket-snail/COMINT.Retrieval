corbino disk a comprehensive treatment of the behaviour
    of the electric current and magnetic field distribution
    patterns in a disk with concentric inner and u outer contacts
    and a magnetic field applied along its axis the effects
    discussed are large in materials with a high mobility such as
    bi ad the corbino disk appears to be useful as a rectifier and
    voltage regulator
