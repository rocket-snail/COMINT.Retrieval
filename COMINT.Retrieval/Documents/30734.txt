library network in the slovak socialist republic and its
    future development. the recent communist party congress and
    requirements of the 7th 5-year-plan (1981-85) have given a new
    impetus to the whole library network in slovakia. since 1 jan
    82, a special section of matica slovenska, based in bratislava,
    has been in operation. its staff have to watch, direct and
    control both short- and long-term planning in libraries. they
    will also care for coordination between libraries and centres
    of scientific, technical and economic information. contacts
    with libraries in the czech socialist republic as well as
    international connections will also be furthered. the overall
    responsibility for libraries, however, rests upon the slovak
    ministry of culture. for their part, the ministry's officials
    will make every effort towards unification and/or
    standardisation of all library activities, including building
    up book collections, records, statistics and the like. among
    other problems which must be tackled in the forseeable future
    are computerisation, mergers of public and school libraries,
    where appropriate, and incorporation of public libraries into
    local cultural institutions.
