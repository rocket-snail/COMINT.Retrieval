the suitability of book and article titles for subject
    cataloguing. for economic reasons the viability of automated
    subject cataloguing using main entries is often considered.
    basic data available for this are the title, sub-title and cip
    data but although the title may important it does not always
    express the subject content accurately. in popular literature
    the title may be eye-catching rather than accurate. problems
    can also be caused by foreign languages, abbreviations,
    shortened or lengthened names for the same object, homonyms and
    synonyms, especially in geographical material. many titles are
    vague and incomplete or even incomprehensible if the subject of
    the book is not already known. use of the title in automated
    subject cataloguing would save work time but result in many
    false entries.
