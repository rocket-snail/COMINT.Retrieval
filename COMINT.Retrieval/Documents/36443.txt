the relations between circuit pass band and signal build
    up time two pass band criteria are discussed namely the
    bandwidth between the points and the bandwidth defined in terms
    of special distribution it is shown that these are not uniquely
    related and that it is not possible to determine the time
    constant of a circuit solely from a knowledge of its
    bandwidth
