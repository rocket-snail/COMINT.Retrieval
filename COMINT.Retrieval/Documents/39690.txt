altered keyword in context (akwic) indexing. the
    definition of kwic index, its origin and the method of
    production is described. it is stressed that continuity of the
    context at the extreme edges should be maintained whenever the
    beginning or the end of a title forms part of a kwic entry. a
    modification in the output format of the kwic index which can
    be termed the 'altered kwic' or akwic index, has been
    suggested. advantages of akwic over kwic are mentioned. some of
    the limitations of kwic and akwic are pointed out. it is
    suggested that adoption of kwic index by indian periodicals and
    organisations should be encouraged.
