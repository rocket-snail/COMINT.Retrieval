symmetrical properties of transistors and their
    applications symmetry of one kind is found in the complementary
    characteristics of the npn and pnp types of junction transistor
    by using these two types in combination reduction of the number
    of components and other circuit simplifications can be achieved
    particularly in single ended push pull amplifiers symmetry f a
    second kind can be found in single transistors and is evidenced
    by interchangeability as regards operation of emitter and
    collector use is made of this property in switching circuits eg
    for clamping and modulation and for a high efficiency
    television deflection circuit
