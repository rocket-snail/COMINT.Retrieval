the removal and equipping of an industrial library. the
    library of the de voorst hydraulics laboratory in the
    noordoostpolder in the netherlands began with a small
    collection of documents in 1963. by 1980 the library contained
    over 20,000 documents, annual loans totalled almost 10,000 and
    the collection had long outgrown the original library building.
    in 1975 plans had already been drawn up for a new library with
    a working area of 200 sq.m. together with a further 200 sq.m.
    of underground storage area for archival material. the public,
    staff and bookstack areas were planned to provide the most
    efficient layout for readers and staff and removal of the
    collection to the new library was carefully planned in advance
    to minimise disruption to the library's services.
