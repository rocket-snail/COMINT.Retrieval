experiences of designing a data base for clinical trials
    information using an english language database management
    system. the problems encountered using a manual system to
    manage data generated by clinical trials at smith kline and
    french, are highlighted. the development of a computer system
    for handling clinical trials' data, using data base techniques,
    is presented. the problems encountered and the benefits gained
    from using both hierarchical tree and network structures are
    discussed. the disciplines enforced by a computer system
    necessitated some changes in the design of the documents used
    to record the raw data. these changes are described. about half
    of the clinical trials' data are qualitative or textual, and
    the problems inherent in computerising this type of data and
    their solutions are presented.
