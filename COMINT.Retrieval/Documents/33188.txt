journals in libraries. there have always been problems
    connected with journal collections in libraries. collections
    were often incomplete, unsuitably stored and often impossible
    to locate owing to incomplete cataloguing. 1 improvement was
    the introduction of microfilm which was easier to store and
    meant that original journal copies could be stored in the
    archives and not damaged by continual use. the association of
    german librarians' commission for journals has published
    important material dealing with the best ways of storing and
    cataloguing journal collections and cooperative filming with
    other libraries. an important aid to locating journals is gerd
    hagelweide's location catalogue deutsche zeitungsbestande in
    bibliotheken und archiven (german journal collections in
    libraries and archives). the publication of regional journal
    catalogues in westphalia, berlin, hesse and wurtemberg has
    helped to improve lending systems in these areas.
