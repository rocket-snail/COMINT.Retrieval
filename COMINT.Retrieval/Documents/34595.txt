a survey of the present knowledge of sporadic e
    ionization discussion of the various techniques of observi g e
    and the classification of the phenomenon by geographical zones
    auroral temperate and equatorial and by type as evidenced by
    the trace recorded on an ionogram the diurnal and seasonal
    variations in the three zones are shown to be quite distinct
    various theories of the nature of the ionization formations and
    the agencies producing them are considered and the subjects
    requiring special experimental and theoretical attention are
    indicated over references
