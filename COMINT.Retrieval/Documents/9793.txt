national scientific and technological information
    policies and programmes. a review of activities in developed
    and developing countries, based on recent literature, with
    special reference to the latin american situation, undertaken
    by ibict, the brazilian institute of scientific and
    technological information in 1979. after an introductory
    explanation of basic terminology, the survey gives detailed
    accounts of recent national projects and developments, and of
    existing and projected international cooperative networks in
    europe and latin america. the conclusion compares the situation
    in developed countries, where government policy is to invest
    strongly in increasing efficiency of information services, with
    that in developing countries, where information resources are
    precarious and dependent on foreign technology, while
    government policy lacks determination in developing realistic
    programmes.
