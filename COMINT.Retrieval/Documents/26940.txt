a study of the behaviour of users of the services of a
    special library. report of an investigation carried out at the
    brazilian nuclear energy research institute (instituto de
    pesquisas energeticas e nucleares) in 1979, to establish
    reasons for low use of the scientific information and
    documentation services, for planning and reorganisation
    purposes. a preliminary review of recent literature on library
    user studies is presented. data was collected by questionnaire
    and from statistical records. results are reported in full,
    giving details of user characteristics; habits of library
    frequentation; use of services; use of library publications;
    and the influence of user training on library habits. the
    initial hypotheses, that services were not geared to existing
    user habits although adequate for research needs, and that
    previous training increased use, were borne out. the need to
    promote services is emphasised in conclusion.
