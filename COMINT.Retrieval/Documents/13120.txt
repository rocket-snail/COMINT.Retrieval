directions for professional work in the service of

    libraries have reached a new stage in the development of their
    educational function. their aims now include the provision of
    more lists of recommended reading, more active propaganda of
    atheism, greater emphasis both on moral and aesthetic education
    and on scientific and technological innovation, and the
    effective use of television and radio. a single system for
    promoting books is required and libraries should further
    investigate a differentiated approach to reader services. there
    is a need for a new long-term educational project, based on
    coordinated research.
