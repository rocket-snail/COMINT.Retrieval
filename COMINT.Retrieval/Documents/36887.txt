experimental testing of the optimum retrieval strategy
    used in automated systems. an experiment to find the optimum
    information retrieval method for the automated system as used
    by the top management organs of the federal ministry of
    engineering and capital investment development is described. by
    means of a combination of various components, described here,
    16 methods were obtained which were then tested using a
    representative sample of documents dealing with top management
    and scientific, technical and economic information. the
    retrieval efficiency of each method was evaluated by means of
    coefficients intended to quantify the degree of retrieval
    completeness and accuracy.
