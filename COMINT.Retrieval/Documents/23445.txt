between administration and science: the image of the
    academic librarian in contemporary discussion. lecture given at
    the 10th advanced training seminar for librarians at the herzog
    august library in wolfenbuttel, feb 81. for years librarians
    have argued over the relationships between pure librarianship
    and administration in their work, which are particularly
    important when allotting tasks to the highest staff grades.
    librarians feel themselves to be inadequately represented when
    questions on university staffing arise and should strive for
    better coordination. administration is not part of the academic
    discipline of librarianship and close links must be established
    between this discipline and the academic librarian.
    administrative and professional duties for the highest staff
    grades, especially for heads of subject departments, must be
    clearly defined.
