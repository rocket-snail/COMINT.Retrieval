development of the theory of bibliographic description.
    an attempt is made to define the subject of an auxiliary
    scientific discipline devoted to the theory and methods of
    bibliographic description. the 3 main functions of
    bibliographic description are discussed: (1) information
    function (information about the existence of a certain
    document); (2) identification function (a document can be
    identified by bibliographic description); and (3) retrieval
    function (bibliographic description here is a means for
    retrieval of a document from an information system).
