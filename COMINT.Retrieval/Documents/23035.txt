information service activities of special subject
    collection libraries and central subject libraries. in 1973 the
    deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft (german research association)
    made recommendations about the activities of these libraries
    within the context of super-regional library provision.
    although standards generally have risen since then, financial
    difficulties are causing problems. university libraries have to
    concentrate on acquiring examination syllabus literature at the
    expense of research material. these libraries should be
    providing topical and comprehensive information services on
    their specialised subjects and a clearing house is needed to
    sort out the existing jungle of information sources. current
    and possible future developments are discussed for' periodical
    indexing; subject catalogues of periodicals; subject catalogues
    of libraries; current subject bibliographies; and acquisitions
    lists.
