study of solar rf radiation on around sunset and sunrise
    report of measurements made at paris using a parabolic mirror
    of diameter m graphs are presented showing the variation of
    refraction with solar angle and quasi periodic intensity
    variations observed when the angle of elevation is less than
    attenuation due to absorption by oxygen is observed at zn
    angles less than about
