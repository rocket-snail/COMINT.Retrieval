use of jois at tokyo women's medical college library.
    since the computerised retrieval service, jois, was made
    available at tokyo women's medical college in apr 79, the
    number of literature retrieval requests increased by more than
    100%. however, manual literature searches using japanese
    indexing journals are still being continued for 2 reasons' (1)
    on-line data bases included in jois only cover the last 5 years
    of literature; (2) japanese literature is not adequately
    covered. of the data bases available on jois, medlars was used
    the most, followed by toxline. the average search time was 7
    minutes for all data bases. 3 medlars search samples are
    shown.
