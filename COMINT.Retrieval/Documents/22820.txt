critical remarks on the description of the ionization in
    the ionospheric e layer changes from nominal value in the
    exponent of the cos law of e layer ionization are discussed
    these are necessitated by the difference between seasonal and
    daily variation of e layer noon values harnischmachers
    empirical formult for this exponent is not confirmed by an
    analysis of data the derivation of a world wide e layer
    character figure from data obtained at one locality is
    considered impossible in view of geographic differences in
    ionization characteristics
