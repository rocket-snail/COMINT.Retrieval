display systems in the electronic office. describes 2
    research projects based in the computer systems laboratory at
    queen mary college, university of london. one project, already
    completed, has produced a new piece of hardware-the 'q.m.c.
    text terminal'-which is a display system incorporating 2
    processors which are entirely devoted to providing a highly
    user-oriented display of textual information. the other
    project, still in progress, aims to develop a radically new
    display processor technology, the hope being that it will
    increase significantly the speed of image generation in bitmap
    display systems.
