nonlinear effects of the interaction of resonance fields
    in the molecular generator and amplifier analysis of a
    molecular oscillator with an auxiliary field based on the
    polarizability of a quantum system situated in two resonance
    fields such a system can operate at two frequencies which
    depend on the amplitude as well as the frequency of the
    anxiliary field
