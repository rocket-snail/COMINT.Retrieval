is it more cost-effective to print on- or offline?.
    questions the traditional assumption that it is less expensive
    to print search results off-line than to print them on-line.
    describes a simple formula to determine on-line print costs for
    comparison with off-line charges for 2 major data base vendors
    (lockheed and sdc). the equation permits the calculation of the
    maximum citation length at which off-line printing becomes
    economic. concludes that with local printing at 1200 baud,
    there is very little advantage to printing off-line.
