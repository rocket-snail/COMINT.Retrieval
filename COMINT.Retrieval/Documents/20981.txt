representation of electromagnetic fields of any frequency
    using the energy quantum model development of theory presented
    previously of wave propagation phenomena including reflection
    interference and diffraction are explained in terms of the
    energy quantum model static fields are also considered voltage
    current and characteristic impedance are related to mechanical
    quantities and an appropriate system of dimensions and units is
    presented
