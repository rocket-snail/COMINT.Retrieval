docile behaviour of feedback amplifiers a docile
    amplifier is one that remains stable when connected to any
    passive network of a specified class a simplified geometrical
    approach is used to derive the docility criteria for passive
    end loading ideal transformer feedback bilateral passive
    feedback and arbitrary passive feedback
