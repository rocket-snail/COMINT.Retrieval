the art of running a data library. data technology has
    appeared at the right time to help librarians with the greatly
    increased workload of recent years. retrospective literature
    searching and current literature awareness, for instance, can
    benefit greatly from automation. future developments are likely
    in the fields of social and community information services,
    fuller indexing to aid identification in the humanities,
    cataloguing of local collections, and indexing of audio-visual
    material. all public libraries should set about informing staff
    and public on the question of computerisation; the working
    party recently appointed should intensify their discussions on
    the swedish bums system development and automation in general;
    and contacts should be strengthened etween cultural and library
    organisations with a view to discussing automation in swedish
    public libraries.
