optimal distributed routing in data-communication
    networks. a model is developed for routing in data
    communication networks. it gives rise to a routing algorithm
    that can be implemented in a distributed fashion and
    furthermore has the properties of being loop-free, reducing the
    delay in the network at each step, and converging to optimal
    minimum delay routing.
