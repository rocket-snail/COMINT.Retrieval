it's worth the trouble' contact between bonn municipal
    library and the handicapped. the library loans books to and
    compiles book-lists for a rehabilitation centre for the
    handicapped and various clubs with both handicapped and
    non-handicapped members. children from a local kindergarten for
    both handicapped and non-handicapped children, hopefully a
    basis for future mixed school classes, visit the library
    regularly. the local school for the physically handicapped
    brings groups regularly to the library and successful classes
    have been held there for them together with non-handicapped
    children. the librarian gives guidance on books during training
    courses for the mentally handicapped and groups of mentally
    handicapped will be allowed to choose books in peace outside
    normal library hours.
