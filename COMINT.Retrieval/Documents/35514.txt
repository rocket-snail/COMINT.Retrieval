some impressions of canadian map librarians and their
    collections. a brief description of 4 ontario map collections
    visited by the author-at the universities of trent, brock, and
    toronto, and the national map collection in ottawa. the visits
    confirmed that the best staff qualifications are common sense,
    enthusiasm, and a love of the medium; a national map collection
    need not be held by a national library; map libraries and
    archives can form advantageous links; there should be a
    specific map classification code; a map library's activities
    should take into account collection size and user numbers; and
    although different opinions in the profession are valuable, it
    is too young a profession to endure dissent as violent as that
    in the usa, where it has been split into 4 factions.
