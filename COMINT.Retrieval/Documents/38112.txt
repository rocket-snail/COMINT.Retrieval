saturable reactor frequency divider a saturable reactor
    is used in conjunction with a rc network to provide a circuit
    capable of producing a pulse output at the frequency or a
    submultiple of the frequency of a sinusoidal input a circuit
    providing synchronizing pulses for a radar modulator at half
    the frequency of the power supply is described
