apparent intensity variations of the radio source hydra a
    over a period of months about observations of the intensity of
    hydra a were compared with observations on other strong sources
    the results indicate that hydra a is relatively much more
    variable though no periodic changes have been detected possible
    mechanisms producing the intensity changes are
    considered
