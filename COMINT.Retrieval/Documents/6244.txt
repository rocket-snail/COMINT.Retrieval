the sunspot number series because of the lack of a truly
    periodic term in the sunspot number series predictions have so
    far been made on an empirical basis a more satisfactory
    representation is obtained by plotting the numbers with
    reversed sign for alternative year periods to give a year cycle
    with practically zero mean value a significant degree of
    correlation is found between the slopes of adjacent flanks of
    the successive year cycles
