thesaurus of music classification according to motive,
    purpose and content. a german library institute project. the
    need for a definitive thesaurus of music has been recognised
    for many years and various steps have been taken towards a more
    comprehensive method of cataloguing musical content. the german
    library institute (deutsche bibliotheksinstitut (dbi)) has been
    working on a thesaurus of music since 1978. 1 of the greatest
    difficulties in the preparation was deciding which criteria
    were necessary for indexing music titles. work started by
    collecting material and examining each title to see whether it
    contained certain concepts which referred to the content. these
    formed the empiric base for the thesaurus vocabulary. the
    thesaurus will contain 500-600 terms which will be the future
    preferred indexing terms. the project is not yet completed but
    is ready to be tested by the municipal music library in munich
    in the framework of their cataloguing activity.
