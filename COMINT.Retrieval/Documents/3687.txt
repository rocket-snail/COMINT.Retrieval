uhf band pass filters a direct method is developed for
    designing waveguide and coaxial line filters the
    characteristics of a cavity filter are calculated transverse
    obstacles comprising sets of thin pins are shown to be better
    than diaphragms windows or single pins from the point of view
    of losses and of manufacture and adjustment cavities with q
    values of can easily be obtained using four pins of diameter mm
    design charts are given and several types of filter are
    described and illustrated
