transistor cascode circuit improves automatic gain
    control in amplifiers an improved method with circuit details
    for applying agc to transistor if tuned amplifiers is described
    the effects of changes in the transistor parameters with change
    of operating point on the q factor and the centre frequency of
    the tuned circuits are minimized
