geometrical transformation of impedance diagrams the
    limited impedance range of the normal circle diagram
    representation of impedances is noted a second type of circle
    diagram can be constructed in which all possible impedance
    values satisfying the required conditions lie within the unit
    circle its construction by means of riemanns number sphere is
    required
