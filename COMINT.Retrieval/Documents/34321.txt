the electromagnetic properties of a plane grating a plane
    grating is considered which consists of a number of parallel
    conducting planes between which electron streams pass and its
    waveguide properties are discussed taking into account the
    velocity scatter of the electrons a general solution of the
    problem is given for an arbitrary type o of scatter function
    the velocity scatter narrows the range of average velocities of
    the streams for which amplification is possible and displaces
    it towards the higher velocity values the maximum amplification
    is also reduced
