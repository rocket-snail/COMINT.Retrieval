in-service qualification at the wab(b) potsdam. in many
    large municipal libraries there are unqualified staff in
    specialist posts who have been unable for various reasons to
    study for professional qualifications. since 1979 potsdam
    research library has organised special in-service training
    courses for them, including general surveys of librarianship
    and public libraries in particular and specialist training in
    the work of their own departments. at the end of the 12 months'
    course each student receives a certificate of participation. it
    is essential for staff to have preliminary discussions with
    prospective students to give them information about the course
    and to get from them a promise to work hard. experience has
    shown that most students find the course helpful. this type of
    course can only be provided in a large library system.
