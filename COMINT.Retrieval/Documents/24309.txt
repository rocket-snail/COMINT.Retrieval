magnetic field of the sun the principles of operation of
    babcocks zeeman effect solar magnetograph are described and
    some experimental results obtained are shown in the form of
    magnetograms the general magnetic field strength is oersted of
    polarity opposite to that of the earth large local bipolar and
    unipolar fields have been observed and are shown in several of
    the magnetograms the field distribution varies from day to day
    and fluctuations of the order of oersted are believed to occur
    in local fields with periods of about min the unipolar fields
    are probably the sources of corpuscular emission which produce
    geomagnetic storms with a day recurrence period
