greens functions in evaluating fields analysis based on
    the derivation of vector potentials from scalar potentials is
    extended to cases in which the field varies with time an
    outline is given of the method used to calculate the field due
    to a current in a conductor applications include the
    calculation of fields in waveguides and resonant
    cavities
