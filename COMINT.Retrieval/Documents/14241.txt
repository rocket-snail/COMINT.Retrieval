study of the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of a
    reflecting surface analysis is given for the general case of a
    plane incident wave with elliptical polarization if the
    reflecting surface is an infinite plane the reflected wave is
    also plane modifications of the reflected wave by other types
    of reflecting surface are mentioned
