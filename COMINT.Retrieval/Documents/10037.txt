dyslexia. explains the meaning of this special impairment
    of the ability to read in its varied forms, its possible causes
    and how best to deal with children suffering from this sort of
    disorder, and how to help them to secure normal education.
    librarians should be able to select appropriate reading for
    them, e.g. short stories with a simple text, books with well
    defined print, illustrations etc., and make the children
    understand that overcoming their difficulties is not an
    achievement in itself but that there is a worthwhile story once
    the difficulties have been mastered.
