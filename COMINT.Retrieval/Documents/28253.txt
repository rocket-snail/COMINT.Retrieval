a library school course to teach graduate level students
    two commercial interactive systems. proficiency in searching 2
    commercial systems (dialog and orbit) is the objective of the
    15 week course taught to graduate students in the school of
    library and information science (slis) at pittsburgh
    university. software was developed to replicate the language,
    formats and search capabilities of dialog, orbit and brs. 60
    students are taught each term; the course is offered 3 times
    annually. the students attend a lecture and a 2 hour supervised
    laboratory session each week. the lectures are structured to
    give the students an overview of various aspects of the
    computer-based information profession. the laboratory sessions
    are of prime importance because throughout the course emphasis
    is placed on learning the systems by being on-line. each
    student has the use of a terminal during the laboratory
    session; and consequently is on-line a minimum of 30 hours per
    term.
