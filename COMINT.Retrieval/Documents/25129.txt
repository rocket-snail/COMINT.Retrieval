annual report of the association of diploma librarians in
    academic libraries 1980-1981. the year's most important event
    was the librarians' conference in wuppertal, may 80, on
    inter-library cooperation, work places for users and staff and
    new library techniques. there is as yet no improvement in the
    social position of librarians, wage negotiations having come to
    a temporary halt. analysis of questionnaires on staffing in
    academic libraries has been completed. the german library
    conference will consider the question of cooperation between
    the deutsche bibliotheksinstitut (german library institute) and
    the various librarianship organisations. librarians met with
    representatives from the booktrade to discuss changes in
    copyright law, the work of the deutsche bibliothek (german
    national library), odin and the publication of agreements
    between librarians and booksellers. minutes of the members'
    meeting in regensburg, june 81, are included.
