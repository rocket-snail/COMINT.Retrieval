fundamental problems of hf and if amplifiers for tv
    reception part noise noise factors of amplifiers operating
    under various specified conditions are calculated and valve
    noise is discussed formulae are derived for the noise factor at
    metre wavelengths for four special simplified cases a general
    formula being given in an appendix the concept of noise
    reference frequency the frequency the frequency at which the
    equivalent noise resistance of a valve is equal to the input
    resistance is discussed and formulae are tabulated for both
    triode and pentode circuits with predominating partition noise
    graphs of noise factor for various cases show that above the
    frequency the noise factor increases rapidly the signal noise
    ratio is calculated from the noise factor it appears that the
    weakest signal that can be received reasonably well depends on
    the frequency on the aerial noise and particularly on the noise
    reference frequency of the first valve of the receiver
