the physical interpretation of the self acceleration of
    electrons the forces governing the motion of electrons are most
    easily understood if the point electron is considered as the
    limiting case of the finite size electron for self acceleration
    to occur it is not essential that the field energy be infinite
    but it is important that the mechanical mass of the electron by
    negative
