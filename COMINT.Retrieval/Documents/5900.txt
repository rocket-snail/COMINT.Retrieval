observations on the ussr earth satellites and the study
    of radio wave propagation measurements of bearing angle of
    elevation and doppler frequency shift were made at and the
    observed phenomena could be explained in terms of existing
    knowledge of ionospheric propagation the derivation of orbital
    parameters from the observations is discussed
