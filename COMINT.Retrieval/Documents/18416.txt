pulse detector with an inductance capacitance filter an
    ideal detector with an lcr filter is considered taking into
    account the internal impedance of the current source a method
    is proposed for calculating the voltage at the load when
    detecting pulses of arbitrary shape and the necessary formulae
    are derived
