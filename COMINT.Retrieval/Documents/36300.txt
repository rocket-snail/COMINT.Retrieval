fluctuation magnetic after effect thesis based on neels
    theory on the irreversible after effect in ferromagnetic
    materials which is identified with the residual loss earlier
    reports of the work were noted in of and of in which it should
    have been stated that the square root of the remanent
    magnetization is proportional to the logarithm of time elapsed
    from the suppression of the field and to the logarithm of the
    duration of application
