experimental verification of the relationship between
    diffusion constant and mobility of electrons and holes short
    pulses of electrons or holes were injected into single crystal
    rods of p and n type ge as the pulse travelled along the rod
    under the influence of an electric field diffusion took place
    resulting in broadening of the pulse a large number of
    measurements of pulse widths and transit times for two
    positions of the emitter point were made and the most probable
    value of the ratio of diffusion constant to mobility was
    derived by the method o of least squares this was found to
    verify the relation see of
