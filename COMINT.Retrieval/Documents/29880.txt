    cataloging. speculates on directions for research in the field
    of bibliographical control, where bibliographical control is
    taken to include indexing, classification, and cataloguing. the
    position taken is that while concerns of a how-to-do-it nature

    developmental nature, there is a strong need for this research
    to be backed by basic theoretical research.
