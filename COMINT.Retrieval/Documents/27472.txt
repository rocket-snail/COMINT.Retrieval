a self indicating magnetic scaling system using electro
    deposited nickel iron film cores details are given of a
    magnetic decade scaling system in which direct count indication
    is obtained by using the external magnetic fields of the
    storage cores themselves with the electro deposition technique
    described the difficulty of getting sufficiently close coupling
    between the film and the associated driving and sense coils has
    been overcome
