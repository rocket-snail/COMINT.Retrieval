geomagnetic fluctuations and the form of the outer zone
    of the van allen radiation belt the suden compression of the
    geomagnetic field associated with the initial phase of a
    magnetic storm causes electrons to diffuse radially across the
    geomagnetic field it is estimated that a particle at will
