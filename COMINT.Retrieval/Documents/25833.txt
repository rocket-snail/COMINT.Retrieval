application of sociology, psychology and pedagogy to
    librarianship. the 1st and foremost task of librarians in
    bulgaria is to educate their readers and to exercise influence
    on their reading habits. to be capable of performing the job
    successfully, librarians must acquire a working knowledge of
    sociology, psychology and pedagogy. thus, they will not only
    see each reader as an individual with his/her own family and
    educational background, personal qualities, and professional
    requirements, but they will also be able to make the best of a
    leader's authority in a group. education of children and
    adolescents has benefitted from collaboration between teachers
    and librarians and the experience gained must now be used more
    fully in adult education. on the other hand, sociology,
    psychology and pedagogy must be applied to set criteria for the
    personality of a good librarian, library management and the
    methodological guidance of the rank and file library
    staff.
