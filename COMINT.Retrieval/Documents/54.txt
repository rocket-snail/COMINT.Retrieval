generalized appleton hartree equation for any degree of
    ionization and application t the ionosphere the equation
    derived is applicable to any variation of electron collision
    frequency with electron speed and any degree of ionization
    results for the ionosphere are compared with experimental data
    e layer results can be explained by assuming a electron
    temperature several times higher than the gas
