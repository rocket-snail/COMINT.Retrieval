refractive index of dipolar gas mixtures at decimetre
    wavelengths the refractive index of mixtures of air and water
    vapour was measured at frequencies from to over a range of
    pressures using a cavity resonator method results are shown in
    curves discrepancies between the observations and values
    predicted from theory are attributed to the fact that the
    relaxation time of the water molecules is not negligible at low
    pressures
