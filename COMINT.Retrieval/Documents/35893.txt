a general approach to hysteresis a alternative
    formulation of the domain model a comparison is made of various
    methods of formal representation of hysteresis phenomena in
    terms of a domain model a symmetrical treatment is developed
    permitting the equations to scanning curves within a hysteresis
    loop to be written in a simple form
