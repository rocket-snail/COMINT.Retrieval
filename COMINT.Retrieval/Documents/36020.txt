a proposal for a network computer for online assistance.
    recent research work on both microcomputers and mainframe
    machines has shown the potential for providing assistance to
    the user outside the host computer. the us microcomputer
    systems have concentrated on large scale systems with extensive
    tutorial facilities, such as the 01 sam system offered by the
    franklin institute, or format transformation systems for moving
    data from one system to another as provided by the cast system
    marketed by the computer corporation of america. the uk system,
    userkit, is a cheaper terminal attachment which simplifies
    logon by permanently stored messages, reduces search costs by
    pre-formulation of search statements and provides output
    selection and re-transmission facilities.
