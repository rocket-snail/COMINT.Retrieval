on the meridional distribution of the minimum virtual
    height of the f layer results of an analysis of daily
    variations in from observatories indicate the presence of two
    periodic terms the diurnal variation which is dependent on the
    geographic latitude and the semidiurnal variation which depends
    on the geomagnetic latitude the former may be considered as the
    thermal effect the latter as the tidal effect in the f
    region
