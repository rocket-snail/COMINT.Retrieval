information-processing models of cognition. reviews
    recent progress in modelling human cognitive processes.
    particular attention is paid to the use of computer programming
    languages as a formalism for modelling, and to computer
    simulation of the behaviour of the systems modelled. this
    article does not deal at all with neural models; it focusses
    mainly upon higher mental processes, but not without some
    attention to modelling the elementary processes and especially
    to the relationships between elementary and complex
    processes.
