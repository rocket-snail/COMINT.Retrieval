new resistor voltage coefficient tester the variation of
    resistance with applied voltage is determined from measurements
    of the third harmonic generated by the resistor on application
    of a sinusoidal voltage the basic circuit is described and some
    experimental results are given the measurements of resistor
    noise at is also briefly described
