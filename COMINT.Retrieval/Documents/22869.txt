winds and turbulent air currents in the ionosphere
    predominantly horizontal linear air currents have been observed
    by direct and indirect methods the most frequent velocity is at
    altitudes between and and in the f layer between and km
    nonuniformity of direction is observed the results indicate
    that wind direction and speed depend on time of day and on
    season as well as on latitude the observations confirmed that
    turbulent currents are superposed on the linear currents in the
    km region but yielded no corresponding information for the f
    layer the occurrence of solar and lunar tides in the e layer
    with velocity amplitudes of and respectively was confirmed
    observations at the greatest possible number of stations are
    required to enable further conclusions to be reached
