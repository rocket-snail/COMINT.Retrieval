journals read by acrl academic librarians, 1973 and 1978.
    a study was undertaken to identify the amount and kinds of
    professional journal reading being done by acrl (association of
    college and research libraries) academic librarians, with data
    drawn from 2 separate surveys made over a 5-year period of
    time. questionnaires were sent to a sample of acrl members in
    1973 and again in 1978, which ascertained how many journals
    they were reading regularly and what the titles of those
    journals were. illustrations provide a comparison of most
    frequently read titles for 1973 to 1978, with the percentage of
    reader response for each title. for both years surveyed, acrl
    academic librarians averaged approximately 7 journals read on a
    regular basis. a separate analysis of the 1978 data indicated
    that 7 of the titles cited as being read accounted for 80% of
    the journal reading. as had been the case in 1973, more than 9
    in 10 of these academic librarians were regular readers of
    college & research librar ies. however, several other
    titles heavily cited in 1973 lost readership among acrl members
    due to the dramatic appearance of the journal of academic
    librarianship.
