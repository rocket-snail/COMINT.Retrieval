the theory of ferromagnetic resonance at high signal
    powers it is shown that two anomalous effects in the microwave
    absorption of ferromagnets are connected with two kinds of
    instability of the uniform precessional motion of the total
    magnetization against certain spin wave disturbances the
    susceptibilities are calculated for the final state attained by
    the medium with high signal levels and are shown to agree with
    experiment
