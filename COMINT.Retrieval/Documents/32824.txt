the radio source near the galactic centre recent
    observations on with the cross aerial are discussed in relation
    to earlier observations on and the position of the dominant
    source is shown on a contour map of equivalent brightness
    temperatures alternative models accounting for the observations
    and involving adsorbing regions are mentioned whichever model
    is assumed the nucleus of stars in the galaxy is not itself
    detectable as a source
