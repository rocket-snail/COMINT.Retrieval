an analogue reciprocal function unit for use with pulsed
    signals a monostable multivibrator operates so that the width
    of the pulse generated is approximately inversely proportional
    to the peak voltage of an input pulse the pulse width variation
    is converted to a corresponding amplitude variation of sawtooth
    output pulses by means of a constant velocity timebase
