effective parameters in ferrimagnetic resonance the
    steady state solution for the susceptibility tensor of a two
    sublattice system has been found by using sublattice equations
    of motion which include complete landau lifschitz relaxation
    terms with individual relaxation parameters and which describe
    relaxation toward the instantaneous total field acting on the
    sublattice
