field dependence of magnetoconductivity a theoretical
    calculation is made of the dependence of the elements of the
    conductivity tensor on the magnetic field for the case of a
    crystal with arbitrary energy band structure the results are
    the same as would be given by a superposition of electron gases
    whose cyclotron frequencies are related harmonically the
    strengths of the harmonics depend on the band structure the
    diagonal of the conductivity tensor are monotonically
    decreasing functions of the magnetic field strength
