a system of measuring the dynamics of reading. the
    dynamics of reading can be defined as changes in reading habits
    produced as a result of social development. the last 15 years
    have seen much research in this field, but all has been related
    to specific times and locations. there is a growing need for a
    general framework of reference, and this paper attempts to
    review some of the methodological problems involved. one
    solution to the chief problem, that of measuring reading
    dynamics, was suggested by a research project at the lenin
    state library, which discerned 3 indicators of change;
    prevalence of reading, activeness and content.
