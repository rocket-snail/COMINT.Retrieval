a variable voltage stabilizer employing a cold cathode
    triode a circuit is described in which a cold cathode gas
    filled triode acts as a dc amplifier such an arrangement has
    desirable characteristics as a voltage stabilizer in low
    current circuits a portion of the output voltage of a source is
    compared with a reference voltage the difference being used to
    control the current through the parallel connected stabilizer
    valve so that the output voltage is maintained at a constant
    value
