application of an entropy measure for journal evaluation
    and its comparison to other quantitative measures. (phd
    thesis-case western reserve university, ohio). using a set of
    856 journals indexed in 1978 by 2index medicus1 and by the
    citing journal package of 2journal citation reports1, a new
    quantitative measure having a theoretical basis (entropy
    measure) was tested. the results were compared with those of 4
    other measures representing an empirical approach. all 5 sets
    of results were compared with core journal lists and a peer
    review ranking of some of the titles. the 5 measures seemed to
    represent different journal properties. the entropy measure
    involved the brillouin information measure (the contribution of
    a journal to the communication network related to a journal
    population). the journal selection process would benefit from
    the use of any of the 5 measures, even though they produce
    varying results.
