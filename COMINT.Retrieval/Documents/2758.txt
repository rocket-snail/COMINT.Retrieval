stability of oscillation in valve generators a
    comprehensive theory of stabilitys is developed which is
    applicable to a large class of harmonic oscillators the paper
    is concerned mainly with the terminal regenerative type of
    oscillator with grid leak bias but the analysis applies also to
    circuits with fixed grid bias and to terminal oscillators all
    known forms of instability appear as special cases of the
    general theory and some new forms are predicted stability is
    determined by the nature of the roots of a characteristic
    equation and stability criteria are obtained in the form of
    inequalities between the parameters of the amplifier and
    feedback network a modified form of nyquist locus diagram can
    also be used when the feedback network is symmetrical with
    respect to the oscillation frequency the characteristic
    equation can be factorized to give independent criteria for
    frequency and amplitude stability hysteresis effects and
    periodic instability are analysed in detail in addition to the
    general treatment specific forms of the various parameters
    which appear in the stability criteria are worked out for a
    three halves law amplifier with a semi linear or exponential
    grid current characteristic quantitative experimental
    confirmation is provided
