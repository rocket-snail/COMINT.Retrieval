determination of the direction of arrival and the
    polarization of whistling atmospherics measurements have ben
    made at using two pairs of identical aerials located at the
    ends of perpendicular base lines received signals were passed
    to a central measuring station via microwave links results show
    that the direction of arrival of the signal makes an angle of
    between and with the magnetic field polarization is consistent
    with the direction of arrival observed and leads to electron
    densities about ten times smaller than those given by storey
    of
