    philippines, aug 80. surveys interlending in the countries
    which comprise the consortium of national libraries and
    documentation centres, south-east asia-indonesia, malaysia, the
    philippines, singapore and thailand. a questionnaire survey
    revealed that the volume of interlending varied greatly between
    these countries and was generally low. many more interlibrary
    loan requests were sent abroad than were received. only a few
    libraries had telephone and telex links, but many had
    reprographic equipment. requests were sent mainly to subject
    specialist libraries, and union catalogues and central
    collections were less used. charges were minimal. stresses the
    importance of maintaining national and international
    statistics. this is 1 function of national interlending
    centres, which should be established as independent units in
    all coun tries.
