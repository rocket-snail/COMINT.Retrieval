on charging for information services. comments on a
    report by the delegation for scientific and technical
    information provision' 2information at any price' on charging
    for information services1, in which it is suggested that
    interlending from scientific libraries should be charged at a
    standard rate per loan, despite the fact that charging for
    traditional library services was excluded from the commission's
    remit. 1 reason for considering charges nonetheless is the
    increasing scope and cost of interlending. another is the
    change in the budgeting of institutions for tertiary education
    which has transferred library allocations from the state to the
    institutions; these are tempted to achieve savings through
    charges on interlending. the report regards interlending of
    little importance to public libraries. it does not attempt to
    calculate the cost of interlending, nor the cost of
    administering a system of charges.
