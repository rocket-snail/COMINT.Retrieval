on the influence of electron ion diffusion exerted upon
    the formation of the layer the maximum electron density of the
    layer and its height are obtained theoretically as functions of
    latitude and solar zenith distance the theoretical height
    distributions derived are thinner than chapman distributions
    and the effective recombination coefficient decreases with
    height at low altitudes but becomes constant at high altitudes
    no better agreement between theory and observation is obtained
    when a vertical electron ion drift velocity is considered see
