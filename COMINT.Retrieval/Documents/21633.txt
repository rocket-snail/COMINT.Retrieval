librarianship and information work' job characteristics
    and staffing needs. results of the administration of a
    job-description questionnaire to members of staff in a
    representative 5% sample of libraries and information units are
    reported. the form of job description, covering the
    intellectual, social, and physical demands of the work and work
    environment, enables the personnel requirements for the jobs to
    be inferred fairly directly. an assessment is made of the
    degree to which existing personnel meet the demands of their
    jobs. the way in which library and information work is
    changing, and the roles of men and women; and of graduates are
    discussed. a job classification based on cluster analysis
    techniques is also attempted.
