consumer health information needs and access through
    existing indexes. a solution to the demand for consumer health
    information in public libraries is proposed; use of materials
    already in most collections and accessible through popular
    journal indexes such as 2readers' guide1 and 2magazine index1.
    the results of a study of the responsiveness of the 2 indexes
    to patrons' requests for health-related information in 1 public
    library are presented along with a cost analysis of the
    method.
