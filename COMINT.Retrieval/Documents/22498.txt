studies in magneto hydrodynamics a systematic treatment
    of the subject designed to bring out the underlying physical
    principles basic equations for em phenomena in a conducting
    liquid and their conditions of validity are discussed these are
    applied in specific static kinematic and dynamic problems
    experimental work is briefly summarized
