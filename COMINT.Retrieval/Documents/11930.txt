the non-departmental library. describes an experiment
    with a department common to adults and children in the new
    library in emmaboda, opened in autumn 80. the shape of the new
    library made it difficult to divide it into departments and the
    possibility of savings in acquisition of material suitable for
    both adults and children, or for young people on the borderline
    of adulthood persuaded the library to try to integrate the
    material. the library is divided into fiction and non-fiction,
    with non-fiction books for children placed after those for
    adults on the same shelf; adult fiction and children's fiction
    have their own shelves, but in the same place in the hall. an
    area in connection with the issue desk contains periodicals and
    picture books with seating for all ages, including headphones
    for children. after a year the experience has proved entirely
    positive.
