new developments in information technology for
    interlingual communication. paper presented at the aslib
    technical translation group conference, london, 20 nov 80. with
    closer economic cooperation worldwide and increasing numbers of
    international organisations and meetings the cost of
    translation and interpreting services may become too heavy a
    burden unless solutions for reducing costs can be found. there
    is a danger of introducing new barriers into interlingual
    communication resulting from the requirements of the new
    technology itself such as documentation and command languages.
    describes the european commission's attempts to overcome these
    barriers. standardisation agreements are urgently required
    among manufacturers of hardware, designers of software, hosts
    of data bases and producers of translations and terminology.
    briefly outlines new forms of translation that will be
    available.
