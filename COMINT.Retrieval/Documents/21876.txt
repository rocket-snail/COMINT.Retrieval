thermally compensated crystal oscillators frequency
    stability is achieved by using thermistors in a temperature
    sensitive phase shifting network incorporated in the oscillator
    circuit a stability of about in is obtained over a wide
    frequency range without thermostats or ovens it is suggested
    that even better compensation would be achieved by attaching
    the thermistor bead to the crystal
