the theory and design of cathode follower output stages
    limitations imposed on the design of cathode follower stages
    feeding loads with an earthy a end are noted procedures are
    outlined for choice of valve for a particular service and then
    completing the circuit design under the conditions that the
    specified maximum anode current and anode dissipation are not
    exceeded and that linear operation is achieved
