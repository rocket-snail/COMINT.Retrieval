ten pulse amplitude discriminator a pulse height
    discriminator has been developed which is capable of operating
    at repetition rates up to it accepts positive input pulses with
    a threshold adjustable from to the output signal is of constant
    shape and amplitude the circuit is described and test results
    are given
