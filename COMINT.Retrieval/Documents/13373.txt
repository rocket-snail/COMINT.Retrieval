theoretical world curves of maximum f ionization part a
    time dependent solution of the continuity equation including
    vertical diffusion of ionization is used to obtain a
    theoretical variation of maximum f layer electron density with
    latitude and local time some similarity to experimental data is
    found but the equatorial trough does not occur in the
    theoretical solution see also of
