a general purpose electromagnet details are given of a
    magnet for laboratory purposes with a soft iron yoke having low
    residual magnetism and poles of diameter together with a table
    showing the variation of the field in the centre of the gap
    with excitation and gap length distribution of radio stars a
    tentative explanation is given of discrepancies between the
    distribution derived by ryle from interferometer measurements
    at and that derived by pawsey from mills cross measurements
    also at as discussed at the recent jodrell bank
    symposium
