libraries in a society of pictorial abundance' do they
    honour their responsibility?. paper given at the swedish
    library association's annual meeting. describes technical
    developments in the video field, which are likely to lead to an
    abundance of pictures competing on our tv screens. this
    situation has both problems and possibilities. the output of
    video cassettes consists mainly of low quality action films and
    the delay in the plans for distribution of swedish tv
    programmes, which should heighten the quality, is regrettable.
    but the new distribution system also offers new freedom of
    choice and independence of transmission times. video techniques
    are useful for minorities such as the deaf and immigrants. the
    videogram commission therefore recommends that libraries should
    show video films, lend them and transmit them via cable.
