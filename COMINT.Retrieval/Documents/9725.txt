to read with the aid of technology. examines various
    technical aids to reading, most of them available free to users
    through the regional aid centres. a reading corner for
    partially sighted should be arranged in every library, using
    correct tables and lighting. aids for enlarging images may be
    'passive' aids which only enlarge, such as binoculars, lenses
    and magnifying glasses, or 'active', such as magnivision. the
    latter is a closed circuit tv system by means of which the user
    can enlarge the text and improve the image in various ways.
    systems which enable reading by means other than seeing include
    braille; talking books on tape; optacon, a machine which
    transfers letters to vibrating points; the kurzweil reading
    machine, which produces synthetic speech from a printed text,
    at present using english language only. other aids are devices
    for turning pages and prism glass eyes for those immobile in a
    horizontal position.
