observations on reader behaviour in a college of
    technology library. the 10 college of technology libraries in
    north rhine westphalia have a total stock of 850,000 items for
    over 50,000 students and 2,000 teachers; in 1980-81 their
    library budgets amounted to more than 3 million dm. loans have
    risen steadily since 1974 owing to larger book stocks, longer
    opening hours, more instruction for students in the use of
    subject literature and the development of interlibrary loan
    schemes. in contrast with the universities, the majority of
    demands for external material came from students, especially
    examination candidates, rather than from teachers. the ordering
    of monographs is increasing but periodicals are the type of
    literature most in demand. it is vital that all college of
    technology libraries should have access to national interloan
    schemes.
