a method of estimating ionospheric absorption heights
    from recovery times rapid recovery from absorption occurs when
    the ionizing source is suddenly cut off from a plot of
    ionospheric relaxation time against height an estimate can be
    made of the height of the absorbing layer which is in good
    agreement with measurements made by the three frequency
    riometer method
