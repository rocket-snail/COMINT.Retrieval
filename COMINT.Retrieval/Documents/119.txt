are county libraries threatened?. the norwegian
    government report nou 1979 proposes that from 1981 state grants
    towards county administration should cease, being replaced by
    additional tax income. the intention is to simplify local
    government financial structure and increase the counties'
    administrative responsibility and autonomy. concentrating on
    technical details, the report ignores their effect on
    professions and employment in the areas concerned. cultural
    work is defined as a voluntary activity for counties, not
    requiring or meriting state support; libraries are considered
    to be already under some degree of state supervision. state
    support has been a stimulus to cultural life in rural areas,
    and its removal would be a retrograde step. the proposals, if
    implemented without further clarification of laws, regulations
    and areas of responsibility, could lead to greatly varying
    standards of library service in individual counties, also
    affecting schools and adult education. this would be di rectly
    counter to the 'equality principle' in the current library
    act.
