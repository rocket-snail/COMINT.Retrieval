the effect of the initial phase of a magnetic storm upon
    the outer van allen belt a theoretical study of the motion of a
    charged particle trappin a magnetic dipole field and in a
    compressed dipole field the latitude shift of the trapped
    radiation during magnetic storms is found to be small
