classification and subject indication' highlights of the
    anglo-american debate, 1850-1950. discusses the development of
    uk and us ideas on subject headings and classification from the
    time of panizzi's challenge to classified cataloguing through
    the practical approach of cutter and hulme to the work of
    bliss. cutter and hulme never fully developed their practical
    approach, leaving the way clear for the theoretical
    classificationists such as otlet and richardson. universal
    decimal classification was the manifestation of their
    principles and also the beginning of a decisive historical
    movement that culminates in the work of bliss. his great value
    is that he offers an independent perspective on the history of
    classification and subject indication and is reasonably
    encouraging about colon classification, the system that ended
    the formative classificationist period in anglo-american
    thought.
