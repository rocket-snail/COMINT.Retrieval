radio echoes observed during aurorae and terrestrial
    magnetic storms using and waves simultaneously a report of
    observations at tromso near the auroral zone and at kjeller
    near oslo the two pulse transmitters at each station had common
    pulse modulators so that the shape and energy of the pulses
    could be made identical the peak pulse power was and repetition
    frequency sec echoes on appeared regularly at tromso during
    auroral displays and in a number of cases also on study of the
    results led to the conclusion that the echoes were not due to
    direct scatter from the ionosphere but could be explained by
    reflection of backwards scatter from land or see via the e
    layer the ionization of which increases greatly during aurorae
    and geomagnetic storms in all cases the echoes on showed a x
    smaller range than those on the difference in range usually
    exceeding km differences between the echo patterns on the two
    frequencies are noted a full account of the observations will
    be given in
