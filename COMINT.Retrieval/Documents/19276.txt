low audio frequency electromagnetic signals of natural
    origin signals in the frequency range have been recorded in
    california over long periods the diurnal variation of signal
    amplitude closely resembles the diurnal variation of
    atmospheric potential gradients measured at sea it is inferred
    that these low frequency signals are atmospherics and that
    their mean amplitude is roughly proportional to the number of
    storms in progress over the whole world
