recent developments in telecommunications and their
    impact on information services. following a reminder of what
    telecommunication involves, the features and characteristics of
    various transmission media are reviewed. these comprise wire or
    cable media both metallic (twisted pairs and coaxial cable) and
    nonmetallic (optical fibres) as well as free space propagation
    methods such as tv broadcasting and microwave radio. also
    discusses the techniques in networking using these media and
    describes systems and services which, in their evolution are
    making use of the new developments in telecommunications. these
    include videotex, teletext, catv, the electronic directory,
    electronic mail and messaging, teleconferencing and
    telewriting, facsimile, networks and data base handling. the
    impact these new developments, both technologies and resulting
    systems, are having on information services is examined from
    the point of view of user reactions, benefits, problems and
    effects. stresses that information services have become much
    broader in scope than has hitherto been understood by
    traditional library and information services and they now
    include services prepared specifically for the domestic and
    business markets.
