office communications automated in sweden. philips of the
    netherlands has delivered the 1st of 30 dsx-40 switching
    systems to the swedish telecommunications administration. the
    dsx-40 is an 'office communications controller', i.e. a
    communications computer for telex, text, and data traffic.
    sweden has decided to install the system as part of its plans
    for the automated office of the future. initially, the dsx-40
    will be used to automate telex procedures which have been
    performed manually in the past. for the future, the system
    could function as the electronic postman in a non-voice
    inter-office network.
