information and documentation' an underdeveloped area in
    the world of education. creative activities are currently
    fashionable; in information and documentation they have
    produced a vast quantity of literature, most of which must
    ultimately be discarded for financial reasons. nevertheless
    these activities are necessary because each student and
    researcher should offer his ideas to his colleagues for
    examination; scientific problems touch on several disciplines
    and so require multilateral planning; and neglecting to study
    current international literature can prove costly or can result
    in vague, utopian projects. young scientists and engineers must
    devote time to literature study; training at university level
    and in the factory or research centre is needed. official
    documentation centres must be user-oriented.
