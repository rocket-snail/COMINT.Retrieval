synchronization of frequency modulated free running
    oscillators investigated by servomechanism methods application
    of a servo system to the control of a free running oscillator a
    method is described for determining the frequency response of
    the closed loop from measurements of open loop characteristics
    quadripole correctors for improving the response will also
    widen the frequency range over which control may be
    exercised
