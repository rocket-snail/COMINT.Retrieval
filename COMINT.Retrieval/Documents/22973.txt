a glance across the rhine' the french central lending
    libraries. the 76 french central lending libraries, comparable
    with the german state library centres, are administered by the
    ministry of culture and communication. each library contains a
    garage for the mobile libraries, book stores, offices and
    multi-purpose rooms for committee meetings, conferences and
    staff training sessions. large book stocks averaging 300,000
    volumes lead to space shortages. staff include both state
    employees and volunteers. help for culturally underprivileged
    areas is provided by' direct loan to the public from mobile
    libraries; deposit loan in factories, schools, youth clubs,
    holiday resorts and old people's homes; organisation of
    book-oriented activities. the central lending libraries' work
    reflects the current tendency toward decentralisation.
