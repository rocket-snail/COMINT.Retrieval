evidence of low frequency hydromagnetic waves in the
    exosphere damped waves with periods of several minutes are
    found in the auroral zones since their polarization is
    essentially elliptical they are interpreted as low frequency
    hydromagnetic waves propagated along the magnetic lines of
    force
