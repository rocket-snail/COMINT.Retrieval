a bista able element suitable for use in digital
    computers parts the development of a trigger c ircui using pnp
    and npn transistors is described switch on and switch off times
    of are achieved with a high current carrying capacity enabling
    several other circuits to be driven from it th transient
    response of the circuit to a voltage rap input at either the
    turn on or turn off terminals is analysed mathematically the
    results thus obtained assuming certain operating conditions
    show good agreement with experimental observations a decimal
    adder using a stored additional table a description of a serial
    decimal adder which accepts numbers in binary coded form the
    binary digits are decoded into a set of pulses which actuate a
    built in addition table storing all the po sible sums
