library work with foreign workers and their families in
    hamburg public libraries. in hamburg live about 145,000
    foreigners, mainly from turkey, yugoslavia, portugal, italy,
    greece and spain. one librarian is responsible for the 25,000
    books, tapes, newspapers and periodicals in 6 different
    languages provided on an annual budget of 200,000 dm in the
    central library and in branches serving areas with a large
    immigrant population. the main stock emphasis so far has been
    on fiction for adults and children; non-fiction stocks in
    foreign languages will now be expanded since information in
    them is not always available in german texts. it is often
    difficult to obtain information about foreign book markets and
    germans know little about the works themselves since few
    translations are available. it is important to recognise the
    cultural identity of foreign residents and to help them
    integrate successfully into west german society.
