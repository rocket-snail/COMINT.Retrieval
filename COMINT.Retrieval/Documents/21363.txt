boston public library: balancing the books. outlines the
    history and development of boston public library and its rich
    collections; describes the financial pressures now acting on it
    (the budget submitted in spring 80 was cut from $11.3 million
    to $9.3 million and a further cut of 35% is rumoured); outlines
    the resultant damage to services (bookmobile service,
    multilingual library, and hospital library service units all
    closed; opening hours everywhere severely curtailed); and
    discusses the actions of the director and the mayor of boston
    (who has been accused of making library trustee appointments on
    political grounds rather than by merit).
