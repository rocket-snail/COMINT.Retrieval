patron approaches to serials' a user study. although many
    catalogue use studies have been reported, those limited to
    patron success with locating serials have been uncommon. this
    study, conducted at a separate serial card catalogue in a major
    research library, measures the success of more than 400 patrons
    in the bibliographic retrieval of serials. the authors
    interviewed patrons and then analyzed the data in an attempt to
    determine how patrons approach a card catalogue when searching
    for serials, their success rate, and reasons for their
    successes and failures.
