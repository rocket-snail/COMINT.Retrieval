constant current audio power amplifiers the design
    features are discussed of a push pull amplifier using a pair of
    type valves in the output stage to feed a general radio type
    toroidal output transformer constant current operation of the
    output stage with resistors in the cathode leads for dc
    degeneration minimizes variations due to valve aging or
    replacement full circuit details of the amplifier and its
    simple power supply unit are given
