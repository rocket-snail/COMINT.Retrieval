first, do no harm' giving advice about
    photo-conservation. in 1979 in the usa, over 10 billion
    exposures were made by 45 billion cameras, but most of these
    photographs will eventually be lost, thrown away, self-destruct
    or be forgotten before anyone even thinks of preserving them
    for posterity. many institutions have already amassed too many
    photographs, and so perhaps preservation must be carried out by
    the photographs' originators. only now is some effort being
    made to establish programmes for the formal training of
    conservators, and most amateurs still want cheap, quick and
    easy solutions. it falls to librarians, archivists and
    curators, therefore to make useful information readily
    available to those who ask for it and to be prepared to carry
    it to those who do not. presents a list of useful and recent
    source materials on photo-conservation. if public consciousness
    can be raised enough to seek and follow the advice given by
    professionals, much of the usa's photographic heritage can be s
    aved.
