impedances of the electrolytical rectifier the impedance
    characteristic of an electrolyte rectifier is investigated
    experimentally a method for calculating an equivalent circuit
    of the oxide layer from the frequency dependence of its
    impedance is described it is concluded that rectification
    occurs by means of contact between p type and n type
    semiconducting layers
