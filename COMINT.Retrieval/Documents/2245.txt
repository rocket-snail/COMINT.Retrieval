diffraction by an edge and by a corner conditions are
    given which are sufficient to ensure that the current density
    normal to an edge is zero at the edge and that there is no line
    distribution of charge on the edge an extra condition is given
    which makes the components of the field parallel to the edge
    finite the solution is then shown to be unique simpler
    conditions are given for two dimensional fields the agreement
    of various known solutions with the conditions here determined
    is discussed certain simple types of current and charge
    distribution lead to a unique solution for the diffraction by
    corners formed by flat surfaces
