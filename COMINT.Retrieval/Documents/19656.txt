the exploitation of audiovisual materials in polytechnic
    libraries' a comparative study of the use of audiovisual
    materials. (mlib dissertation.) examines the exploitation of
    audio-visual materials in the libraries of 4
    polytechnics-brighton, newcastle, plymouth and thames. 3 main
    elements are investigated-administration, availability, and
    means of exploitation. brighton approaches the ideal situation;
    newcastle fully integrates the materials, but location of some
    equipment affects their use; plymouth's user education
    programme aids exploitation of the collection; and thames has
    too little space and an inadequate collection, reflecting the
    lack of a wholehearted approach to audio-visual
    provision.
