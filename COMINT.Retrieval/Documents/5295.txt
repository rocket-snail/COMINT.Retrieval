oclc-an american information system on its way to
    denmark. library automation began in 1965 with the first marc
    pilot project initiated by the library of congress and soon
    taken up by the british national bibliography. international
    standards have been drawn up to secure worldwide use of the
    system, culminating in the attempt to create universal
    bibliographic control. however, exchange of international
    bibliographic data has been beset by problems, so that
    international use of machine readable information is not very
    widespread. the use of international, english language based
    standards and exchange of actual tape have caused problems in
    scandinavia. for these reasons bibliographic service centres,
    'utilities', have been set up in usa and england, an idea which
    is also behind the danish systems samkat and biblioteksdata.
    the largest is the us oclc, which began in 1967. its main task
    is development of a bibliographic data base and decentralised
    cataloguing, which supplies the base with 60, 000 titles
    annually from 4,000 terminals. it also operates an interlending
    system, and hopes to add accessions and issue control systems
    to the services. the main product is catalogue cards. with the
    establishment of 'oclc europe', danish libraries will have to
    take a stand for or against cooperation with it.
