anomalous skin effect in ferromagnetics a brief
    mathematical analysis of the anomalous skin effect which is
    present in ferromagnetic materials at resonance at low
    temperature and at high frequencies when the depth of the skin
    layer is of the order of the length of a free path of the
    conduction electrons
