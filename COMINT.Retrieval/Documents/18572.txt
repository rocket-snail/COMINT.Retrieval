project echo antenna steering system the use of basic
    orbital information to generate aerial steering instructions
    for project echo is discussed a digital method is described in
    which predicted pointing data is transmitted by teletype to the
    aerial site then stored and subsequently used when required in
    real time to control the aerial drive mechanism
