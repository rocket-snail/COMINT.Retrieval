electromagnetic energy transfer methods of calculating
    and measuring the flow of electromagnetic energy are compared
    and contrasted the differences between the low frequency and
    high frequency approaches to energy flow problems are discussed
    and suggestions are made to ease the difficulties in the way of
    students and teachers faced with these apparently
    irreconcilable differences
