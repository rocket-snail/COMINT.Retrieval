parameters of readers' activity-a survey. during 1977 and
    78 a survey was carried out into the reading habits of the
    population of slovakia. the survey covered a number of
    parameters such as the number of books read during a 4 months
    period in private libraries, the frequency of public and trade
    union library visits and others. numerical results of the
    survey are broken down and related to the socio-economic
    structure of the population, educational level, job content and
    urban or rural domicile. as an activity, reading lags behind tv
    viewing on workdays and restdays and behind tv and 3 other
    activities on annual holidays for most people. the librarians'
    best friend is the reader who spends over 3 hours weekly
    reading, reads more than 10 books annually, possesses at least
    50 books and visits a public library more than 3 times a
    year.
