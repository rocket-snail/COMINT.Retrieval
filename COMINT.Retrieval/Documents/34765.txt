library development in nigeria' part ii later
    developments. part ii of a 2-part article on the development of
    librarianship in nigeria based on a paper presented to the
    library association of singapore, 22 sept 78. the 1st library
    school was set up at ibadan university in 1959 with a carnegie
    corporation grant. with the opening of other schools it is now
    possible to train most of the library personnel needed within
    nigeria. besides legislations for the national library, some
    state governments have passed laws for establishing library
    services. library provision is still uneven in nigeria;
    academic libraries have the best services and collections and
    there are many notable special libraries but the public library
    services are improving, especially in states with library
    legislation.
