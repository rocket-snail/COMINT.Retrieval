an integrated proficiency approach to pre-professional
    librarianship training. taking as a starting point the american
    library association committee on accreditation's list of
    essential requirements for all librarians, presents a detailed
    itemisation of the minimum professional skills essential for a
    pre-service librarian, structured in 6 principle divisions,
    covering understanding of' the development and communication of
    human knowledge; libraries and library science; collection
    building; organisation of library materials; library services;
    and management techniques. applications of this analytical
    prescription in planning and evaluating curricula are
    suggested, which would ensure inclusion of all essential
    philosophical and theoretical components in training
    programmes.
