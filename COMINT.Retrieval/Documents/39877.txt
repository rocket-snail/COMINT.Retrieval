transient conditions by transformation of the fourier
    integrals to obtain a series development of bessel functions
    expressions have been derived for certain transient response
    characteristics these included the response of a low pass and a
    high pass lc ladder filter and of a homogeneous transmission
    line to unit step and sinusoidal voltage input when the system
    is terminated by its image impedance
