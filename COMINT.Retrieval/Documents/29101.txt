the anomalous skin effect measurements were made on a
    number of metals at frequencies of and at temperatures in the
    range the variation of rf surface conductance with dc
    conductivity agrees well with the theoretical prediction of
    reuter and sondheimer of assuming that the electrons are
    scattered diffusely when they hit the surface of the metal the
    results are used to estimate the effective value of mean free
    path of electrons the estimate for cu agrees well with that
    based on theory but those for ag and au are rather lower than
    the theoretical values the results are largely dependent on the
    surface condition of the metal the use of the two different
    frequencies enables the influence of this factor to be
    assessed
