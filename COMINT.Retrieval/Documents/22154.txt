    at the 4th finnish-soviet seminar on the role of interlibrary
    loans in the provision of information services to science and
    industry, held 23-24 apr 79. interlibrary lending system in
    finland comprises a network of research libraries as well as
    some 50% of public libraries. regional libraries have the role
    of interlending centres; the helsinki city library has the
    function of the national centre. organisation of the system is
    described. although there are not, so far, any fixed procedures
    the regional centres act as intermediaries between the public
    and the research libraries. in its role of the finnish
    bibliographical centre the helsinki university library
    publishes the union catalogue of foreign publications. the
    library has the fullest collection, outside the ussr, of
    russian 1820-1917 imprints due to its legal deposit rights to
    russian publications in this period. statistics are given of
    loans from this collection.
