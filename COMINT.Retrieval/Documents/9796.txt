colleges of higher education in england and wales' three
    views. describes briefly the reorganisation of teacher training
    which took place in the uk during the 1970s, and discusses its
    effects on college libraries. considers some aspects of recent
    library development in the new colleges of higher education,
    including the growth of multi media services, and the grouping
    of all learning resources into one department. outlines the
    services and facilities provided by the learning resource
    centres of american community colleges, which it is suggested,
    can be compared to british colleges of further and higher
    education. argues that the conditions are right for colleges of
    higher education that so choose, to follow the american
    community colleges in their investment in learning resources
    for group and individual study.
