step to frequency response transforms for linear servo
    systems five known methods for finding frequency response from
    a given graph of linear mode step response are discussed theory
    and practical computing routines are given for a new method
    based on straight line segment approximation to the given step
    response graph approximate laws relating cut off frequency and
    frequency and amplitude of maximum response to the shape and
    and time scale of the step response are derived discrepancies
    between experimental results and those derived from the theory
    are ascribed mainly to nonlinearity of practical systems
