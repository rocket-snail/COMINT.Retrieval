some reactions occurring in the earths upper atmosphere
    the photo chemical reactions determining the equilibrium
    between n n no and no are examined the origin of the no in the
    atmosphere is discussed a considerable yield is necessary to
    balance the loss due to photodissociation this gas may be
    formed in the troposphere by collisions between o or o and
