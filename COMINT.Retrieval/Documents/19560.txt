devsis: a philosophy of documentation and information. in
    the absence of the interests which led to the establishment of
    systems such as medlars or inis, it is essential for african
    countries to coordinate their documentary resources for the
    development of their least favoured people. african devsis will
    form part of international devis. it is envisaged that the
    coordinating centre will have a small, highly qualified staff
    and emphasis will be placed on promoting national centres. the
    paper is followed by a discussion by john woolston outlining
    the genesis of devsis and various experiments and grass-roots
    initiatives which are taking place along devsis lines. the
    general assembly of the un has yet to discuss general adoption
    of the programme.
