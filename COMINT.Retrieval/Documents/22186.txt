about the building model for county libraries. describes
    the building model for hungarian county libraries, starting
    from the fact that such libraries do not meet only the demands
    of the county but also the requirements of the people living in
    the county seat (large city). deals with the area system of
    libraries, with their interconnections, paying special
    attention to the users' demands. suggests that the desired
    order of magnitude for county libraries exceeds the proposals
    of the respecting planning prescriptions and-depending on local
    conditions-it lies between 4500 sq. m. and 8-10,000 sq.
    m.
