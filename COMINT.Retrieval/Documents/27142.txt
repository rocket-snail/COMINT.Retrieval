the refractive index of water and aqueous solutions of
    sodium sulphate at metre wavelengths using the first method of
    drude the determination of the dependence of the refractive
    index of water on wavelength and temperature was extended to
    metre wavelengths and a temperature range from to similar
    investigations were also carried out to determine the
    dependence on concentration of the refractive index of s
    aqueous solutions of the main conclusions reached are the
    refractive in both cases increases linearly with temperature
    there is no anomalous dispersion at metre wavelengths for a
    given temperature the refractive index of a solution increases
    with concentration
