    contribution to a thematic issue on library use instruction.
    explains briefly the meaning of competency-based education-an
    educational approach which structures learning around
    competencies defined as fundamental for successful performance,
    and applies the concept to library user education. discusses
    the experiences of the following us educational institutions
    which are involved in competency based programmes' alverno
    college; doane college; sangamon state university; the
    university of louisville; findlay college; and the university
    of wisconsin-parkside. identifies some of the potential
    benefits that can be derived from adopting the competency based
    approach to library instruction, but recognises its
    limitations, and points out that it may be unsuitable for some
    institutions because it is too time consuming and
    demanding.
