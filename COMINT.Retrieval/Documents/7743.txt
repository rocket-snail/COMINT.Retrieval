statistical theory of kinetic phenomena general
    expressions are derived for kinetic coefficients which are used
    to obtain approximate formulae for the case of weak electron
    phonon inter action the derived formulae are used for
    investigating the thermoconductivity and thermo e m f of
    semiconductors
