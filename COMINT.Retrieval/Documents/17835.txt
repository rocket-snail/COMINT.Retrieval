future circuit aspects of solid state phenomena several
    phenomena such as superconductivity molecular amplification
    magnetic effects in semiconductors and the nonlinear
    capacitance of pn junctions are discussed from the point of
    view of the circuit designer new devices will to an increasing
    extent be based on controlled inhomogeneity
