systematic wind measurements at altitudes of km using
    radio echoes from meteor trails wind drifts of ionized meteor
    trails were measured using a coherent pulse doppler technique
    at a frequency of average wind speeds and directions were
    obtained over hourly intervals results for september and
    october show semidiurnal and diurnal wind components
    corresponding to a clockwise rotation of the wind vector the
    amplitudes and phases of these components are variable a
    prevailing wind was also found towards the east in september
    and towards the west in october there is a positive wind
    velocity gradient of sec between and height large
    irregularities in the wind were noted typical records are shown
    and the equipment is described
