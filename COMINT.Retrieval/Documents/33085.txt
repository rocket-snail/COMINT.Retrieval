the 3rd international meeting of experts from national
    libraries of socialist countries on acquisitions and
    international book exchange (budapest, 2-6 october 1979). the
    main topics discussed at the 3rd meeting were' the
    international exchange of publications and the design of a
    model of the copyright law. although a system of duplicates
    exchange has now been established and the exchange of
    microfilms has increased, 1 area of exchanges not yet
    functioning smoothly is official publications. a more unified
    approach will have to be developed before the system can become
    fully effective. the working group set up to investigate the
    position of the copyright deposit presented their
    recommendation to produce a model of the copyright deposit law
    for socialist countries as the model produced by the ifla's
    section on national libraries does not suit the conditions of
    multinational and federal countries and socialist countries in
    general.
