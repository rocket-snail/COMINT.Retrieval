use of the incoherent scatter technique to obtain
    ionospheric temperatures if the ionization above the f peak is
    in diffusive equilibrium its density decreases exponentially
    with height with a scale height proportional to the temperature
    of the neutral gas electron density profiles obtained by the
    incoherent scatter method at are consistent with a temperature
    of about between and
