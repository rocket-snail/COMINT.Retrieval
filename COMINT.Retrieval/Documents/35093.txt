text passage retrieval based on colon classification'
    retrieval performance. a set of experiments was conducted to
    determine the suitability of the colon classification as a
    foundation for the automated analysis, representation and
    retrieval of primary information from the full text of
    documents. full text data bases were created in 2 subject areas
    and queries solicited from specialists in each area. an
    automated full text indexing system, along with 4 automated
    passage retrieval systems, was created to test the various
    features of the colon classification. 2 boolean-based systems
    and 1 simple word occurrence system were created in order to
    compare the retrieval results against types of systems which
    are in more common use. the systems' retrieval performances
    were measured using recall and precision and the mean expected
    search length reduction factors. overall, colon-based systems
    did not perform significantly better than the other
    systems.
