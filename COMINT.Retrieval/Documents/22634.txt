the law of small variations in characteristics and its
    application to nonlinear and linear networks current changes
    resulting from small variations in characteristics in nonlinear
    dc networks can be calculated approximately by reference to an
    equivalent circuit examples of linear networks considered are a
    wheatstone bridge circuit and reactance two poles
