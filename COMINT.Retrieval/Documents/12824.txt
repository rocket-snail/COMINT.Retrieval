power spectrum of a nonlinear oscillator perturbed by
    noise analysis of the effect of background noise in producing
    amplitude fluctuations if the steady state of an oscillator is
    disturbed recovery takes place exponentially with a time
    constant which is the principal factor affecting the noise
    power spectrum simple relations between and the circuit
    parameters are derived which show that for minimum noise power
    oscillations of large amplitude should be used without
    introducing too many harmonics and the phase of the feedback
    should vary only slowly with frequency see also of april and
