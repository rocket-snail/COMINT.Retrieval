satellite observations of electrons artificially injected
    into the geomagnetic field the geomagnetically trapped
    electrons resulting from the high altitude nuclear detonations
    of the argus experiment have been observed on four radiation
    detectors in satellite explorer the measurements for several
    satellite passes through the argus shells are described and the
    significance of the results is summarized
