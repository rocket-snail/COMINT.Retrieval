electromagnetic momentum and elect on inertia in a
    current circuit the magnetic energy of a current circuit is
    identified with the kinetic energy of the mass equivalent of
    the total energy of the conduction electrons the concept of
    momentum in a current circuit is used to determine the force on
    the end wire of a long rectangular circuit and to bring the
    known effects of electron inertia in a circuit within the scope
    of theory an on off servomechanism with predicted change over a
    general method has been divised f r achieving optimum switching
    with an on off control system the practicability of predicting
    the ideal switching time has been demonstrated with a model
    experiment for wich responses to step ramp and parabolic input
    functions have been found to compare favourably with those of
    an orthodox system
