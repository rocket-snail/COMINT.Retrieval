libraries and censorship. translation of a paper
    presented at a 1979 brazilian library science conference
    describing the present situation in the usa, where although
    state censorship of library collections is minimal, the subject
    is 1 of great importance to practising librarians and in
    library schools. the activities of the american library
    association in establishing library and reader rights to
    freedom from intervention are described with particular
    reference to the 1948 library bill of rights and the mccarthy
    period. in conclusion, reference is made to the situation in
    brazil, where the official censorship has changed, and
    brazilian librarians warned to guard against any encroachments
    on library freedom.
