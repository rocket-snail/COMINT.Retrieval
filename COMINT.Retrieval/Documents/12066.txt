conservation in the library. during recent years there
    has been a growing concern over the physical condition of
    library collections. paper is brittle and crumbling, bindings
    are disintegrating, print is fading and covers are soft and
    spongy. unfortunately restoration is expensive and time
    consuming. discusses the destructive forces in the library and
    the many available solutions to prevent and control the
    problems. claims that conservation programmes are sometimes
    treated with apathy and resistance due to the philosophy of
    placing priorities on services. concludes that restoration work
    is best left to professional conservators while preventative
    measures can be instituted by dedicated librarians.
