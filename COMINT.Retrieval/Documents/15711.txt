heightening the scientific potential. heightening library
    effectiveness means improving the work of methodological
    centres, (mcs). library centralisation, 1974-80, was the great
    achievement of mcs and cultural agencies. in the 11th
    5-year-plan mcs must improve centralised library systems as a
    unified institution whose stocks can fulfil enhanced public
    demand. improvements are necessary in' librarians' and readers'
    bibliographic training; reference stock; formation of
    bookstocks; distribution of methodological publications; mc
    coordination. to assist scientific and technical progress a
    system of methodological aid to ussr libraries is needed. a
    document will shortly appear concerning progressive methods of
    work in libraries and mcs. coordination of mcs in the ussr
    library system aims for better results in methodological
    guidance for libraries.
