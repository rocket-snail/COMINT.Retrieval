investigation of the dependence of natural frequency of
    oscillation on spectral composition a particular case of the
    theory of nonlinear electric oscillations is considered writing
    the solution of the equation as the sum of is the amplitude of
    the harmonic given by the fourier series the ratio using this
    relation the dependence of on the amplitudes of the spectrum
    can be calculated the measured and calculated frequency
    characteristics of relaxation oscillators agreed well the
    results are presented graphically see also van der for general
    introduction
