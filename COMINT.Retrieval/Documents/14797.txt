collective electron ferromagnetism a generalization of
    the treatment and an analysis of experimental results a term
    involving the fourth power of the magnetization is introduced
    into stoners expression for the energy associated with
    magnetization if parameter values are suitably chosen the
    properties of ni show a high degree of co ordination and the
    magnetization temperature curves for ni co and ni cu alloys can
    be interpreted simply
