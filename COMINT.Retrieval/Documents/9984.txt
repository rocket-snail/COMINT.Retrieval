pressure effects of ionic currents in atmospheric air
    with various discharge configurations the mechanical pressures
    produced by steady and modulated ion currents were investigated
    theoretically for parallel plate concentric sphere and
    concentric cylinder electrode systems and experimentally for a
    point and plate system the agreement between theoretical and
    experimental results is good the investigation is of interest
    in relation to the ionic loudspeaker
