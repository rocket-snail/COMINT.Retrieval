give the part-time librarian a chance. a talk given to
    the association of part-time librarians, group c of the danish
    library association, at its 25 years' jubilee, oct 81, by a
    former chairman. when the association was formed in 1956, as an
    association of parish librarians, the position as part-time
    librarian was usually honorary and unpaid, a fact which caused
    lack of esteem for the job. there was little interest in
    membership and the association had to be financially supported
    by the group of parish library committees, the members'
    employers. hostility has been met from the librarians'
    association and later the librarians' union, unnecessarily, as
    the part-time librarians on the whole recognise the ultimate
    goal of full-time libraries staffed by professional librarians,
    but insist on satisfactory transitional arrangements. there
    should be a chance for part-time librarians through
    supplementary courses to qualify as librarians, and it is
    possible for the professionals and the non-profess ionals to
    work side by side.
