the adventures of reading and the role of the librarian.
    a translation from the original french of a paper by the
    directrix of the french joy through books programme, founded in
    1963 to develop children's libraries. discusses the importance
    of reading in relation to the proliferation of audio-visual
    media, from the viewpoints of both the recreational and
    informational advantages offered. in the library, the child is
    free to choose his own reading material, and it is here that
    the mediation of an adult is essential to ensure the young
    initiate is encouraged in his enthusiasms, in learning how to
    use and enjoy books, and in appreciating the relationship
    between reading and life. without the intervention of the
    librarian, the library can only be a distribution
    centre.
