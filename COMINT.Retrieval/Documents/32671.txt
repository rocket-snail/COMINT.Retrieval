electronic mail and its impact on europe. teletex and
    telemail are discussed as possible means of developing an
    electronic mail system. it is expected that electronic mail
    systems will grow rapidly. teletex will remain in the control
    of the ptis, however the price of a terminal is a major problem
    at the moment. a solution to this problem from france is
    briefly described. telemail in the uk is controlled by british
    telecom and at present offers a similar service to the telex
    system.
