fishers gyromagnetic effect observed in a body placed in
    a waveguide the component of magnetization produced in a
    ferrite perpendicular to the plane of a rotating magnetizing
    field may be detected in an ellipsoidal specimen placed in a
    waveguide excited in the h mode the theory and experiments
    which gave negative results were discussed by fisher on the
    effect can be used in determining magnetic fields at very high
    frequencies
