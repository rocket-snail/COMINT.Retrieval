a wide band frequency modulated system with asymmetrical
    phase oscillator an analytical investigation is made of the
    operation of the oscillator symmetrical and asymmetrical
    arrangements are compared as regards linearity of modulation
    modulation sensitivity and frequency stability in a
    system
