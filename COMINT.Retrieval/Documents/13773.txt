videotex research and development' the canadian context
    and contribution. identifies present research directions in
    videotex services, including research concerned with hardware
    and software, access to information, social and behavioural
    implications, and methodological and regulatory matters. the
    canadian telidon videotex system is generally perceived as a
    high-quality alternative to the uk serial alpha-mosaic and
    french parallel alpha-mosaic coding systems. intrinsic
    differences in the conceptual design of telidon have created a
    quite different communication medium. new directions for
    research and development (based upon a communication protocol
    independent of display, carrier, and content and capable of
    responding to a variable scale cost/quality continuum) provide
    opportunities for development significant to both public and
    private sectors of the economy.
