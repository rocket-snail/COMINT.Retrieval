the expansion of the rural library service in bavaria
    within the framework of the general development of bavarian
    libraries. lecture given at the 29th conference of state
    library centres in west germany, burghausen, sept 81. basic
    provision of stocks and staff is still not as good in rural as
    in urban areas; further financial provision from the state is
    necessary if library services are to be improved. plans for
    improving bavarian libraries are linked closely with national
    development schemes. every village with over 3,000 inhabitants
    has a branch library and smaller villages are served by mobile
    libraries, more of which are still needed. closure of many
    small branch libraries has resulted in a concentration of
    services and in increased stocks and readership. cooperation
    between public and school libraries and between local authority
    and church public libraries is very important.
