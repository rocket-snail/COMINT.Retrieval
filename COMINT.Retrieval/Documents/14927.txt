theory of electrostatic fields in the ionosphere at polar
    and middle geomagnetic latitudes analysis of the elongated es
    fields which provide the coupling in the dynamo motor concept
    of the e and f regions the es field is taken to be of arbitary
    horizontal scale and numerical solutions are determined for the
    attenuation of the field wi h a horizontal scale as small as or
    can extend from to height with a reduction of only about but
    the coupling efficiency is critically dependent on ionospheric
    conditions
