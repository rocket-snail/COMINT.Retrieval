documentation as a part of the syllabus at dutch library
    schools. the term 'documentation' was 1st used by paul otlet of
    the institut international de bibliographie in 1905. otlet
    regarded 'bibliography' as too restricted a term to cover his
    activities. with the increasing use of automated systems in
    libraries in the 1960s use of the term 'documentation' has
    become more frequently applied to certain tasks in all types of
    libraries. it is therefore unrealistic to consider
    librarianship and documentation as separate disciplines. at the
    frederik muller school of librarianship in amsterdam,
    documentation is taught as an integral part of the course for
    assistant librarians. the subject occupies 20% of the syllabus
    and includes subject indexing, information retrieval and
    abstracting techniques.
