authors and names' multiple pseudonyms in aacr2. the
    history of cataloguing pseudonyms is reviewed. aacr2 reverses a
    century-long cataloguing practice by allowing authors who use
    several pseudonyms to be entered in the catalogue under each
    name. this violates the catalogue's objectives as formulated by
    lubetzky and is contradictory to aacr2's own internal logic.
    the number of disadvantages to this rule far outweigh any
    advantages. it should be replaced.
