some design criteria for automatic controls the design of
    control systems to give optimum response is discussed in terms
    of the area between the graphical representation of a step
    disturbance and th control response curve this area and a
    weighted control area can be calculated directly from th system
    parameters and enable the necessary control sensitivies to be
    determined for optimum response
