breadth, specialisation and in-service training. reports
    on a meeting of the committee set up to revise the danish
    library school act. both the courses existing today, the one
    for public and the one for research librarians, have elements
    which should be retained in any future common foundation
    course. such a course should have the following elements'
    transfer of information and culture, its preconditions, forms
    and aim; education and research; internal organisation and
    administration; and skills and techniques. specialisation, if
    any, could take place within the individual projects or
    subsidiary courses. increase in the number of in-service
    courses was called for, financed by the reduction in the
    capacity of the school. the ministry of cultural affairs agrees
    to an organisational division into 2 sections' foundation
    course and further courses.
