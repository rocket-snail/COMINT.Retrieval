legal information in the usa. since the early 1970s, 2
    computer-assisted legal research systems have been commercially
    available in the usa, lexis and westlaw. in addition, the us
    department of justice has created the juris databank for the
    use of federal employees and the congress has made legis, which
    was compiled for use by its own staff, commercially available
    to outside users on a limited basis. all student lawyers in the
    us receive as part of their training a course on legal research
    and writing, involving the use of traditional and automated
    library systems. in future, therefore, it is likely that
    lawyers will expect a more comprehensive and up-to-date service
    from their libraries.
