solar eclipse of june and its effect upon the ionosphere
    the investigations at delhi reported include vertical incidence
    ionospheric measurements the recording of variations of sw and
    mf signals and the recording of solar noise on evidence of
    three distinct corpuscular eclipses was obtained both on the
    ionization density of the f layer and on the absorption in the
    nondeviating region these were found to occur and before the
    optical eclipse theoretical arguments and past observations
    indicate that these corpuscular emissions may have originated
    from the so called m region of the sun
