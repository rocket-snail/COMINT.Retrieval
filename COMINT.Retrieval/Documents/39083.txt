energy spectrum of electrons trapped in the geomagnetic
    field solutions of the fokker planck equation for th electron
    distribution function are obtained by reducing the equation to
    an eigenvalue problem the spectrum obtained with a source of
    decaying albedo neutrons is at variance with the observed
    result
