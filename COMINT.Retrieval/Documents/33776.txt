a practical method for constructing lr(k) processors a
    practical method for constructing lr(k) processors is
    developed. these processors are capable of recognizing and
    parsing an input during a single no-backup scan in a number of
    steps equal to the length of the input plus the number of steps
    in its derivation. the technique presented here is based on the
    original method described by knuth, but decreases both the
    effort required to construct the processor and the size of the
    processor produced. this procedure involves partitioning the
    given grammar into a number of smaller parts. if an lr(k)
    processor can be constructed for each part (using knuth's
    algorithm) and if certain conditions relating these individual
    processors are satisfied, then an lr(k) processor for the
    entire grammar can be constructed for them. using this
    procedure, an lr(1) parser for algol has been obtained.
