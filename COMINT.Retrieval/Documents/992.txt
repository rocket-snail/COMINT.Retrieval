    and information services, aslib, london, 16 mar 81. a
    theoretical discussion of the rationale behind library
    promotion, concentrating on public libraries. stresses the need

    communication technologies to keep one step ahead of social
    trends and expectations so that appropriate service responses

    the library created. describes how public libraries could
    develop their services to become institutions of contemporary
    relevance that are caring.
