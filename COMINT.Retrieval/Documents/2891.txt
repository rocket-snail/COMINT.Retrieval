the videogram report-published too late?. the videogram
    commission's report suggests that libraries should be
    distribution centres for a broad supply of good quality video
    recordings, but video has already become a mass market article
    supplied through international distribution channels and
    libraries have little chance of making an impact. a working
    group of representatives of cultural institutions, the
    vidmo-group, was formed already in 1973; it hoped to start
    experiments in libraries with production and showing of
    videograms, but trade union opposition meant that the swedish
    broadcasting corporation's programmes could not be used. other
    reports have appeared pointing to the advantages of libraries
    as distributors of video, but without state financial support
    public libraries will never be able to fulfil this role. some
    areas are, however, open to libraries, provided they cooperate
    with each other and other organisations' videograms for the
    deaf and other handicapped; videograms produced directly for
    the medium by artists and media workshops; videograms for
    children; for education in cooperation with the educational
    radio and the av centre; and locally produced material for
    video.
