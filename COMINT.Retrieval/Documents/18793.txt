the relation between standing wave ratio and bandwidth in
    wide band compensation of a reactance calculations are made for
    two different equivalent circuits representing a resistance
    accompanied by inherent reactance the swr obtained when the
    compensated resistance is connected to a loss free line with
    purely resistive characteristic impedance is used as a
    criterion of the compensation the results are expressed as
    irrational algebraic functions which are presented as bandwidth
    curves simple relations are derived between the permissible swr
    and the bandwidth
