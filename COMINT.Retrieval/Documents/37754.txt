distortion of arbitrarily shaped curves by rc sections a
    method is given of calculating the distortion by a rc network
    of any signal which is expressible as the sum of a power series
    and terms containing exponential functions of the circuit time
    constants tables and nomograms are given for calculating the
    output form given the input curve and vice versa for
    rectangular trapezoidal triangular parabolic and exponential
    type pulses
