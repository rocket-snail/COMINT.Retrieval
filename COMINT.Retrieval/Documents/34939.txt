ionospheric refraction of radio waves from radio stars an
    estimate of the total ionization of the f layer can be deduced
    from the refraction of radiation from radio stars caused by
    horizontal gradients of ionization occurring during normal
    diurnal variations in the layer interferometer measurements of
    the apparent positions of four radio stars are reported and the
    results are compared with calculated values based on
    ionospheric soundings agreement is found if certain plausible
    assumptions are made regarding the vertical distribution of
    electrons about the maximum concentration level of the f
    layer
