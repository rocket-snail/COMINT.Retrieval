scattering by a grating parts anomalies occur in the
    angular spectrum of plane waves scattered by a grating when any
    of the waves propagate tangentially along the surface this
    behaviour is analysed theoretically for a wave function
    vanishing on the grating elements and for the derivative of the
    wave function vanishing
