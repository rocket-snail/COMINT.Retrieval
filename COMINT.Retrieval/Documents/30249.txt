the absorption of electromagnetic waves in a wide
    frequency range by a thin homogeneous layer with losses the
    frequency bandwidth of absorbers using a single homogeneous
    lossy layer is investigated for conditions of vertical
    incidence with a very thin layer it is possible to achieve a
    frequency coverage over a range of
