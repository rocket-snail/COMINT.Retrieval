analysis and performance of locked oscillator frequency
    dividers employing nonlinear elements locked oscillator
    frequency dividers can be stabilized by inserting certain
    nonlinear elements in the oscillator circuits these elements
    should have a characteristic such that the voltage is
    proportional to an integral root of the current through them if
    this condition is satisfied the locked oscillator divider is
    almost completely insensitive to wide changes of anode voltage
    driving signal voltage and driving frequency the mathematical
    representation of the nonlinearity of the elements permits some
    analysis of the circuit nonlinear differential equations
    thyrite elements or varistors were used in experimental
    circuits for division by or
