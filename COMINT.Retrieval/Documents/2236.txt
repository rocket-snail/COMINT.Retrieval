an electronic phase shift tube for microwave frequencies
    the transmission of microwave radiation through an electron gas
    supported by a gas discharge plasma situated in a waveguide
    structure is discussed for the case in which the electron
    collision frequency is much less than the microwave frequency
    and an expression is derived for the phase shift arising from
    the change in guide wavelength a gas discharge phase shift tube
    has been developed on this principle and efficient action
    obtained by using the negative glow region of the discharge the
    performance of the tube is discussed in detail
