acquisition of homogeneous periodical literature in a
    specialist library' cost effectiveness. identifies the need to
    acquire literature in the interactive subjects of the central
    subject of research focus in a research organisation. gives a
    criterion to identify the interactive subjects and the methods
    to assign weights to these subjects relative to the central
    subject. these weightings determine the cut-off points in the
    ranked lists of these subjects. such a procedure would give
    rise to a homogeneous, cost effective periodical collection in
    a specialised research organisation.
