establishment of a new process of terrestrial
    demagnetization period of the latest demagnetization cycles
    recorded for our planet analysis of figures from observatories
    covering the whole world indicates oscillations in the
    intensity of the terrestrial magnetic field since an average
    period of years i is inferred for the remagnetization
    demagnetization cycles
