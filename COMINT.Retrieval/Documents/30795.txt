international symposium on fluid mechanics in the
    ionosphere review and verbatim report of the transactions of a
    symposium held in new york some of the papers presented are
    listed below others have been abstracted separately a
    constitution of the atmosphere at ionospheric levels b
    ionizations and drifts in the ionosphere c measurements of
    turbulence in the region from the radio echo observations of
    meteors d scattering of waves and microstructure of turbulence
    in the atmosphere e effect of a magnetic field on turbulence in
    an ionized gas f note on some observational characteristics of
    meteor radio echoes g on the spectrum of electron density
    produced by turbulence in the ionosphere in the presence of a
    magnetic field h evidence of elongated irregularities in the
    ionosphere i geomorphology of spread and characteristics of
    equatorial spread j an interpretation of certain ionospheric
    motions in terms of atmospheric k on the influence of the
    magnetic field on the character of turbulence in the ionosphere
    l magnetohydrodynamic of the small scale structure of the
    region m electrodynamic stability of a vertically drifting
    ionospheric layer n turbulent spectra in a stably stratified
    atmosphere o relation of turbulence theory to ionospheric
    scatter propagation experiments
