frequency modulation by inductance variation a frequency
    modulation by inductance variation a magnetically stable
    ferrite modulator the operation of modulators incorporating a
    reactance valve or a variable inductance is summarized the
    losses in the magnetic core of the inductance modulator are
    considerably reduced by using magnetic ferrites and details of
    this type of modulator are given it can be used in simple
    variable frequency circuits up to
