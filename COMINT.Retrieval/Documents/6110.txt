the chinese library and information scene' reflections on
    a visit to china in june 80. impressions gained during an
    official visit to china in june 80. china has a few very large
    libraries with strong collections and generous funding. many
    other libraries have serious gaps in their collections as a
    result of the cultural revolution. the emphasis is on academic
    and research libraries-there seem to be no public libraries.
    services are undeveloped, buildings and equipment are not of a
    high quality, there is no planned interlending system or
    library coordination, and most research is concerned with
    automation and information systems rather than librarianship.
    the chinese wish to solve their problems themselves, although
    they welcome help. the whole situation is in a state of rapid
    change and development.
