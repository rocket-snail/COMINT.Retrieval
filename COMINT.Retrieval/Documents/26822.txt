day to day and station to station correlation of
    ionospheric f region critical frequencies the correlation of
    simultaneous values at stations separated by in a north south
    direction is found to have a semi diurnal variation the phase
    of which varies with season results at a single station show an
    important autocorrelation for values at the same time on
    consecutive days and this is ascribed to magnetic
    effects
