the representation of the main geomagnetic field and of
    its secular variation by means of two eccentric dipoles a model
    comprising two dipoles is suggested to account for the second
    order terms in the expansion representing the geomagnetic
    potential the systematic displacement of the dipoles with time
    explains certain features of the geomagnetic secular variation
    the model provides a generally improved approximation to the
    actual surface geomagnetic field
