quantum effects in the interaction between electrons and
    high frequency fields the problem of determining at what
    frequency quantum mechanical effects become apparent is
    approached by analysing the velocities of electrons after
    passage through a cavity resonator from the formulae derived a
    calculation is made of the ratio of minimum possible mean
    square deviation of velocity to velocity increment due to the
    field assuming the volume of the cavity to be of the same order
    as and the initial electron velocity to be of the order
    of
