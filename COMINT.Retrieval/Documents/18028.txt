amalgamations and libraries. in 1982, 30 australian
    colleges of advanced education, principally teacher-training
    institutions, will be amalgamating. this study, undertaken with
    the support of the victorian post-secondary education
    commission, considers the problems likely to face the libraries
    of those institutions because of amalgamation and multi-site
    operation. the author visited uk polytechnic libraries in oct
    81 and produced guidelines for administrators and librarians of
    australian colleges derived from the substantial polytechnic
    experience of such problems.
