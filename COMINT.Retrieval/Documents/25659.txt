results of a statistical study of the references cited in
    the search reports established by the epo (january 1981).
    53,713 reports of official searches carried out for the
    european patent office, the national patent offices of france,
    switzerland, and the netherlands, and standard searches were
    statistically analysed to determine whether it would have been
    possible to limit the searches to documents from a certain
    country, to patent documents only, or to certain time spans
    only. it seems that in certain fields (such as mechanics) the
    search could disregard non-patent literature, but all other
    limitations seem to result in a loss of information.
