a method for analysing values of the scalar magnetic
    intensity the method uses a series for the square of the scalar
    intensity the terms of which are obtained from the spherical
    harmonics generally applied to each component of the intensity
    those magnetic characteristics normally given by analysis of
    the vector intensity are obtained
