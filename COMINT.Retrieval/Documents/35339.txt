attitude study of on-line terminal operators on
    work-station arrangements. a questionnaire survey was conducted
    covering 75 on-line terminal operators at a large gas utility.
    they were asked to give preference ratings to alternative
    arrangements with regard to panelling, seating, background
    music, and the location of a terminal on the desk. the majority
    of the respondents preferred an open space layout to layouts
    with some panels, and some background music to no music. these
    results are in conformity with the findings of most past
    studies. as to seating arrangements, they gave the highest
    preference to a random arrangement made independent of the
    employee's sex or seniority. with respect to the location of a
    terminal, the lefthand side of the operator was rated highest
    by about 1/2 of the respondents, and the centre of the desk by
    1/4 of them.
