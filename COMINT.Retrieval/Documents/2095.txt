literature provision and librarianship for the mentally
    handicapped in the netherlands. following the publication of
    the report of the committee on books for the mentally
    handicapped in apr 80 in the netherlands the nederlands
    bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and
    literature) appointed a staff-member responsible for the
    provision of books for the handicapped. at the same time the
    nblc set up a working party to create contacts with publishers,
    authors and illustrators, to advise on library work with the
    mentally handicapped and to review the suitability of new books
    for this group. as a result of the working party's efforts some
    libraries have set aside special opening times for the mentally
    handicapped and library work with the mentally handicapped is
    now taught as part of the course at several dutch library
    schools.
