equivalent circuits of coils with distributed
    capacitances the equivalent circuit comprises an ideal coil a
    certain number of positive capacitances two in the case of a
    coil with one winding and an additional capacitance which can
    be either positive or negative depending on the relative
    magnitude and the exact distribution of the various parasitic
    capacitances
