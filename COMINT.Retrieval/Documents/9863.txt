combined photographic and radio echo observations of
    meteors measurements have been made on a bright geminid meteor
    by means of a meniscus schmidt camera and two pulsed radio
    transmitters operating at frequencies near thirty six mcs the
    radio echo duration is found to be several orders of magnitude
    less than would be expected from simple diffusion theory this
    behaviour is explained in terms of the attachment of electrons
    to neutral oxygen molecules to form negative ions and a value
    for the attachment coefficient is determined
