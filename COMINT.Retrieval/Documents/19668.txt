the equivalent q of rc networks the effective q factor of
    a rc phase shift network is defined as one half the rate of
    change of phase with frequency at the operating point for
    networks commonly used as frequency determining elements the
    effective q value is about unity but a capacitance type of r
    bridge t network may have a q value of
