direct voltage instantaneous breakdown of oil impregnated
    paper capacitors as a function of area the experimental results
    given show that the variation of mean breakdown voltage with
    increasing area is represented adequately by milnors equation
    the coefficient of variation appears to be independent of area
    but decreases with increasing thickness of dielectric
