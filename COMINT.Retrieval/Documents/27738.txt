new standards for public library premises in norway.
    outlines the proposal for new standards for public library
    premises, worked out by a committee appointed by the norwegian
    state directorate for public and school libraries. the
    committee examined 1,316 libraries outside oslo during its
    preparation of the proposal. the importance of flexibility is
    acknowledged and the proposal divides library functions into
    'shall' functions required by existing legislation and optional
    functions.
