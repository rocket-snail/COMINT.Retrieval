penetration of an electromagnetic wave into a
    ferromagnetic material an investigation of the magnetization of
    metallic ribbon toroidal cores with rectangular hysteresis loop
    used as computer storage elements approximate solutions are
    obtained for the field inside the core under different
    conditions of loading theoretical and experimental output
    waveforms show close agreement for high magnetizing force and
    thickness of core material mil
