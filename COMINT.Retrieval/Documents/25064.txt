experiences in the introduction of on-line services in
    industry. on-line services have been offered on a commercial
    basis in west germany since 1975, but are still not widely
    used. an example of an on-line service used in industry is
    dokumentation maschinenbau (doma). this service has 17 users in
    industry, mainly in mechanical engineering branches but also in
    electrical engineering, chemical and consumer goods concerns.
    the users are generally confined to large scale businesses
    employing between 1,000-25,000 people. to make efficient use of
    the doma service it is necessary to have been running a
    successful documentation department for several years, to use
    the on-line service to implement the existing information
    activity and to have staff who are kept up to date with
    research and development of on-line services. doma provides
    personnel training and helps with installation of hardware
    besides providing advice during the trial period. this aspect
    of on-line services is vital and to underest imate leads to
    unsatisfactory results.
