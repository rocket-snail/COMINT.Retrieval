the electrification of precipitation and thunderstorms a
    review article cosmic rays radioactivity and other agencies
    produce ion pairs which are transferred to cloud droplets or
    ice crystals and establish a droplet charge distribution
    greatly influenced by differences in conductivity for positive
    and negative ions rain formed from these droplets may be
    electrified usually both positive and negative drops being
    present processes are considered which charge this rain and and
    may eventually lead to a lightning stroke the conditions
    necessary to establish gross free charge distributions by
    regeneration are specified and shown to be met under frequently
    occurring meteorological situations references
