some implications of slant e slant e is common in polar
    regions the virtual height of traces rising from up to a linear
    characteristic passing through the origin relates virtual
    height and frequency it is suggested that slant e is due to
    back scatter from e four modes of propagation are possible
    direct back scatter reflected back scatter single reflected
    scatter double scatter experiments are suggested which would
    distinguish between them
