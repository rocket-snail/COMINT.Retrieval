the usbc and control of the bibliographic database. a
    number of problems have arisen by the use of isbn for
    computerised bibliographic records. the need for a control
    number that is not subject to misapplication either by human
    error or through faults in its structure has led to the concept
    of the universal standard book code (usbc). the structure and
    function of usbc is described briefly and the ability of usbc
    to detect duplicates in data bases is highlighted.
