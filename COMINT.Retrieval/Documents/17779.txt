monochromatic character of bursts of solar rf radiation
    bursts of solar radiation in the region were recorded
    simultaneously by two receivers tuned to frequency bands about
    apart analysis of the observations indicates that the average
    effective bandwidth of all bursts is about and that of high
    intensity bursts ie with intensities more than above the
    average is about a note on similar work was published by e
