toroidal transformers pass video bandwidths television
    video transformers are wound on supermalloy tape wound toroids
    having a low frequency permeability of diminishing with
    increasing frequency a bandwidth of is obtainable these
    transformers may be used for matching a coaxial cable and for
    interstage coupling in transistor video amplifiers
