sources of antagonism to 'qualitative' research.
    contribution to an issue on the application of qualitative
    approaches to the study of information problems. considers why
    quantitative methods are believed to be more 'scientific',
    rigorous, and valid than qualitative ones and argues that the
    term 'qualitative' is applied to different aspects of research
    which are sufficiently independent of each other to make the
    quantitative/qualitative distinction artificial. suggests that
    criticisms of qualitative research are 'ideological in the
    sense that they give support to existing institutions wherein
    some classes or groups (research sponsors) try to exert control
    over others'. typical criticisms of such research are analysed
    to expose the nature of the underlying expressions of
    interest.
