diffraction of electromagnetic waves by an aperture in an
    infinite screen an approximate solution is derived for
    conditions of normal incidence on a perfectly conducting screen
    the method is applicable where the aperture is large compared
    with and reduces the problem to one of scalar boundary
    values
