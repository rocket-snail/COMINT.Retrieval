effect of a metal plate on total reflection the phase
    changes which occur on total reflection are modified when a
    metal plate is placed near and parallel to the reflecting
    boundary by moving the plate the phase difference between plane
    waves of equal amplitudes polarized in and perpendicular to the
    plane of incidence can be varied from up to the positive value
    obtained without the plate this has been confirmed
    experimentally using a wavelength of and a perspex prism when
    the refractive index is there are two positions of the plate
    for which the reflected wave is circularly polarized the
    electric vector rotating in opposite directions for these two
    positions
