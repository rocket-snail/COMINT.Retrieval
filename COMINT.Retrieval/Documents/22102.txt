authority systems 2. problems in establishing a name file
    for nigerian authors. paper presented at the 1st session of the
    section on cataloguing, ifla conference, copenhagen, 1979.
    discusses problems in establishing a cataloguing authority file
    for nigerian names, posed by the incidence of personal names,
    honorifics, the combination of a personal name with a family or
    place name, and appellations attached to the name mohammed.
    librarians must cooperate with publishers and the authors
    themselves to find solutions to the problem. one such solution
    may be the capitalisation of the entry part of the name on the
    title page of a work, which would greatly assist all national
    and international users of nigeria's catalogues and national
    bibliographies.
