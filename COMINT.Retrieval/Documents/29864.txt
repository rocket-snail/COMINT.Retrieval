some magnetic properties of metals part magnetic
    behaviour of a cylindrical system of electrons for all magnetic
    fields the schrodinger equation is solved for an electron
    moving in a uniform magnetic field h the boundary of the system
    being a cylinder with its axis along the direction of the field
    two entirely different types of wave function are possible one
    type leading to the small landau diamagnetism of large systems
    the other to he larger diamagnetism of small systems of april
    taking account of the occupied states of both types the steady
    contributions to the magnetic susceptibility are determined for
    low high and intermediate temperatures
