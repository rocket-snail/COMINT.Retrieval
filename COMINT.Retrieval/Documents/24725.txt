use of servo techniques in the design of amplitude
    stabilized oscillators expressions for the oscillation
    amplitude in terms of the stabilizing signal voltage are
    derived and the amplitude stabilizing system is discussed as a
    negative feedback loop experimental and theoretical results for
    a high q oscillator are compared
