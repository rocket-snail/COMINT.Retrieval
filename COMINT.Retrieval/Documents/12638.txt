availability of veterinary information in the veterinary
    libraries, members of the veterinary medical section/medical
    library association for latin america. the veterinary
    libraries, members of the vms/mla, have
    information/documentation services oriented towards the
    biomedical field. in south america, it seems that this
    information is oriented toward animal industry and animal
    husbandry. little is known about the needs of veterinary users
    or the veterinary collections in south american libraries. the
    information available in the vms/mla is from the work and
    activities of its committees. in each individual library,
    access to the important data bases, e.g. cab, biosis, medline
    and agricola, is available. access to the catalogue of each
    veterinary library is also available on microfilm or in a
    printed form.
