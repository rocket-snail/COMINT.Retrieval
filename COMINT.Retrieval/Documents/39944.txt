an estimate of electron densities in the exosphere by
    means of nose whistlers by examining successive members of
    families of nose whistler for march it was possible to choose
    between three mos of electron density distribution for the
    exosphere the distribution with the best fit was where n is
    electron density r is the distance from the earths centre and k
    is a constant this fact suggests that the density at earth
    radii is of the order of electrons cm
