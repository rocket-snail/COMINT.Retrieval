energy distribution of thermo electrons in electron beam
    devices experiments are described which show that the energy
    distribution of the thermo electrons in oscillograph tubes
    electron microscopes etc is not of the maxwell type the
    deviations from the maxwell distribution particularly in the
    low energy range are attributed to reciprocal dynamic
    effects
