characteristics of micros and their applications. in
    recent years, the market in microcomputers has mushroomed
    making such systems available at prices from under
    *6100-*610,000's, rivalling the facilities and power of
    minicomputers or even small mainframes. gives a brief history
    of the development of microcomputers and describes the various
    components of such a system. pays particular attention to the
    type of component that is likely to be available in systems
    which can be classified as 'small business systems' and
    investigates the applications of such systems. despite the vast
    market in microcomputers, there are still many restrictions
    which may prevent their being used in some applications, such
    as the capacity of the primary memory. furthermore, there are
    very few standards in the area of microcomputers, leading to
    problems of compatibility both from the hardware and software
    viewpoint. such problems are being overcome at present but it
    is likely that they will persist for some time to come as the
    pressures of marketing cannot wait for standards to be
    developed. the restrictions of microcomputers are also being
    overcome, particularly with the development of 16-bit (and even
    32-bit) processors and more sophisticated methods of storage,
    such as 'bubble memories'. examines such developments and
    briefly contrasts developments in hardware with those in
    software.
