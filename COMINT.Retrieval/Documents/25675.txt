new developments in the auto sembly technique of circuit
    fabrication various applications of the technique previously
    described of danko and lanzalotti are reviewed new copper faced
    plastics are suitable for production of equipment for operating
    temperatures up to use of a solder resistant paint or lacquer
    enables joints only to be soldered in the soler dip process
    typical examples of circuits and assemblies produced by this
    method are illustrated
