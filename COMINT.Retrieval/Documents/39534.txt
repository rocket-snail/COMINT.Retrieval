different stations the possibility that the day to day
    changes in absorption at slough swansea and freiburg are
    identical is examined statistically after allowing for known
    sources of error it is considered that the residual differences
    in summer months are too small to be significant but that it is
    probable that real differences occur in winter in both cases
    the minimum probable correlation for the swansea slough
    comparison is very high
