nordinfo course in bibliometrics, 1981-10-26-29,
    hanassari, helsinki, swedish-finnish cultural centre (in
    swedish). describes the discipline of bibliometrics with
    reference to a nordinfo course attended in helsinki. defines
    bibliometrics as quantitative measurement of library
    techniques. bibliometric methods can be used on a global scale,
    but they can also be a tool to calculate the best use of an
    individual library's resources. among the empirical laws
    developed, bradford's law is the most applicable. describes the
    use of this law to obtain a graph with an exponentially
    increasing part, a so-called bradford graph. this can show the
    relationship between authors and number of articles, articles
    and quotations and can help to determine the process of
    obsolescence of literature in a library. other bibliometric
    laws are those of lotka and zipf. the methods are useful in
    acquisition, planning of space allocation, withdrawals, library
    use, and other areas of library administration.
