x-ray' usa o-uk 1. in the 85 years since x-ray
    photographs were first produced, the world has been littered
    with millions of x-ray sheets. profile microfilm (kent) ltd.
    has started to produce microfilm of x-ray plates. the task is
    not easy, as the density of the original x-ray plate is
    difficult to maintain. after 15 years of sporadic microfilming
    of x-rays in various countries, profile microfilm ltd. has
    achieved the right combination between the film emulsion and
    the chemicals. the special x-ray camera used may also be used
    in libraries and elsewhere; it offers improved resolution and
    an automatic exposure control system with projectable
    photocell, and a variable height book copier table.
