the effectivity of microfilm technique. certain aspects
    of the introduction and use of microfilm techniques must be
    observed in order that the possible rationalisation effects may
    be best used. it must be remembered that problems can arise
    through the possibilities of manifold application of microfilm
    techniques, which are not necessarily best solved from the
    economic point of view just by the use of special equipment.
    manufacturers and users of microfilm equipment must cooperate
    to achieve an agreement on the production of a range of
    equipment suited to its purposes and on long-term basic
    production measures. methods of estimating the effectivity of
    microfilm techniques are presented, with regard to current
    service efficiency, types of information work carried out, the
    kind, size and number of documents involved, the range of users
    and the calculation of unit costs and possible savings.
