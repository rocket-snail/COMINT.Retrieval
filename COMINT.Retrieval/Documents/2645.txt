radio observation of the earth satellite describes
    observations of field strength bearing and doppler shift of the
    signal it is considered that to explain anomalous field
    strengths and doppler shifts propagation involving ground
    scattering followed by ionospheric reflection must be
    considered anomalous doppler effects include rapidly varying
    shift and apparent recession when the satellite is approaching
    the receiver
