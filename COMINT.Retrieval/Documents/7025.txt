the diurnal development of the anomalous equatorial belt
    in the f region of the ionosphere a study is made of the
    latitudinal distribution of for each hour of the day for the
    equinoctial months at sunspot minimum and also of the diurnal
    variation of at a number of low latitude stations the observed
    behaviour of in both cases is suggested to be due not only to
    vertical drift of ionization but also to horizontal movement
    between the poles and the equator during the day
