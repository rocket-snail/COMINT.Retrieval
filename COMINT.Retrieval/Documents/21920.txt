computer storage and retrieval of generic chemical
    structures in patents. 2. gensal, a formal language for the
    description of generic chemical structures. a formal language,
    gensal, is described which is designed for the concise and
    unambiguous representation of generic structures from chemical
    patents ('markush formulas') in a manner which is intelligible
    to a chemist, yet sufficiently formalised for automatic
    analysis by a computer. gensal contains a number of facilities
    for showing the alternatives possible in a generic structure
    and any special restrictions placed on their variety.
    experience to date suggests that gensal is capable of dealing
    with most of the types of generic statement encountered in
    patents.
