archival resources and history' some ideas on a
    systems-prospectus approach. discusses the relationship between
    historical research and archival operations, where the
    interdependence of the 2 constitutes a system resulting in the
    production of history. traces the development of the concept of
    the archive from the 19th century onwards, with reference to
    the evolution of a concept of history based not on thematic or
    quantitative approaches, but seeking to generate new objects of
    study. the crucial necessity for full cooperation between
    archivists and researchers is illustrated, and shown to be
    essential for a prospectus reading of the present and the past,
    unencumbered by transitory contemporary attitudes.
