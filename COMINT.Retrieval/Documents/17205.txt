the interaction between an obliquely incident plane
    electromagnetic wave and a electron beam part the investigation
    reported is relevant to the operation of mm wave generators and
    to phenomena occurring in the solar corona analysis is
    presented for magnetic field vector and electric field vector
    of the incident wave perpendicular to the electron beam the
    general solution for an arbitrarily polarized wave is obtained
    as the sum of the two separate solutions when the axial phase
    velocity of the wave is equal to the beam velocity the beam
    behaves like a metal reflector coupling between different modes
    in the scattered wave and in the wave inside the beam is taken
    into account this coupling vanishes if the wave is incident
    normally or if the beam is in vacuum resonance occurs at
    certain values of beam velocity
