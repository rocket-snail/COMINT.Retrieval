the determination of ionospheric electron content and
    distribution from satellite observations the theory of the
    determination is given for measurements of total rotation of
    angle of polarization and also of its rate of rotation
    modifications to the simple theory and sources of errors are
    discussed observations made using sputnik three have disclosed
    a diurnal variation in totol electron content and data relating
    to the proportion of the total content which lies below the f
    layer peak the effect of magnetic disturbances is
    described
