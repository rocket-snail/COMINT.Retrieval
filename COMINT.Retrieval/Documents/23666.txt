amplification of small alternating voltages with the
    magnetic amplifier a theoretical investigation of the
    conditions under which saturated reactors are suitable for
    amplifying sall alternating voltages a parallel choke circuit
    with self saturation was found to be suitable and a two stage
    amplifier based on this circuit is described the amplification
    obtainable is sufficient to give a galvanometer indication with
    voltages down to
