the variation with distance in the range km of
    atmospheric waveforms records of the electric field variation
    of a violent thunderstorm made at distances of are analysed
    over portion which cov large and rapid increase in field
    strength corresponding t to the return stroke of the lightning
    discharge theoretical and experimental results for the waveform
    the ratio of the maximum es field to the net es change and the
    current in the discharge are in fair agreement
