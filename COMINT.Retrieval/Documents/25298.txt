broadband rotary waveguide attenuator the attenuator
    comprises three collinear sections of round waveguide each with
    a resistive film arranged in a diametral plane the middle
    section is rotated to obtain the desired attenuation some
    performance figures are given for an experimental model the
    characteristics are independent of frequency
