some possible effects caused by strong gyro waves in the
    ionosphere a theory is developed for the effect of an extremely
    powerful pulse of extra ordinary gyro waves on the nocturnal e
    region near km and the day time d region near km the changes in
    collisional frequency and electron density at these levels are
    derived with their consequent effects on the propagation
    characteristics of a transverse ordinary wave at kcs it is
    shown that with radio pulses of sufficient power observable
    changes may be produced in air glow meteor trails fast particle
    tracks and local magnetic elements it would also be possible to
    use such a pulse to determine the coefficient of attachment at
    the km and km levels
