the absorption of centimetre electromagnetic waves in
    artificially anisotropic media two methods of equalizing the
    complex permeability and dielectric coefficient of a medium to
    obtain absorption at are discussed in one case the medium
    consists of thin parallel layers in the other use is made of
    gyromagnetic resonance in ferrite material subjected to a
    static magnetic field experimental results are given
