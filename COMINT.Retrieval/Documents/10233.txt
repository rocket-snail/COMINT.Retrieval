property and the constitution. delivery of depository
    copies to state libraries in reference to paragraph 14 of the
    basic law (grundgesetz). the controversial question as to
    whether publishers should be legally required to supply
    depository copies free of charge to libraries is once again
    being discussed in west germany. some publishers in
    baden-wurttemberg challenged this requirement and took their
    case before the federal constitutional court. an amended law
    was passed in baden-wurttemberg as a result of this action
    whereby publishers are still required to supply 1 copy free of
    charge but can be recompensed for up to 50% of their costs for
    any further copies. in the light of the constitution delivering
    depository copies is to be seen as a social duty directly
    linked to property ownership. the publisher has a duty to the
    public to supply libraries with current literature but a
    balance must be struck between this and the financial limits of
    the publisher.
