incoherent microwave radiation from a plasma in a
    magnetic field the microwave emission from a plasma in a
    magnetic field is calculated theoretically using kirchhoffs
    radiation law for cases when characteristic waves do not couple
    within the plasma experimental observations of radiation
    temperatures and cyclotron radiation line breadth and shape are
    cited to illustrate applications of he theory to
    experiment
