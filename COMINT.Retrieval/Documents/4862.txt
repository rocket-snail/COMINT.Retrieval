the design of a simple modulator of moderate cost a low
    power pulse generator for laboratory work designed to deliver
    or pulses at varying repetition frequencies when the load
    impedance may vary between and is described since the power
    required is low a type thyratron with a delay line in the anode
    circuit is used to drive the double tetrode modulator
