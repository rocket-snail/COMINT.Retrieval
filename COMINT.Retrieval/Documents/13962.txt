serial control in a developed machine system. argues that
    the developed machine systems of the future will not be based
    on present linear machine records, but will operate upon a
    complex network of simple records. such a network will have
    special application to the problems relating to the control of
    bibliographic information on serials. the problems of
    chronological and hierarchical linkage of serials are analysed
    and related to the proposed new system. the proposed system
    will also provide beneficial effects for serials check in,
    serials cataloguing, and catalogue users.
