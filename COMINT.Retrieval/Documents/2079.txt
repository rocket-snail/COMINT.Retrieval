measurement of service at a public library. data
    collection and analysis techniques were applied to study volume
    of use, user activity, and availability of items sought by
    users in a public library. stratified sampling methods employed
    to measure volume of use and user activity showed that this
    medium-sized public library provided approximately 4,000 user
    service hours per week. the average visit lasted 34 minutes
    with 32% of all visit time spent reading library materials.
    overall availability of items sought by users in the adult
    section was approximately 38%. the application of these
    measurement techniques, which can be carried out by relatively
    untrained staff or volunteers, to pinpoint possible
    improvements in library service is discussed.
