radio frequency spectrometer with bidirectional square
    wave frequency modulation modulation is effected by means of a
    voltage controlled si capacitor coupled to the oscillator tank
    circuit if the frequency deviation is greater than the line
    width the absorption line will be displayed with full available
    intensity and good shape by careful adjustment of the relative
    amplitude of the positive and negative going deviations
    incidental amplitude modulation in the rf detector output
    component can be eliminated this method should be applicable to
    other types of spectrometers
