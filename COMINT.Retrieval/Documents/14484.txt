low latitude and high latitude geomagnetic agitation
    detailed study is made of geomagnetic agitation above the three
    daily maxima of have spiral loci agitation is an order of
    magnitude lower at middle latitudes increasing again towards
    the equator ionospheric current systems with auroral
    electrojets are examined in the above context the occurrence
    frequency of sudden commencements at one station exhibits a
    diurnal variation a recent theoretical explanation of this is
    examined
