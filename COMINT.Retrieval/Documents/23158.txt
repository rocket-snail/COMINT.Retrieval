variation of the dispersion of radio whistlers during
    magnetic storms the whistler dispersion shows a special
    decrease at poitiers after the commencement of an intense
    magnetic storm the decrease is not observed for lesser storms
    this is possibly due to the existence of favoured paths which
    move to lower latitudes as the storm intensity increases
