matrix analysis of linear time varying circuits on cavity
    resonators with nonhomogeneous media perturbation theory is
    used to find the frequencies of oscillation and factors of a
    cavity containing a medium for which the permittivity and the
    permeability are arbitrary functions of position the theory is
    applied to cylindrical cavity containing a disc of dielectric
    which dies not extend over the complete cross section of the
    cavity
