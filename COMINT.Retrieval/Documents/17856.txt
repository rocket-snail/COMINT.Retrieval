valve matching using resistors desired characteristics
    can be obtained by including resistors in series and or
    parallel with a valve formulae for the effective parameters are
    tabulated for several simple combinations matching of ac
    characteristics may in practice be accompanied by reasonable
    matching of the overall dc characteristics a circuit is shown
    using the latter effect for determining resistances required
    for matching two valves
