library description' where muses are preserved-the dutch
    literary museum and archives centre. the nederlands
    letterkundig museum en documentatiecentrum was founded in the
    hague in 1953. the museum was greatly expanded in 1954 by a
    former city archivist of the hague, dr. w. moll, who deposited
    on permanent loan his private collection of 360 boxes of
    material relating to about 1,500 dutch authors. the collection
    now contains manuscripts, corrected proofs, publishers'
    contracts, book illustrations, portraits and gramophone and
    tape-recordings relating to dutch authors of the post-1750
    period. the museum is financed partly by the dutch government
    and partly by the city council and has an annual purchase grant
    of approximately *64,000. in 1982 the museum will be rehoused
    in the new royal library buildings at present nearing
    completion in the hague.
