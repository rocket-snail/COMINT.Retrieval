cbs stepping out for french teletext. impatient with the
    delays created by the electronic industries association's
    subcommittee on teletext, cbs inc. has endorsed the
    french-developed antiope teletext system as a us standard. the
    main reasons why it was preferred over competing systems
    (including the uk ceefax and oracle) is its capacity for
    accommodating changes in technology. this is because it is a
    software system with its data stream formulated independently
    of the transmission mode.
