novel circuit for a stable variable frequency oscillator
    a circuit designed to reduce the effect of resonator frequency
    drift uses a multiloop feedback arrangement with three
    oscillators maintained at frequencies such that one is the sum
    of the other two the sum frequency being controlled by a quartz
    crystal while the other two are controlled by variable
    resonators the circuit and frequency drift temperature
    characteristics of an experimental oscillator are shown
