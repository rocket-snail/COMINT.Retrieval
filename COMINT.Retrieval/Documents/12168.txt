wide range electronic tuning of microwave cavities
    analysis is presented for tuning by introducing into the cavity
    an electron beam with its direction parallel to the magnetic
    field so that spiralling of the beam is produced measurements
    are reported indicating that the tuning range is much greater
    for a cavity containing z a gas at low pressure than for an
    evacuated cavity
