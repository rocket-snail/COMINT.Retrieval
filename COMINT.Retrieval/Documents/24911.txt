    immigrant languages!. the basis of a norwegian immigration
    policy is laid down in parliamentary statements numbers 39 of
    1973-74 and 74 of 1979-80. these emphasise that there must be
    equality for all to practise religious, cultural, and social
    activities. libraries must make literature and other media
    available so that immigrants can maintain their cultural links
    with the mother country. but they must also make material
    available which can facilitate that immigrants' adaptation to
    the new country and its language and give the majority
    population information on the immigrants' background. the
    deichman library in oslo began in 1975 to act as a central
    library to public libraries as regards immigrant literature.
    the library also issues deposits to libraries. stresses the
    importance for children of competence in the mother tongue and
    calls for a nordic cooperation in production of children's
    literature in immigrant languages.
