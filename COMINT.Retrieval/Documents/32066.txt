polar ionospheric spread echoes and radio frequency
    properties of ice shelves records from three stations in the
    antarctic and one drifting stations in the antarctic and one
    drifting station in the arctic show that downward radiation
    from an ionosonde aerial is reflected from sea water under the
    ice an interference pattern is established from which it is
    possible to determine the thickness and dielectric constant of
    the ice and the direction from which ionospheric spread echoes
    arise
