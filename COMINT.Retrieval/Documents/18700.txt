spectrum or waveform equalization the method of
    equalization in which signals obtained by differentiation or
    integration are added to the main signal of is compared with
    the commoner method using filters empirical design is simpler
    with the former method but the need for additional
    amplification at high frequencies n is not avoided the
    different requirements of communication and servo systems are
    indicated
