a magnetic device for high speed sensing of small
    currents the structure and operation of the ferror device are
    described it comprises a bar of low coercive force square loop
    ferrite with two holes transverse to the long axis the material
    around the holes acts as a pair of toroidal cores whose
    switchable flux may be controlled by a solenoid current
