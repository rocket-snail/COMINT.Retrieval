the direct method of filter and delay line synthesis
    extension of previous work of the direct method consists in
    postulating an indefinitely recurring network in which each
    recurring element is coupled to all elements of the network and
    in determining the values of these elements and of their
    indefinitely extended couplings which will yield the exact
    phase characteristics desired within the exact pass band
    desired examples are given of the application of the method to
    the design of ideal band pass filters
