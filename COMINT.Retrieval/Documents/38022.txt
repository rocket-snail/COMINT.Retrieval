spaced observations of the low frequency radiation from
    the earths upper atmosphere observations of radio noise with a
    network of four stations extending across southern australia
    are described it is shown tht there is often good correlation
    of the amplitude variations over a distance of and tht the
    observed amplitude differences may be explained by assuming tht
    the radiation propagates in the earth ionosphere waveguide from
    geographically large sources some discrete sources were
    observed
