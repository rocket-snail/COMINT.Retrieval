regarding classifications of the sciences and
    bibliographic classifications. the distinction between
    knowledge classifications and bibliographic classifications has
    been justified by the multi-dimensional character of knowledge
    and the uni-dimensional character of bibliographic
    classification. semantic catalogues exist in a logical state of
    probability not only because of the temporal distance between
    their preparation and consultation, but because they can never
    be verified, except after a great time lag. the problem is
    always the search for formulae for references providing the
    greatest guarantee of intercommunication between subjects.
    there is a vital need to define theoretically and logically the
    'subject' in relation to the 'object'.
