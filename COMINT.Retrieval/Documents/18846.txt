on the theory of the diffraction of a plane wave by a
    large perfectly conducting circular cylinder the boundary value
    problem is treated for the case of an incident harmonic plane
    em wave on a cylinder of radius much greater than the
    wavelength the method used is a straight forward application of
    a fourier integral transform analysis to a boundary value
    problem
