ionization and recombination processes in a plasma and
    the ionization formula of the solar corona for a plasma not in
    thermodynamic equilibrium formulae are derived for the photo
    ionization the ionization by collisions the recombination with
    emission of light and the recombination due to triple
    collisions by equating the number of collisions by equating the
    number of collision ionizations with the number of
    photorecombinations an ionization formula is obtained for the
    solar corona from which the temperature of the corona can be
    estimated
