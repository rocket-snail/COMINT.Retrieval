do not tear down what has so successfully been built up.
    reports the speech by the danish library association's
    chairman, karl johan mortensen, to the meeting of the
    kommunernes landsforening (national association of local
    authorities), where the question had earlier been raised of how
    culture could be disseminated to larger circles. it was argued
    that expansion of library activities was not enough to reach
    those unfamiliar with libraries. the institutional framework
    had prevented genuine decentralisation and popularisation of
    culture. libraries with rigid management and demand for
    qualified staff were preventing their use as local culture
    centres. solutions involving greater coordination with other
    local activities were offered. against this mortensen argues
    that the 1964 library act promoted decentralisation and that
    libraries more than other institutions are reaching the broad
    population. warns against reduction of library activities in
    order to help the grass roots movements. local aut horities
    need the support of the state for library services. the debate
    that followed and the reply from the national association's
    chairman stressed that libraries were not under attack.
