evaluation of reference collections in public, community
    college, and high school libraries. briefly reviews the
    literature relating to the evaluation of reference collections
    in public, community college and high school libraries, and
    compares the views of a sample of us librarians in these 3
    types of libraries on this evaluation. concludes that there is
    a gap not only between what has been reported in the literature
    concerning evaluation of library collections and the actual
    world of libraries and librarians, but also between what
    librarians feel is important and valuable about evaluation, and
    what they are actually doing in their libraries.
