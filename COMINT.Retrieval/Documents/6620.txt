electromagnetic phenomena of natural origin in the band a
    report is presented of observations made at an isolated region
    in oregon in the summer of air core detector coils were used
    one with an effective area of for observing the vertical
    magnetic field component and another with an effective area of
    for the horizontal north south component voltage waveforms
    proportional to the field and to its time rate of change were
    studied by means of photographic records from oscillographs the
    signals recorded are predominatly of burst type the horizontal
    component being more intense than the vertical the level of
    activity exhibits a systematic diurnal variation comparison
    with the incidence of atmospherics suggests that the low
    frequency signals are associated with lightning while the
    timing of the daytime maximum indicates that the propagation
    mechanism is different from that for the atmospherics
