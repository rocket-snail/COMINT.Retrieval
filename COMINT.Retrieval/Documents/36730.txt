synthesis techniques for gain band width optimization in
    passive transducers the technique produces from the idealized
    gain bandwidth constraints which ensure matching to a given
    load a set of functions specifying the equalizer along the
    fixed transducer is synthesized from these functions examples
    illustrating the technique are given
