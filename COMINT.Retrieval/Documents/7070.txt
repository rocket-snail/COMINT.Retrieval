ionospheric absorption investigations at hawaii and
    johnston island the absorption of cosmic noise at thirty mcs
    varies in such a way as to suggest that the patches of
    absorption are less than one thousand km in size the variations
    are not correlated with the spread f or with the sporadic e
    phenomena but are correlated with f suggesting partial
    reflection of the cosmic noise by the f layer
