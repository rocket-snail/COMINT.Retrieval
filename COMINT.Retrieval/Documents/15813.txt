simultaneous recording of atmospherics on four different
    frequency bands in the low frequency region the number and
    intensity of atmospherics are recorded simultaneously on four
    narrow bands at and results show atmospherics with large field
    strengths to be less frequent than those with small field
    strengths on all bands and the field strength of atmospherics
    to be a maximum in the band
