techniques of classification in psychology i' factor
    analysis, facet analyses, multidimensional scaling, latent
    structure analysis. classification problems are quite common in
    psychology, and many classification procedures have been
    developed and applied to this science. the most commonly used
    technique in psychology is factor analysis. describes the
    underlying model of factor analysis, its indeterminacy
    problems, modifications and extensions. also discusses facet
    analysis and multidimensional scaling (mds), which can be used
    either as a preliminary stage for other classification
    procedures or as a classification method itself. a distinction
    is made between metric and non-metric mds procedures, and
    between methods for proximity data, dominance data, profile
    data, and conjoint measurement data. finally the models and
    applications of latent structure analysis are discussed.
