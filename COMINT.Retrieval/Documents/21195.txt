frequency divider with direct locking investigation is
    carried out by the phase pulse method the effect of phase shift
    in the feedback circuit nd of anode reaction on the divider
    regime is considered the effect of the shape of the
    synchronized and pedestal pulses on the divider is also
    examined theoretical data are verified by experimental
    results
