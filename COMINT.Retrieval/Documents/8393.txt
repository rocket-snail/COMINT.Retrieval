approximate theory of ferrimagnetic spin waves the wave
    functions and the energy spectrum for the spin wave problem in
    a normal spinel are found by means of a straightforward
    extension of andersons approach to antiferromagnetism on only
    ab exchange is assumed to exist and the calculation is carried
    to second order in the magnitude of the propagation vector k
    five distinct energy surfaces are found two of which are
    identical in the classical limit to the ones previously
