how shall the library approach the immigrants?. the
    library services to immigrants in denmark are governed by the
    general rule of equal access to library services. for practical
    reasons, this means that part of the service must be
    centralised, viz. selection, acquisition and preparation of the
    material. gentofte public library has since 1970 had a central
    collection of immigrant literature available to other
    libraries. the choice of material must be made in consultation
    with people knowledgeable about the groups and their conditions
    in the new country. the selection must also reflect the need,
    not only for fictional, but also for informative literature
    both about the homeland and the adopted country. more
    audio-visual material and a better classification system are
    necessary. the efforts of the local library catering for very
    small groups of immigrants must, apart from collections of
    reference works and classics, be concentrated on contact work
    and cultural arrangements.
