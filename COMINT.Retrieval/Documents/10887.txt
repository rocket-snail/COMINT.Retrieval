communication with an oclc model 100 terminal. the oclc
    model 100 computer terminal was designed originally to be used
    in conjunction with the oclc (online computer library center)
    on-line cataloguing system. this study considers the use of the
    terminal for other, more localised, computer applications as a
    user interface. the study shows how the 2 main disadvantages of
    the terminal; non-standard communications protocol and
    non-standard character set were overcome.
