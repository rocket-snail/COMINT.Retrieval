international development of information services in
    social sciences. many international organisations have
    participated in developing and coordinating information
    services in social sciences. some of these organisations have
    developed methods, and particular terminology. there is no
    established division of work between these organisations. it is
    important that information collected in different countries can
    be exchanged between different systems. the more mechanical
    this exchange is the more economical and faster it will be.
    unisist now also covers social sciences. a plan published in
    1972 includes unesco's programme for the development of
    information services in social sciences. unesco also supports
    financially some projects in the field, including ecssid
    programme. in 1975 oecd mapped the available information
    services in the field in europe. between 1971 and 1980 the
    british disiss project looked at the information services in
    social sciences and their quality. both projects concluded that
    information services have developed without any general
    long-term plan. 2 research projects in the field have been
    published in finland.
