magnetic field due to a direct current traversing a solid
    conductor of arbitrary shape application to a cylindrical
    conductor laplaces law usually known as biot and savarts law is
    shown to be more suitable than amperes magnetic sheet concept
    as a basis for deriving formulae for the magnetic field of a
    conductor the vector potential is introduced
