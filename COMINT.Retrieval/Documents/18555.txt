theory of the cathode sheath in a low density gas
    discharge the space charge equations of a low density gas
    discharge are derived and applied to the study of potential
    distributions in the cathode sheath one conclusion is that a
    positive column will begin to evolve when the number of
    ionization mean free paths in the discharge gap is of the same
    order as the square root of the ratio of electron to positive
    ion mass
