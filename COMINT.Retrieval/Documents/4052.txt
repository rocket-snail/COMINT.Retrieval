precision searching with the condor information system.
    condor (communication in natural language with dialogue
    oriented retrieval systems) developed by siemens since 1972, is
    an information system for processing structured and
    unstructured information. its precision search system makes
    possible a search for terms and also for terminological
    connections within a text. descriptions are included of'
    precision searching components, such as linguistic analysis;
    formation of analysis results into g-networks; discovery of
    relevant textual points assisted by 4 relevance functions; and
    retrieval dialogue. all components are being tested in the
    context of an office information system and a system on work
    safety; the system will begin operating during the
    1980s.
