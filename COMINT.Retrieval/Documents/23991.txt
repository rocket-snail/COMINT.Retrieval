the media index: computer-based access to nonprint
    materials. although full bibliographic access to non-print
    materials has been a goal of libraries, complete success has
    not been achieved. the library at california state university,
    los angeles, sought a way to access previously inaccessible
    elements of its recordings collection. the computer-based media
    index was designed with separate indexes for titles, subjects,
    and added entries (selections, composers, performers, etc.).
    this has proved to be an extremely useful tool and is readily
    adaptable to other forms of mediated material.
