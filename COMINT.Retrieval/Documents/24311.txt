the semantic problems of translated subject headings.
    study of the problems inherent in the translation of subject
    headings from english into korean. 4 different semantic
    entities are involved-the english of the original list, the
    classification numbers, and the korean translation list which
    must use both chinese ideograms and the korean alphabet.
    ultimately the classification number serves as the most
    accurate guide to the semantic content of the original term, as
    well as a guide to the most suitable term to express this in
    the language of the adaptation.
