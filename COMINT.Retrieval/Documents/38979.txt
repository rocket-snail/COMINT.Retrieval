the amplification of a magnetic field by a high current
    discharge it is shown theoretically that a helical current flow
    discharge is set up by a longitudinal magnetic field in which
    the plasma pressure is balanced by electrodynamic forces the
    direction of the helix is such that the initial longitudinal
    field is amplified some experimental evidence supports this
    theory
