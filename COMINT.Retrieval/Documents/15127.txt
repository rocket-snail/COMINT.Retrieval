flux resetting characteristics of full wave magnetic
    amplifier affected by the metallic rectifier quantitative
    relations between rectifier and flux resetting characteristics
    are investigated by a technique in which the effects of
    nonlinear forward and reverse characteristics of the rectifier
    are separated by means of mechanical synchronous
    contacts
