a method for measuring local electron density from an
    artificial satellite a proposal for a satellite equipped to
    measure the electric and magnetic fields in the radio wave set
    up in the neighbourhood of the satellite by whistler mode
    transmission from a grou d based v l f transmitter from the
    wave impedance given by the ratio of the fields the local
    electron density could be deduced
