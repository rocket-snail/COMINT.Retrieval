point contact transistor relaxation oscillators the
    plotting of phase curves for oscillators with emitter collector
    and collector capacitance are shown and possible operating
    modes investigated expressions are given for deriving the pulse
    parameters conditions are expressed for the appearance of step
    discontinuities as well as for a self oscillatory mode
