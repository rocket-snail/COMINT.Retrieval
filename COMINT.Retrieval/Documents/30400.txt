school library and documentation centres. operational
    experiences. a group of 3 articles, which originally appeared
    separately in 1978 and 1979 in bibliotheques centres
    documentaires, a french periodical, describing the integration
    of new libraries into different types of french schools, from
    several viewpoints. in the 1st article, 2 parents recount how
    the library was set up, developed functions and activities, and
    was received by teachers and pupils. the 2nd article gives 2
    contrasting accounts by teachers: the 1st shows how after
    initial hesitation, the library and school found how to adapt
    to and complement each others' activities; the 2nd describes a
    less successful project, where eventually functions had to be
    prescribed for the library as a result of its failure to
    develop its own sphere of activity. the last article discusses
    how 10 schools in rural areas are preparing for the
    installation of new libraries, both in obtaining resources to
    accommodate the libraries and in alertin g staff and
    pupils.
