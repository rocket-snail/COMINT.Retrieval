on the later employment possibilities of graduate
    librarians in a university library. owing to the further
    expansion in east germany of standardised university libraries
    consisting of a central library and branches in university
    departments, new problems have arisen in the last 10 years
    concerning the organisation, direction and planning of library
    procedure corresponding to the extended functions and
    dimensions of the university library. the institute of library
    science should ensure that graduate librarians receive
    appropriate training to allow them to cope with the work
    demanded of them at university libraries. this will include'
    all types of book processing; work with users; publicising
    library stock, especially cultural heritage collections;
    activity in halls of residence libraries; coordinating work
    between different sections of the university library; library
    technology; storage and maintenance. library graduates should
    be capable of understanding the theoretical content of practica
    l problems and finding solutions to them which can be carried
    out in practice.
