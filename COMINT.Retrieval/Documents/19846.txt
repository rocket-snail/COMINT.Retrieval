the accuracy of telephone reference services in the
    southeast' a case for quantitative standards. the telephone
    reference services of public and private college and university
    libraries in the 9 southeastern states of the usa were
    investigated using their responses to 12 fact-seeking telephone
    queries made over a 12-month period, their 1975 library general
    information survey data, and a questionnaire designed to
    identify independent variables related to reference services.
    only 50% of the test questions were answered correctly.
    independent variables such as service hours or volumes held
    were more closely related to accuracy of response than
    variables concerned with staff, indicating that staff ability
    to exploit a collection is more crucial than staff numbers.
    concludes that these results support calls for quantitative
    standards for reference services.
