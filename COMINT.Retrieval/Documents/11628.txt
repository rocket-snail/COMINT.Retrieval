notes on 'library, school, reading'. discussion of the
    role of the library in relation to the school in italy. with
    growing acceptance that the public library should promote
    cultural activities as well as make books available, the lack
    of any coherent organisational structure at national or local
    level coordinating activities in the public domain becomes very
    noticeable, particularly where schools and libraries are
    concerned in promoting reading habits. the situation at present
    is one of repressed rivalry, where roles are undefined. the
    divergent attitudes of teachers and librarians are discussed,
    with reference to reading in the context of the spread of
    audio-visual media.
