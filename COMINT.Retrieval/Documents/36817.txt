the state central theatrical library in the library
    network. the state central theatrical library is one of the
    most popular libraries in moscow and offers a wide range of
    services to many workers in the arts. its specialised stocks,
    built up since 1922, form an integral part of the resources of
    the soviet library network. there is scope, however, for
    greater cooperation with other libraries, especially in the
    field of education, and there is a need for a whole new
    approach to the organisation of the library before it can
    develop to its full potential.
