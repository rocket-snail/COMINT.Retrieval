inter reciprocity applied to electrical networks a new
    concept inter reciprocity is introduced which is useful in the
    study of nonreciprocal networks when a particular topological
    operation termed transposition is performed on a given linear
    network the initial network and the resulting transposed
    network are said to be inter reciprocal application of the
    theory to a variety of general and special circuit problems is
    illustrated the noise properties of gyrator triode and
    transistor networks are discussed
