junction transistor trigger circuits the junction
    transistor with earthed emitter is sufficiently similar to the
    thermionic valve with earthed cathode to enable it to be used
    in conventional trigger circuits details are given of bistable
    monostable and emitter coupled trigger circuits multi vibrators
    a scale of two circuit and a blocking oscillator pulses of
    duration down to about can be produced power consumption is of
    the order of per stage
