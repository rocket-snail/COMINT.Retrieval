diurnal variations in the number of shower meteors
    detected by the forward scattering of radio waves ellipsoidal
    theory the ellipsoidal geometry inherent in the forward scatter
    process is developed fully the more rigorous results obtained
    are compared at various stages in the analysis with those given
    by the simplifying cylindrical approximation developed in part
    the potentially observable trails are first located and their
    distribution determined the fraction of these providing a
    signal exceeding some given level is found and the total number
    of these observable trails as a function of trail orientation
    is determined by integrating over the spatial distribution
