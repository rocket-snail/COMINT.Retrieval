scientific and technological progress in bulgarian
    libraries. after the socialist revolution in bulgaria in 1944,
    almost 62% of public libraries were allocated larger premises.
    5 of the central regional libraries, established as such in
    1953, moved into new buildings, while 2 other buildings were
    erected for libraries in higher education. in spite of these
    improvements, there is still a considerable shortage of space
    in libraries, which, in general, are also in need of
    modernisation. reprographic equipment, computer application and
    communication technology must not only ensure better lending
    services, including interlending, but also comprehensive
    information resources as well as a wider dissemination of
    information. like other countries, mobile libraries should
    cater for hamlets and small communities of some 1,000
    inhabitants, and also for urban populations living on new
    housing estates and/or in other areas temporarily without
    libraries. purpose-built buildings should be envisaged for e
    very library with 70,000 and more volumes. depository
    libraries, both on a national and regional level, should also
    be planned to store valuable books and rarely requested
    books.
