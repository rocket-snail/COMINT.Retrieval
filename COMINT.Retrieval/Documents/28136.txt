the research libraries are limping sadly behind-shows new
    report on the conditions of research in the public sector.
    according to a report issued in april 81 by the research
    secretariat, denmark lags behind other european countries in
    its support for research, both public and private. the report
    deals separately with research libraries and describes the
    consequences of the cuts both for libraries and their mother
    institutions; it shows that the libraries use less than 10% of
    the expenditure on research. includes comments on the report by
    the executive committee of the joint council of research
    libraries. the committee supports the conclusion that the
    research libraries' economic problems should be solved in
    conjunction with, and preferably before, any change in their
    structure and management. it points out that figures for
    running costs of research libraries under the cultural
    ministry, after adjustment, show a greater fall than of those
    under the education ministry.
