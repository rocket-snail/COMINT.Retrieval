solar rf radiation at cm wavelength the total emission at
    depends on both total area and position of sunspots the
    variation with distance of the sunspots from the centre of the
    disk is expressed by a darkening factor whose value has been
    determined directly by observing the passage of groups of spots
    and by assigning trial values and comparing the resulting value
    of total emission with observations results by the two methods
    are in agreement consideration of absorption variations to be
    expected in consequence of variations of sunspot position
    indicates that the darkening must be partly due to the change
    of geometric form of the emitting areas
