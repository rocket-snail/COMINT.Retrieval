public library cooperation as seen from a multistate
    network. cooperation among us libraries in the pacific
    northwest is of long standing and is an example of regional
    cooperation among public libraries and other libraries through
    interlibrary loan, union catalogue, union lists, cooperative
    cataloguing, and telecommunications networks between 2
    countries and over a large and sparsely populated region.
    networking has resulted in increased services to library users
    and in increased efficiencies in library operations. it has
    also introduced a whole set of new problems that must be
    discussed in the forum provided as a result of the cooperative
    arrangements and the need to extend them into the
    future.
