the nature of radiation from radiogalaxy the continuous
    optical radiation from the jet in the core of the galaxy is
    explained quantitatively by the presence of relativistic
    electrons with energies of moving in a magnetic field of
    approximately relativistic electrons with energies of diffusing
    into the galaxy are probably the source of emission
