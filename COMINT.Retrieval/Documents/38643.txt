on the theory of magnetic storms and aurorae it is shown
    that the nonmagnetic beam of ionized gas assumed in the chapman
    ferraro theory is inconsistent with cosmic ray observations and
    that the main phase of the storm cannot be explained in terms
    of a nonmagnetic beam the arguments of chapman and cowling
    against the electric field theory are discussed and shown to be
    invalid
