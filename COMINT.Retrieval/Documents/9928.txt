thermal upward flow in the ionosphere the possibility of
    atmospheric waves due to heating effects of solar radiation is
    established vertical thermal flow in the region may give rise
    to ion drift along the magnetic lines of force this may explain
    anomalous diurnal variations in the layer by applying the
    theory to observed ionospheric data for the north american zone
    estimates are obtained for the velocity of the ions and of the
    thermal flow
