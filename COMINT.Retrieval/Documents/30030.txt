absorption in an electron gas mixture the influence of
    the collision damping on the polarization of an electron gas
    mixture subjected to an alternating electric field is
    calculated using the kinetic theory of gases and assuming the
    simplest type of elastic collision the nonlinear effect of the
    absorption is estimated to a first approximation this
    nonlinearity is significant for long waves propagated in the
    ionosphere
