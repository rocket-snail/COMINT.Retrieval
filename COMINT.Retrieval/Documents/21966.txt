message extraction through estimation of relevance.
    associative retrieval strategies are especially attractive when
    a data base contains information in the form of full text and
    the collection of texts is large and changing so fast that no
    user can be familiar with its contents. the meter (message
    extraction through estimation of relevance) system was designed
    to apply such strategies effectively and inexpensively for a
    changing data base of up to 20,000 messages (texts or
    documents) of about 2,000 characters each, with new messages
    arriving at the rate of 4,000-5,000 daily. it runs on a dec
    pdp-11/45 minicomputer without special hardware, with a
    response time of about a minute for 5 simultaneous users, and
    with nearly 24 hours/day access. describes the system, its
    basic theory, and its evaluation.
