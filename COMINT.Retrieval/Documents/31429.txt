poissons partial difference equation the greens functions
    and their asymptotic behaviour for poissons partial difference
    equation in two and three dimensions are discussed and the
    distribution of potential and current in a regular grid of
    wires is calculated the method may also be applied to non
    isotropic grids and can be extended to triangular and hexagonal
    grids in two dimensions and probably to more complicated
    patterns in three dimensions
