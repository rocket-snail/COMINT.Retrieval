transistor oscillators the self oscillation conditions
    and frequency deviation characteristics of a three point
    transistor oscillator are derived by analogy with the retarding
    field oscillator and a comparison is made with measured
    characteristics of point contact and junction type transistor
    oscillators various circuits are examined from the point of
    view of suitability of application of the two types of
    transistor the discussion is limited to the frequency range
