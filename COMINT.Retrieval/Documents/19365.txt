classification of f layer storms with respect to their
    world wide distribution and characteristics part of analysis of
    available data shows that there is no correlation between f
    layer storms and sunspot activity but close correlation with
    geomagnetic storms a classification of these storms with
    respect to their distribution over the geomagnetic latitudes is
    suggested based on layer height or critical frequency
