the foundations of information science. part 3.
    quantitative aspects' objective maps and subjective landscapes.
    the metrical characteristics of information space are compared
    with those of physical space. an abstract model is used to show
    that information space is like that of landscapes and
    skyscrapers. as individuals we learn very early to correct the
    distortions that subjective appearances impose on us but traces
    of this process are shown by cosmological history. these
    arguments are supported by other evidence indicating that
    information quantities should be measured logarithmically. for
    parts 1 and 2 see 81/1828 and 81/1829. for part 4 see the
