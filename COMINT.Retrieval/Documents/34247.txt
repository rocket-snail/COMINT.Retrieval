trapped flux superconducting memory a memory cell based
    on trapped flux in superconductors has been built and tested
    the cell is constructed entirely by vacuum evaporation of thin
    films and can be selected by coincident current or by other
    techniques with drive current requirements less than the short
    transition time of the trapped flux cell indicates its possible
    use in high speed memories the superconductive film memory does
    not exhibit the problems of delta noise in core memories
    resulting from the difference in half select pulse
