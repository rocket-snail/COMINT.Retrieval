world wide diurnal variations in the f region the chief
    characteristics of the variations are described in terms of the
    sunspot minimum anomaly the sunrise anomaly and the diurnal
    range anomaly these anomalies are evaluated quantitatively and
    extracted from the observations to determine the normal curves
    the world distribution of these anomalies is studied and
    explanations are suggested variations of do not appear to be
    related either to the sunspot cycle or to the variation
