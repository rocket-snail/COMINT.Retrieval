on the earth storms some of the problems to be considered
    in studies of storms in the upper atmosphere and outer space of
    the earth are outlined stability of solar corpuscular stream
    collision with the interplanetary plasma causes the
    nonmagnetized stream to lose electrons the resulting space
    charge is neutralized by the change in density of the
    interplanetary plasma and the stream remains stable interaction
    between the solar corpuscular stream and the ezrths magnetic
    field the heating of exospheric gas caused by the compression
    of the magnetic field during the initial phase of a storm is
    not sufficient to account for the main phase the main phase
    might however result from the penetration of particles under
    the influence of a fluctuating magnetic field polar magnetic
    storms with special reference to relation between geomagnetic
    disturbances in the northern and southern auroral zones
    comparisons are made between the northern and southern zones on
    the basis of the s field patterns indices and individual
    disturbances at magnetically conjugate points the correlation
    coefficient for minute average values of disturbances at baker
    lake geomagnetic and little america geomagnetic interrelations
    among the upper atmosphere disturbance phenomena over the polar
    regions observations at syowa during the period january are
    used to examine the detailed correlations between geomagnetic
    disturbance visual aurorae and ionospheric blackouts or
    sporadic e energy and flux of corpuscular streams impinging the
    earths atmosphere an examination is made of the energy and flux
    of the corpuscular streams responsible for the ionospheric
    blackouts in the polar cap the unusual displays ad ionospheric
    effects in the auroral zone and the red aurora observed at
    lower latitudes
