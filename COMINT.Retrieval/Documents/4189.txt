practical experiences in a primary school library. hinter
    burg primary school has a library with 5,000 books and also
    records, slides, cassettes and educational films. there is no
    qualified librarian, but the teachers run the library with
    reasonable success. more money is needed for stocks, for
    expansion and because books wear out quickly. the children are
    too young to study independently there but they are actively
    encouraged to use books. all classes except the lowest have
    regular weekly instruction in the library. there is active
    cooperation with the local public library; the librarian
    advises on purchases and arranges music and story-telling
    sessions for the children. good contacts with parents and the
    local authority have also proved helpful.
