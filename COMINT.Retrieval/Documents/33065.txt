electric currents in the ionosphere part the atmospheric
    dynamo assuming semidiurnal tidal air flow the atmospheric
    dynamo problem is solved the ionosphere being divided into
    three regions each of appropriate conductivity compared with
    calculations assuming pedersen conductivity alone effective
    results give a current system similar in shape and phase though
    more intense and an electric field system markedly different an
    abnormally large east west current is found at the
    equator
