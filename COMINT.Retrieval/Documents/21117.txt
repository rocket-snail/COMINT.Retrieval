analysis of network response to periodic waves the steady
    state response of a network to a nonsinusoidal periodic wave
    may be found by applying the operational calculus method of
    waidelich of in a simplified form the method can be used for
    any linear network comprising a finite number of lumped
    elements a set of rules for obtaining the required inverse
    transforms together with a table of inverse transforms for
    square wave inputs is pe presented and explained
