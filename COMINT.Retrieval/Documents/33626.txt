height gradient of electron loss in the f region a
    theoretical expression is derived for an exponential height
    gradient of the electron loss coefficient in the f region on
    the assumption that this gradient completely accounts for
    bifurcation five models are investigated they are second power
    linear cosine parabolic and quasi parabolic distributions of
    electron density with height
