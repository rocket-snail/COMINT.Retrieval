energy losses of charged particles due to excitation of
    platma oscillations a kinetic equation is derived describing
    the interaction between beam elements and plasma under
    equilibrium conditions for non equilibrium conditions a
    nonlinear theory of plasma oscillations excited by an electron
    beam is developed and results are applied to account for the
    rapid energy transfer from the beam
