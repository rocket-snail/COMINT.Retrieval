motivation and staff development. argues that staff
    development programmes and activities do not, in themselves,
    motivate staff. they are seen as being catalytic in nature,
    needing to be understood in the context of adult learning and
    motivation theory. suggests ways of bringing about a
    renaissance in the library as a workplace which would bring the
    'quality of work life' movement to libraries. discusses
    managers' and non-managers' roles, relationships and
    responsibilities for the creation of an atmosphere conducive to
    growth, in the framework of the library development
    process.
