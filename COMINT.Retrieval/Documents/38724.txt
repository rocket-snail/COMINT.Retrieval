the theory of the anomalous k skin effect in metals for
    obliquely incident radiation the effective surface impedance of
    a metal varies with the direction of polarization of incident
    radiation in the upper visible and ultraviolet ranges formulae
    for refractive indices reflectivities and principal angles at
    oblique incidence are derived in terms of two surface
    impedances experimental results are in good agreement with the
    theory
