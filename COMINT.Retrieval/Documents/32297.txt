explicit form of f m distortion products with white noise
    modulation expressions are derived for frequency and amplitude
    distortion of the output of a network whose phase or amplitude
    characteristics vary nonlinearly with frequency the evaluation
    of these expressions using a digital computer is illustrated
    for the case of fourth order distortion associated with terms
    in the discriminator amplitude characteristic up to the sixth
    degree
