a reversible binary counter a multivibrator type counter
    performs addition or subtraction depending on application of a
    control signal to a two gate system interposed between
    consecutive counter stages the control signal may be obtained
    from a multivibrator circuit similar to the counter stages
    applications in digital analogue conversion and in an
    interpolator are discussed
