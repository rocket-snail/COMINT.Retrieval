entry of local data on oclc' the options and their impact
    on the processing of archival tapes. the oclc system allows for
    a great deal of flexibility in entering institution specific
    data for an item. in the past, policies for entering local data
    have been formulated in many libraries on the basis of
    catalogue card appearance, but the increasing use of oclc tape
    products requires reexamination of many of the local data
    practices now in use. a survey was conducted by the
    bibliographical center for research in order to determine the
    extent of variations for entering local data on the part of bcr
    oclc libraries. the results are presented here, along with a
    discussion of alternative practices and their impact on the
    processing of oclc tapes.
