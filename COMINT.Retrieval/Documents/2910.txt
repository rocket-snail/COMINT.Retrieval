the effect of radar wavelength on meteor echo rate theory
    is given which includes the effects of high electron density
    the linear rate of trail formation and the initial column
    radius on the meteor echo power and hence on the number of
    echoes received the theories of lovell and clegg of and others
    are discussed critically a comparison with experimental results
    is made
