the development and significance of the core curriculum
    in archives, library and information studies. (phd thesis.) an
    attempt to identify the common ground between archives,
    library, and information studies from which a core curriculum
    could be derived for the professionals in the 3 fields. the
    underlying concept is that the 3 fields must be viewed as a
    whole within the information spectrum. the historical
    development of librarianship; early library education in the
    uk, usa, and brazil; present and future trends towards
    participation in information networks and systems; and likely
    manpower requirements are all taken into account. current
    general education trends are also considered.
