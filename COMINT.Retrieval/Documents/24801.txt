online government documents data base searching and the
    use of microfiche documents online by academic and public
    depository librarians. reports findings related to academic and
    public depository librarians' use of on-line data base
    searching and microfiche government documents on-line. overall,
    the data suggest that depository librarians are involved in
    little on-line data base searching of government document data
    bases, have limited access to on-line terminals, have received
    little training in the use of data bases, and acquire virtually
    no microformatted government publications on-line. these and
    other findings are discussed, factors that encourage and limit
    the use of on-line services in a depository library are
    presented, and recommendations are made to increase depository
    librarians' use of government document data bases and access to
    microfiche government documents on-line.
