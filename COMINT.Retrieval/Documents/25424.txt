the origin of ferromagnetism in transition metals
    analysis of experimental evidence indicates that the energy
    band concept constitutes a more satisfactory basis for the
    theory of ferro magnetism than the hypothesis that the magnetic
    carriers are bound to individual atoms the occurrence of
    fractional number of carriers is explained on the basis of
    close range interactions between carriers associated with the
    same atom the absence of ferromagnetism in heavy elements such
    as a consequence of strong spin orbit coupling
