dimensional relations in magnetohydro dynamics an
    analysis is made of dimensional relations characteristic of
    phenomena in fluids in the absence of instabilities conditions
    favourable for accelerating particles to the higher cosmic ray
    energies can exist only when the linear dimensions fo the fluid
    are very large
