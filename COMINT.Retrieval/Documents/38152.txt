nonstationary parametrons to eliminate the necessity for
    the critical adjustment of amplitude and phase of the
    excitation current dc controlled and diode controlled
    parametrons were investigated a fast decay time was achieved
    with diode control resulting in a high speed of operation in
    logic circuits
