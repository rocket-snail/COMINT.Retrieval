the repair workshop of hamburg state and university
    library. founded in 1960, the workshop was 1st concerned mainly
    with bookbinding; a few years later a separate section was
    opened for document preservation and restoration of papyri and
    other manuscripts. total estimates for damaged material in the
    early 1960s were over 422,000 dm, a sum which at that time
    could not be met. the floods of 1962 in hamburg caused
    particular problems. since 1978 extra financial help has come
    from the volkswagen foundation. the work is not only expensive
    but also exceptionally time-consuming. the workshop is involved
    in exhibitions, training courses for library students and
    national and international conferences; a collection of subject
    literature has also been developed.
