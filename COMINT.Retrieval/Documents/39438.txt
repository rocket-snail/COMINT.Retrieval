measurements of wind in the upper atmosphere by means of
    drifting meteor trails part results of measurements made during
    oct dec by the method described in above are discussed winds at
    heights between and are in general horizontal with a prevailing
    direction in october towards the north east and in november and
    december towards the east the hour and hour harmonic components
    represent anti clockwise rotation of the wind vectors the hour
    component being consistent with the phase of a semi diurnal
    tidal wind as deduced from barometric oscillations over the
    height range investigated the direction of the wind remains the
    same but the mean velocity increases with height
