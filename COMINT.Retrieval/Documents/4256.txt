the organisation and methods of planning research work in
    the m.e. saltykov-shchedrin state public library. adequate
    planning is a necessary pre-requisite of all research work.
    planning for library research follows the same guidelines as
    other government planning, taking into account political
    commitment, relevance, continuity and purposiveness. 1st, a
    list of the most important problems over the next 20 years is
    drawn up; then a 5-year plan is worked out to concentrate on
    the most immediate of these problems; then a yearly plan is
    drawn up to implement the 5-year plan. examples of such a
    programme in operation can be seen in the research work of the
    saltykov-shchedrin state public library.
