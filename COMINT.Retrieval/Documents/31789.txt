ionospheric reflection coefficients at vlf from sferics
    measurements the magnitude of the ionospheric reflection
    coefficient as a function of ff frequency is calculated from
    individual spectral analysis of the ground wave and the once
    reflected sky wave results are compared with those obtained
    using an ionospheric model the success of the method depends
    upon the accurate location of the source and the correct
    selection of strokes which contain only appreciable vertical
    currents in the discharge column
