longitudinal plasma oscillations part the equations
    derived in part are applied to the investigation of the
    dispersive properties of the plasma for the case of hf
    oscillations lf oscillations and high electron drift velocities
    results show that in the propagation of longitudinal waves in
    discharge tubes the motion of ions is frequently of importance
    formulae are derived for the dependence of the space
    periodicity and the damping coefficient on the discharge
    parameters
