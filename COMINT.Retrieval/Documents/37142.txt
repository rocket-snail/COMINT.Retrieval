classification of documentation on gluing and glues using
    udc. practical recommendations. classification of literature
    containing information on glues and gluing is a difficult task
    as there are several classes within the udc system with almost
    identical meaning. the scientific research institute for
    technical and economical investigations in chemistry carried
    out an analysis of the udc classes available for classification
    of glues and gluing processes and prepared recommendations on
    how to use the udc system for classification of glues and
    gluing. the recommendations are presented.
