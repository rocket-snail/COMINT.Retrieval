new analysis of the polarization of radiation and the
    faraday effect in terms of complex vectors the properties of
    the polarization ellipse are deduced in terms of the ratio of
    the cartesian components of the complex electric vector of a
    beam of radiation by utilizing the argand representation of a
    real two dimensional vector as a complex number the two
    components of a beam that are accepted and rejected by a
    polarizer or a radio antenna are considered as orthogonal
    components in the directions of two complex orthonormal vectors
    the intensities of the corresponding components of a polarized
    beam are derived and represented on the poincare sphere the
    methods are then applied to the important radio case of the
    faraday effect in a uniform magneto ionic medium finally the
    measurable quantities characterizing a beam of partially
    polarized radiation are obtained from a diagonalization of the
    complex polarization tensor that specifies the beam
