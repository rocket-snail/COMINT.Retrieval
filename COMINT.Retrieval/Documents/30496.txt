catalogue of power law and tchebycheff type filter up to
    order four table give the circuit diagrams and the normalized
    values of the circuit elements in maximally flat response and
    tchebycheff type filters terminated and with a short or open
    circuit at one end for different values of the pass band
    reflection coefficient corresponding attenuation
    characteristics are given in diagrams the application of the
    tables is illustrated in five numerical examples
