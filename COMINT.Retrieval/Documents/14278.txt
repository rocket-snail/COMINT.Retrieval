a wide band voltage controlled swept frequency rc
    oscillator oscillators based on the principle of parallel
    network tuning are examined new equipment using this principle
    is described in detail frequency variations can be restricted
    to any limits in the range and the maximum duration of the
    sweep cycle can be varied from to min
