irregularities in atmospheric densities deduced from
    satellite observations results of observations of atmospheric
    drag on satellites indicate a pronounced diurnal bulge lagging
    behind the subsolar point erratic fluctuations of the
    atmosphere above due to solar radiation and irregular
    perturbations of the upper atmosphere associated with magnetic
