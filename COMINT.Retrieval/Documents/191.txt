systematic indexing of the 2union catalogue of austrian
    theses1. the 2union catalogue of austrian theses1 appears
    annually and lists all approved theses from austrian
    universities and polytechnics. since its inception in 1966
    until 1975 the subject index was constructed from keywords in
    the titles, but as from 1976 a specially designed systematic
    subject classification has been in use. it is to some extent
    based upon that in use at vienna's university and polytechnic,
    and the new method of selecting and standardising subject
    headings is described. there are also indexes of personal names
    (as subjects of theses, not authors), and place names. indexing
    is done manually, computerised indexing being too expensive.
    cumulations will be made, the 1st for the period
    1976-86.
