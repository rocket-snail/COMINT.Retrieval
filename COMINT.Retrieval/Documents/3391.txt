an extension of townsends approximation formula for
    ionization in a homogeneous electric field the use of an
    additional parameter improves the approximation and extends the
    range of validity for lower field strengths a general
    approximation formula is proposed for ionization dependent
    simultaneously on both field strength and voltage
