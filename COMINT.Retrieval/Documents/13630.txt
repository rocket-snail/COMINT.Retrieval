subject heading list. the present finnish subject heading
    list dates from 1941. a subject heading pilot working group set
    up by the finnish library association has completed its pilot
    survey. the group included librarians from different types of
    libraries. the purposes of the pilot was to recommend that a
    compilation of a subject heading list should be carried out and
    to provide financial justification for the work. the list would
    serve all types of libraries and would be more flexible than a
    classification. a thesaurus structure would be best for the
    purpose. the list should include between 10,000 and 20,000
    terms. a working group should be set up by the ministry of
    education this year. the budget for the work lasting 3 years is
    estimated at 385,000 finn marks.
