on an equation connected with the theory of triode
    oscillations detailed discussion of the periodic solutions of
    the differential equation in which the parameter is small the
    equation is concerned with the forced oscillations in a simple
    electrical circuit containing a triode van der pol has treated
    the case where and an extensive theory of triode oscillations
    has been built up for this case in practice however the graph
    of has a much flatter bottom than that of the function and
    cartwright of and of has raised the question whether this
    flattening will alter the performance of the circuit near
    resonance the main part of this paper is an attempt to answer
    this question an estimate is made of the permissible degree of
    flattening of the curve without the detuning diagram losing any
    of its significant properties various pertinent theorems are
    established and the possible periodic solutions of the equation
    are discussed in relation to the detuning diagram particular
    results include the following a if k is small enough and the
    value of lies in a certain small range near forced oscillations
    with half the applied frequency are possible two of these have
    amplitudes very large compared with that of the applied emf one
    mode being stable and the other unstable only when the graph of
    is asymmetrical can there be an appreciable range of values of
    for which subharmonic oscillations of order take place
