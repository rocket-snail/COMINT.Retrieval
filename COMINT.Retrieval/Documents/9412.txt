long duration echoes from aurora meteors and ionospheric
    back scatter a report of radar echoes of unusual types observed
    in the course of the ottawa meteor research programme pulses
    with a peak power of were radiated on a frequency of some of
    the echoes were correlated with visual observations of aurora
    the extremely long duration min to over min of some meteor
    echoes was probably caused by abnormal ionospheric conditions
    weak semipermanent echoes duration up to or over hour are
    attributed to reflection at vertical or near vertical incidence
    from irregularities in the lower ionosphere possibly the same
    as those responsible for the long range propagation reported by
