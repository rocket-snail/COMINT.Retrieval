optical electromagnetic and satellite observations of
    high altitude nuclear detonations part after each of the high
    altitude detonations in the argus experiment visual auroras
    were observed in the detonation area after the third event an
    aurora was observed in the conjugate area after the second and
    third events signals attributed to hydromagnetic waves were
    detected in the conjugate region these signals had a
    periodicity of about cs the maximum change in the magnetic
    field was about gamma io propagated along the magnetic line of
    force the velocity was about km sec sporadic e was observed
    after the third event in the conjugate area comparative records
    of the and lines were obtained in the detonation area
