the application of some semiconductors as logarithmic
    elements voltage dividers incorporating rectifiers to give
    special characteristics were described by kallmann of for
    circuits involving high resistances rectifiers made from other
    semiconductors may be more suitable logarithmic characteristics
    obtained using various semiconductor rectifiers are presented
    temperature compensation is achieved by use of negative
    temperature coefficient resistors the logarithmic response has
    been obtained at frequencies up to
