miniature lacquer film capacitors a manufacturing process
    is described in which a thin film is cast on a supporting base
    and is metallized and slit while still supported after which it
    is stripped and wound into capacitor units metallized films
    thick have been produced the resulting capacitors are about a
    seventh the size of the smallest metallized paper types the
    support may be left in if the f lm is extremely fragile or if
    the capacitor is to operate at voltages below about a formula
    is derived for the effective series resistance
