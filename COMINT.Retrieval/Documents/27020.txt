governments come and go-ala remains. describes the
    american library association. it was founded in 1876 and has
    35,000 members in the usa and canada. its members are mainly
    individual librarians, but also library committee members,
    authors and publishers. its publications illustrate the wide
    coverage of its activities' cataloguing rules, library
    planning, education, automation, pr material. it does not act
    as a traditional trade union, but the pressure on its office
    for library personnel resources to take up the matter of
    unequal pay is strong, especially from younger women, and the
    office is now publishing annual surveys of salaries. in line
    with this, the ala is boycotting states who have not ratified
    the equal rights amendment, a decision which has caused
    friction in the association. although the reagan administration
    has meant cuts for libraries, the ala is confident that it can
    ride the storm.
