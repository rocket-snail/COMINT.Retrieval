the alternatives of the 80s. report on a conference on
    the structural change of the public library, organised by the
    swedish library association and held in sept 81. the conference
    discussed' the need for a change of the physical structure of
    libraries; need for structural change of the library's internal
    activities and administration; and need for change of
    attitudes. the importance of permanent library premises was
    stressed. the main points of the cultural council's handbook'
    2public library premises1 were outlined. it operates with
    suggestions for 3 types of main library, with well developed
    information activities centred in an 'information zone'.
    prefabricated, transportable 'culture kiosks' were put forward
    as an alternative to branches and mobiles. it was argued, with
    reference to the project channel 2000, a teledata based
    information system used by columbus public library, ohio, that
    public libraries should welcome telecommunication. on the other
    hand, we must also be conscious of a loss of human
    contact.
