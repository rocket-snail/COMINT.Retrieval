asymptotic formulas for diffraction by parabolic surfaces
    asymptotic solutions to the wave equation are found at a
    boundary consisting of a paraboloid of revolution or a
    parabolic cylinder the results are applied to the reflection at
    such surfaces of incoming plane waves or divergent waves from a
    point or line on the axis of the surface
