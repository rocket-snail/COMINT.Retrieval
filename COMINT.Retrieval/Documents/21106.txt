coaxial cavity tuning element for uhf the design is
    described of a unit which can be used in television tuners and
    test instruments for the band the unit consists essentially of
    a metal cylinder with an axial conductor having a gap at the
    centre to form a variable capacitor for tuning an accurately
    machined low loss dielectric tube separates core and cylinder
    and serves as a close fitting guide for the tuning plunger
    applications of the unit in a signal generator a frequency
    sweep generator a wavemeter and a grid dip meter are described
    briefly
