dynamo currents and conductivities in the earths upper
    atmosphere discussion of the results of rocket measurements
    reported previously of the observed current system would
    account for the exceptionally large geomagnetic diurnal
    variations found at huancayo and strongly supports balfour
    stewarts dynamo theory of the diurnal variations by taking
    account of polarization due to the hall effect the large
    discrepancy between conventionally calculated ionosphere
    conductivities and the value of the conductivity required by
    the dynamo theory using accepted values for the velocity of
    high altitude winds can be eliminated further rocket
    measurements on both magnetically quiet and disturbed days are
    very desirable
