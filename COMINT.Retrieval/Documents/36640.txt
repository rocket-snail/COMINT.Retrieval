will the state take the financial backbone out of the
    library act?. state grants to the vest-agder (norway) county
    library amounted in 1980 to 35% of its budget. recent proposals
    by the juel committee on local government reform would mean the
    withdrawal of state support. if responsibility for library
    service devolves entirely on local authorities, the norwegian
    public library system will be threatened by disintegration,
    with national library duties concentrated in a few state-owned
    special libraries. since even the revised library act of 1971
    did not oblige counties to operate a library service, the
    system has been established and developed largely through the
    influence and support of central authority. the basis for the
    1971 act was the long-standing regional imbalance in school
    library and public library standards. under the new proposals,
    libraries in the most deprived areas would be in most danger,
    and cultural activity as a whole would be vulnerable to
    political motivation.
