some significant results of current classification
    research in india. contribution to a section on current trends
    in classification research. based on the paper 'a general
    theory of sil, popsi and classaurus', submitted for discussion
    at the international classification research forum,
    minneapolis, oct 79. a brief account of 3 indian classification
    research contributions. a general theory of subject indexing
    language (sil) has been developed through logical abstraction
    of the structures of outstanding sils. the language of
    postulate-based permuted subject indexing (popsi) has been
    developed through the interpretation of the structure of sils
    forming part of the general theory. the classaurus has also
    been formulated; this is a faceted systematic scheme of
    hierarchical classification having all the necessary attributes
    of a conventional thesaurus, excluding the numeration of other
    related terms and is especially meant to facilitate the use of
    popsi.
