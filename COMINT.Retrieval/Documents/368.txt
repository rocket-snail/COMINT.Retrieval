geomagnetism this special number commemorates the golden
    jubilee of the alibag observatory the papers presented include
    the following the contrast between geomagnetic s and l at
    huancayo characteristics of polar magnetic storms ionospheric
    magnetic fields during marked decreases in cosmic rays
    magnetohydrodynamic waves and solar prominences auroral
    activity at medium latitudes solar radiation in the far
    ultraviolet and some related geophysical phenomena on the
    emission of electric currents from the sun sunspots and
    geomagnetic variation magnetic storms and solar m regions the
    dynamo action of the diurnal atmospheric oscillation recurrence
    tendency of geomagnetic activity during the current sunspot
    minimum some remarks on the equatorial electrojet as revealed
    by the analysis of solar flare effects geomagnetic records at
    colaba and alibag on days of solar eclipse some others are
    abstracted individually
