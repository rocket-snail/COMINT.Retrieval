the german experience' a case study in library promotion.
    paper presented at the conference promoting and publicising
    library and information services, london, aslib, 16 mar 81.
    during recent years the most apparent contributions to west
    german library public relations were some approaches towards a
    corporate visual identity for a public library system. colour
    slides illustrated the graphic conceptions developed for and
    consequently applied by the municipal libraries of cologne and
    wuppertal as well as a more recent project undertaken by the
    german library institute and financed by a government grant.
    indicates the wide range of materials to be considered.
    stresses that any graphic contributions should be seen in
    context with other single aspects of library public relations
    and must also be based on an integrated pr policy in line with
    a library's goals and objectives and the image desired.
