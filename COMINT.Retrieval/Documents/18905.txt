aids unlimited' the scope for machine aids in a large
    organization. paper presented at the aslib technical
    translation group conference, london, 20 nov 80. examines the
    types of machine aid which are suitable for use in a large
    translating operation such as those met in the european
    community institutions. reviews the way in which these machine
    aids are already being used in large organisations and examines
    the areas in which they can be of benefit to the running of the
    whole organisation. warns of possible difficulties in
    introducing them. if these difficulties can be overcome, many
    advantages can be gained in a large organisation by introducing
    a fully-integrated word-processing system in which all texts
    are stored in electronic archives and can be transmitted
    electronically from 1 work station to another, and from 1
    country to another.
