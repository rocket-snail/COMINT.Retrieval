implementation of process management for a secure
    archival storage system. this thesis presents an implementation
    of process management for a security kernel based secure
    archival storage system (sass). the implementation is based on
    a family of secure, distributed, multi-microprocessor operating
    systems designed to provide multilevel internal security and
    controlled sharing of data among authorised users.
