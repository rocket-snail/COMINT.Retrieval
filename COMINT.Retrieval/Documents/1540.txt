widespread diurnal variations of effective slope of the
    ionosphere measurements have been made at seagrove radio
    research station nz of the bearing and elevation angles of
    signals received on from nandi fiji distant almost magnetically
    north and on from brisbane queensland distant almost
    magnetically west from these measurements the effective slopes
    of the ionosphere are found to be related at places about apart
    and the average diurnal variation of these slopes is
    determined
