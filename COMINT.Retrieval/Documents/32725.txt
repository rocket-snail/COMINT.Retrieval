the size effect of ferrite spheres the integral equation
    technique is used to derive an approximate formula for the
    apparent susceptibility of a small ferrite sphere within a
    microwave cavity using a variational principle a first order
    estimate is obtained for the effect of a plane wall and the
    effect of the size of the sphere
