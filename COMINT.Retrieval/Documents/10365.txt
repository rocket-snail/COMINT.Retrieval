the canadian public archives and the report entitled the
    future of the national library of canada. a slightly condensed
    version of a paper presented at the 9th annual congress of the
    quebec archivists' association, by a member of the committee
    established by the canadian public archives to reply to the
    national library report of 1979. deals with the recommendations
    made for transferring maps, manuscripts and music from the
    public archives to the national library, insisting on the
    retention of the division of material between the 2
    institutions according to physical form, not subject matter.
    shows how the present arrangement came into being by intention,
    not accident; the unnecessary expense involved in creating an
    archive section at the national library; and the irrelevance of
    foreign models to the canadian situation. reference is made to
    the legislation currently in force, and the national library
    recommendations finally dismissed as impractical and
    ill-conceived.
