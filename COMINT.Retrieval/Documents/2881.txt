we'll meet in sindelfingen. sindelfingen, the venue of
    the 1982 conference of the association of librarians in public
    libraries has a population of 56,000. in recent years a large
    increase in industrial development has resulted in a need for
    the rapid and improved provision of schools, libraries and
    other public facilities. the 1st public library opened here in
    1909; the present building was opened in 1970, partly financed
    by the daimler benz company. in 1980 national library
    statistics revealed that sindelfingen has the highest
    purchasing budget among libraries of comparable size' 5.70 dm
    per inhabitant, with a stock size of 2.6 media units per
    inhabitant. the multi-purpose building also houses art
    exhibitions, a communal cinema and facilities for theatrical
    performances and public meetings.
