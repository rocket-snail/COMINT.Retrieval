piezoelectric oscillations of quartz plates at even and
    half odd harmonics a number of quartz plates of different
    dimensions were plated with ag al or cu by various methods and
    tested in the same circuit results show that a quartz plate has
    preferred modes of oscillation at the odd and even harmonic and
    at frequencies mid way between these though the amplitude of
    the odd harmonics is very much the greater
