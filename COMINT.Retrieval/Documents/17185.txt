reflection of an electromagnetic wave from a plasma
    moving through a dielectric in a constant magnetic field
    mathematical treatment of the reflection of a retarded e m wave
    from a moving plasma in a magnetic field directed parallel to
    the plasma motion expressions are derived for the frequency and
    amplitude of the reflected wave the dependence of phase
    velocity on magnetic field intensity is determined and two
    refracted waves are defined
