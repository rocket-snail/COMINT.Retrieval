    servants and politicians, and civil servants' right of free
    expression. a survey of library development in denmark since
    1909 was given by librarians. r. lysholt hansen was resigned to
    the fact that the research libraries did not wish to enter into

    resource distribution should be found. the final subject of
    discussion was' provision and management in the libraries of
    tomorrow, when the right balance between centralisation,
    necessary in a time of cuts, and individuality was
    debated.
