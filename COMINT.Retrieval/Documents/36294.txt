a theory of scattering by nonisotropic irregularities
    with application to radar reflections from the aurora the
    existence and aspect sensitivity of auroral echoes can be
    explained as back scatter from nonisotropic columns of
    ionization parallel to the earths magnetic field of length
    about and diameter caused by turbulence in an region having a
    maximum electron density about times the normal value but the
    theory fails to explain the rapid fading rates associated with
    auroral echoes
