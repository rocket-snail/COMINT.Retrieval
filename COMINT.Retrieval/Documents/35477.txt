observations on the ionospheric f layer at night the law
    of electron loss in the f layer at night electrons in the f
    layer are lost by attachment like processes the loss
    coefficients are of the form where is the height at which and
    is the scale height of the loss coefficient assuming the loss
    coefficients are attributable to loss rates in chemical
    processes values correspond to those of molecular oxygen and
    nitrogen
