the band pass distributed amplifier general expressions
    are derived for the gain of a distributed amplifier with any
    number of valves coupled by identical filter sections the
    analysis indicates that reduction of band edge peaks is more
    difficult for band pass than for low pass amplifiers choice of
    suitable filter networks for the band pass case is discussed
    and some experimental results are presented for a valve
    amplifier with a pass band from to
