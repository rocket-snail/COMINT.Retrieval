information theory and scientific communication. informal
    and formal communication processes are documented in the
    primary journal literature. both processes impose structures on
    the authors who publish their research, and the formal process
    imposes a structure on the journals which publish scientific
    papers. it is shown that information theory can be applied to
    these structures to evaluate author and journal contributions
    to the communication of scientific information. experimental
    results identify the most communicative authors and journals in
    an area of active research.
