the theory and design of coaxial resistor mounts for the
    frequency band a design is described in which the resistive
    inner conductor has uniform diameter while the outer conductor
    has a tractrix profile lead in cones are designed to avoid
    discontinuity at the connections experimental results indicate
    that the impedance is within of the resistance with an
    extremely small phase angle at all frequencies up to the
    highest measured namely
