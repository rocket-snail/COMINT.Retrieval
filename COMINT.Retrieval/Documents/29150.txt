requirements for establishing a regional information
    nucleus in north east brazil. to demonstrate the problems of
    establishing a regional information network, the existing
    information resources in brazil's northeast were investigated.
    data obtained from the 2brazilian statistical annual1 and the
    brazilian 2national union catalogue of periodicals1 showed that
    compared to other regions, although relatively well endowed
    with libraries, the northeast is inadequately supplied with
    periodicals, and that the majority of collections are
    incomplete or duplicated. a planned acquisition programme for
    serials, backed by an organised interlibrary loan policy, is
    recommended, together with investigations to establish user
    needs and periodical usage, as essential preliminaries for
    network planning.
