proceedings of the ibis/pcrc conference' legal and
    financial aspects of publishing. this conference was organised
    following the publication of blrd report 5485 (see 81/3758) by
    the primary communications research centre. the conference was
    aimed at the smaller publisher and its purpose was to provide a
    practical introduction to some of the legal and financial
    aspects of book publishing. copyright, contracts and the
    pricing of publications were areas which were given particular
    attention, and in the discussion periods following each paper
    there were opportunities to widen the scope and to raise
    problems of a very practical nature; in a concluding paper some
    consideration was given to the future prospects of the small
    publisher.
