aerial smoothing in radio astronomy theoretical
    considerations show that the aerial does not register those
    spatial fourier components of the true distribution of radio
    brightness having frequencies beyond a cut off determined by
    the aerial p aperture components of lower frequency are
    registered but their relative strengths are altered the
    consequences are that there are invisible distributions which
    produce no response when scanned by the aerial and in
    conducting a survey the measuring points must be closer
    together than half the period of the fourier component at cut
    off
