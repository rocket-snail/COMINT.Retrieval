the growth f of an electron avalanche retarded by its own
    space charge the calculation presented shows how the ionization
    coefficient and the total multiplication in the avalanche vary
    with the distance travelled when the positive ions formed have
    an appreciable effect the time taken for an avalanche to
    develop is also calculated the cases of constant field at
    electrodes and constant potential between them are considered
    assuming plane parallel geometry
