children are the losers-they do not learn the habit of
    using the library. the report of the chairman of the danish
    school library association to the annual meeting held in oct
    81. would like to see education committee members better
    informed about the work of school libraries and their place in
    the schools. the training of school librarians at the danish
    teachers' high school has suffered from cuts and standards have
    been lowered. comments on the latest proposal for a library
    bill and criticises the decision to place school libraries
    under the schools act. if they are to be transferred to the
    schools act they should at least have their own by-laws
    stipulating cooperation with public libraries and an
    independent budget. the proposal does not allow for these.
    discusses a new constitution for the association and argues for
    the continued need for separate associations for children's
    libraries and school libraries, but with close
    cooperation.
