poetry at buffalo: the twentieth century collection. the
    twentieth century collection at the state university of new
    york at buffalo was started by charles abbott in 1935 as a
    workshop where poems in all stages from conception to
    completion (worksheets are included) could be studied and the
    creative process analysed. he toured the usa, urging poets to
    contribute material and visit the collection. the collection
    new comprises 64,500 volumes, 780 phonorecords, 400 tapes of
    authors reading their own work, and 2,450 sets of small
    magazines and periodicals (which are often the 1st, and
    sometimes only, showcase for a poet's work). notable holdings
    are the large amounts of material on william carlos williams,
    james joyce, robert graves, and dylan thomas.
