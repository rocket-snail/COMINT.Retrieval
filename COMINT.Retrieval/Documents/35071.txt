future development of libraries' the organisational and
    policy framework. undertaken as a preliminary to a wider
    examination of future library development in the uk, this study
    of the organisational and policy framework within which
    libraries of all kinds will be able to cooperate efficiently in
    a coordinated library service gives particular attention to the
    roles of central government institutions and the library
    advisory council. the report reviews the extent of existing
    central and local government responsibilities for library and
    information services, discusses the problems of coordination
    and policy making, identifies possible frameworks for a
    coordinated service, and concludes with specific
    recommendations. report not available from ntis.
