more technical journals are required in libraries.
    scientific libraries cannot subscribe to all the technical
    journals available. public libraries must participate in this.
    the central library for technology uses surveys of reference
    use, interlending and lending in general to assist in the
    selection of titles. selected lists of titles for 4 categories
    of user are given' amateur, amateur and expert, expert, and
    foreign language journals for the amateur. finnish technical
    journals are not well indexed but attempts are being made to
    improve them.
