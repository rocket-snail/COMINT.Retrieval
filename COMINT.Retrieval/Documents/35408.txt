electron density in the upper atmosphere and
    interpretation of the curves of ionosphere virtual height part
    a calculation is made of the optical path of a wave reflected
    by a chapman layer with a semithickness where h is the scale
    height comparison of the results with those obtained previously
    indicates that the lower half of such a layer is closely
    approximated by a parabolic layer of semithickness the electron
    density distribution is investigated for regions of
    superposition of the f and true f layers taking recombination
    into account the linear superposition formula used previously
    is found to be inadequate and is replaced by the formula where
    n and n are the independent densities of the f and true f
    layers
