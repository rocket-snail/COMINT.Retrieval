minicomputers and available packages. developments in the
    computer field in recent years are described with particular
    emphasis on the facilities available for the mechanisation of
    library and information tasks. with the development of
    minicomputers a new era opened up for information workers but a
    major problem had to be overcome, namely the lack of suitable
    software to provide those facilities. following the
    introduction of ibm's stairs program for information storage
    and retrieval on a large mainframe computer, similar programs
    soon became available for use on the range of minicomputers
    which had started to penetrate the market. many were specially
    commissioned for library and information use; discusses cairs
    and status. a major breakthrough came with the introduction of
    word processors, particularly the programmable shared logic
    systems. manufacturers started to produce specific software
    packages, including information storage and retrieval programs,
    for this type of equipment. examples of relevant hardware and
    software and various applications are given.
