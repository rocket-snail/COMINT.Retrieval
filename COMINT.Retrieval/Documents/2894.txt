systematic investigations of the influence of geomagnetic
    activity on the nocturnal critical frequencies of the layer
    results of a statistical analysis of data covering a period of
    years are presented graphically the probability that a
    geomagnetic activity index of magnitude determined over a
    period is followed by an ionospheric storm is in the summer of
    a sunspot maximum year and in winter the corresponding figures
    for a index in a sunspot minimum year are respectively
