how to design bistable multivibrators the design
    procedure described is intended to ensure reliable operation in
    spite of deviations of resistors from nominal values variations
    of supply voltage and deterioration of valve cathode emission
    formulae are given for determining th appropriate values of
    coupling capacitance triggering networks for dealing with
    pulses of different amplitude and duration are shown
