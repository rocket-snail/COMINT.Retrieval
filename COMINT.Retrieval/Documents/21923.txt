the conception and birth pangs of oclc-an account of the
    struggles of the formative years. in 1951 a small group of head
    librarians from 1 municipal and several private colleges got
    together to cooperate among themselves to improve their
    resources and services. they were soon joined by others,
    including their counterparts in the largest state-assisted and
    private universities in ohio. it required the strenuous, often
    agonizing efforts of academic librarians and college
    presidents, working through the ohio library association and
    the ohio college association, to conceive and deliver the ohio
    college library center (oclc inc.) in 1967.
