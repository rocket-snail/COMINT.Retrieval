oclc search key usage in a large research library. many
    libraries use the oclc online union catalog and shared
    cataloging subsystem to perform various library functions, such
    as acquisitions and cataloguing. as an initial part of the
    operation, users must search and retrieve a bibliographic
    record for an item from the large oclc data base. various types
    of derived search key are available for retrieval. this study
    of actual search keys entered by on-line users of oclc was
    conducted to determine the types of search key users prefer for
    performing various library operations and to find out whether
    the preferred search keys are effective.
