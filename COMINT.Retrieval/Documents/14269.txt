on the use of gram charlier series ot represent noise the
    stochastic time series produced by the random occurrence of
    identical events is considered if the waveforms corresponding
    to the individual events and to the resulting autocorrelation
    function and power spectrum are each represented by a gram
    charlier series relatively simple relations exist between the
    different sequences of coefficients if the noise bandwidth is
    not too great the number of terms in the series is small enough
    to permit computation the formulae are applied to the analysis
    of experimental data for noise associated with reverse current
    in a si diode
