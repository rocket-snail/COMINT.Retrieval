f layer regularities at ibadan analysis of records for
    the period december january confirms that the daily variation
    of n the total electron content in a column of unit cross
    section below the height of maximum ionization in the f layer
    is relatively free from anomalies exhibited by the
    corresponding variation of n the maximum electron density of
    the f layer in calculating n the non parabolic electron
    distribution at ibadan must be taken into account inclusion of
    the f layer electron contribution has no appreciable effect on
    the regularity of the daily variation a new method is described
    for deducing the recombination coefficient and the rate of ion
    production from the variation of n the phenomenon of sunset
    minimum of is discussed reasons are given for considering it a
    spurious effect arising from errors in the reduction of
    records
