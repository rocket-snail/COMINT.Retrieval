american libraries for the blind are also worried about
    cuts. describes, with figures, the present library services for
    the blind in the usa. the services are coordinated by the
    national library service for the blind and physically
    handicapped under the library of congress (nls). nls produces
    catalogues, pr material, and a manual, and provides
    consultants. it undertakes all selection of material to be
    transferred to braille print, flexible discs or, mostly, to 4
    track cassette tapes. these are issued mainly by post through
    the 56 regional libraries and their 102 branches. some regional
    libraries also organise recordings of local material by
    volunteers, but the one in new york has had to curtail its
    services. 4 multi-state centres act as service centres for the
    regional libraries. private library services to the blind
    include' recordings for the blind, the jewish guild for the
    blind's cassette library, and the radio reading service; all
    use volunteer readers and provide services free.
