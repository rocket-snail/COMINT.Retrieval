thoughts on the use of teletext in librarianship.
    teletext (bildschirmtext) was 1st shown to the german public by
    the federal postal services in 1977. a comparison is made
    between teletext, video text and 2-way cable television.
    teletext is particularly useful in libraries; the equipment can
    be used directly by readers and information can be obtained
    from it at any time. since teletext is a text medium for the
    speedy provision of topical information it presents no threat
    to the book, a medium for reading. teletext is also useful in
    library request and loan procedures and its use can be
    implemented in stages, resulting in the reduction of costs for
    work procedures and information provision. teletext contains
    fewer errors than printed material.
