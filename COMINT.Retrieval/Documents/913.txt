implifications of holography for information systems. the
    advantages of using holography for information storage and
    other applications are presented. the advantages are higher
    storage capacity than semiconductor memories, bubble memories;
    utilisation for character recognition; 3-dimensional
    projection; television discs; colour reproduction; ability to
    combine with other technologies such as optical fibres,
    videodisc; reference; and file security systems.
