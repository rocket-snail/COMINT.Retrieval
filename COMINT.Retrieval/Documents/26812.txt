possible transmission of electromagnetic waves through a
    metal in a strong magnetic field analysis shows that an em wave
    propagating along a magnetic field can penetrate a metal plate
    perpendicular to the field if the larmor frequency is higher
    than the frequency of the wave and much higher than the
    collision frequency and if the larmor electron radius is
    smaller than the wave length in the metal
