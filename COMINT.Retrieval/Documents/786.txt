publishing in library science journals' a test of the
    olsgaard profile. as a test of the olsgaard profile of
    authorship characteristics in academic library journals, the
    gender, geographic location and occupation of authors
    contributing to 5 journals of interest to special librarians
    were analysed. resulting data provided the basis for the
    construction of a profile of authorship characteristics in
    special library journals. the profile is compared to the
    olsgaard profile. indicates that while female authors are
    consistently underrepresented in library science literature,
    they are published in greater proportion in special library
    periodicals than in the academic library periodicals sampled by
    the olsgaards. essentially confirms the olsgaards' findings on
    geographic distribution and occupation of authors in library
    periodicals.
