design theory of optimum negative resistance amplifiers
    an examination is made of amplifiers obtained by imbedding a
    linear active one port device in arbitrary three port devices
    the optimum gain bandwidth formula synthesis procedure and
    design curves are given for this and other amplifier
    configurations
