eitaromcoated spheres in the region of the first
    resonance calculations based on methods developed previously
    indicate that a dielectric coated conducting sphere can be made
    to have a greater scattering cross section than an uncoated
    conducting sphere of the same overall diameter this was
    confirmed experimentally using technique described by results
    of calculations and measurements are shown graphically a
    physical interpretation is presented
