a comparison of two weighting schemes for boolean
    retrieval. describes 2 approaches, tied together by their
    conceptual basis in fuzzy set theory, for representing weighted
    boolean requests. one represents directly the importance of
    component boolean expressions to the user. the other
    establishes conditions that must be met before a document can
    be retrieved. both may have a place in information retrieval
    systems-their relative strengths should appear through
    empirical investigation.
