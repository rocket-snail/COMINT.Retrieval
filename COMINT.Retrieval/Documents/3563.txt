cozi communication zone indicator a general description
    with block diagram of timing and indicating circuits is given
    of a low power oblique incidence ionosphere sounder designed to
    indicate skip distances and communication zones from to
    operation is on any one of six pre set frequencies in the range
    peak pulse power pulse duration and repetition frequency sec
    the one hop skip distance is obtained directly from the time
    lag of the back scatter from the ground after single reflection
    from the ionosphere typical oscillograms show the increase of
    skip distance as the carrier frequency is increased in steps
    from the complete series of records two at each frequency being
    obtained in min
