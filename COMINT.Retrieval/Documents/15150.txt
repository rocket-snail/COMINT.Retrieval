equipment for accurate measurement of height of
    ionosphere layers use of timebase corresponding to a height
    range enables measurements to be made accurate to within the
    timebase triggering is controlled by means of a phase shifter
    calibrated in height so that any desired height range can be
    selected for close examination because of the pulse widening
    involved a differentiator stage with wideband amplifier is
    interposed between receiver output and indicator measurement
    procedure is described
