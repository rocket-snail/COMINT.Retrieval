a long farewell to 'narrow' catchwords. the use of
    'narrow' catchwords as a principle element in catchword
    catalogues is no longer acceptable. the term 'narrow' is too
    vague and does not convey the content and meaning which it
    should. the principle of the 'narrow' catchword has always been
    regarded as defining a classification method; this is however,
    not the case. libraries would be advised to conform with
    standard terminology used in documentation and information
    science and to avoid further use of the 'narrow' catchword or
    'narrow' term. the control of classification terminology is a
    very important area of library science which should be more
    clearly defined. examining such terms as the principle of the
    'narrow' catchword is, therefore, 1 step towards eliminating
    terminology which has no real meaning or use.
