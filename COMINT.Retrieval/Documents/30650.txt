calculation of iron cored inductances for direct current
    a method described by kammerloher is usitors are reviewed and
    design principles are prorresponding to the optimum gap length
    for lamin tions of given shape and size variation of the
    maximum with number of ampere turns is investigated examples
    are worked out
