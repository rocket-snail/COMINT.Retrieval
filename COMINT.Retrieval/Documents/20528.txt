a unitary design system for band pass filters of the
    zobel and laurent types a systematic representation of the
    properties of band pass filters based on the wave parameter
    theory is followed by the development of general design
    formulae for band pass half sections including the zigxag
    filters of laurent the system is based on cauers classification
    of q functions supplemented by some intermediate
    functions
