density function calculations of noise propagation on an
    accelerated multivelocity electron beam the propagation of
    noise fluctuations through the low voltage multivelocity region
    immediately in front of the potential minimum of a diode or
    electron beam has been computed despite the absence of any
    conventional loss elements two noise parameters or measures of
    the noise fluctuations when the beam is passed through a
    multivelocity region are significantly different at the output
    from those at the input changes are such as to lower
    significantly the minimum noise figure of a microwave
