derivation of equivalence theorem of a weakly coupled
    electromagnetic cavity resonator system a general proof of the
    equivalence between a system of weakly coupled cavities and a
    system of coupled resonant lcr circuits is derived from
    maxwells equations by means of a first order perturbation
    calculation the frequency dependence of the system is deduced
    from the equation of state the case of two coupled cavity
    resonators is considered in an example
