on the growth of longitudinal waves propagating in plasma
    an analytical treatment based on a single solution of the one
    dimensional linear kinetic equation describing the propagation
    of highfrequency signals produced by a given external force it
    is shown that for a low temperature of the electron gas it is
    possible to use the ordinary single velocity approximation the
    analysis of the results permits a determination of the
    direction of propagation of natural waves in a plasma and a
    solution of the problem of the existence of increasing waves in
    a rectilinear electron beam
