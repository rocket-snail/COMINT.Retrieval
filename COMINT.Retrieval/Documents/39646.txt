electric currents in the ionosphere part the conductivity
    the effective height integrated conductivity of the ionosphere
    calculated on the dynamo theory and taking account of
    inhibition of the hall current due to polarization of the
    medium is greater than the pedersen conductivity by a factor of
    at least and near the magnetic equator is further increased by
    a factor of to this calculation is shown to overestimate the
    reduction in total current flow in the ionosphere due to the
    shunting effect of the f region when the motion of the f region
    is considered the dynamo theory as presented here gives results
    in agreement with observations and accounts in particular for
    the anomalously large magnetic variations observed near the
    equator
