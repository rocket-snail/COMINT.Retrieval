teletext and viewdata' a new challenge for the designer.
    teletext and viewdata displays present a strong challenge to
    the information designer. the monospaced dot matrix characters
    are relatively crude in their design, and their positioning is
    determined by a fixed grid. the graphics facility is also
    somewhat crude. the scope for typographic and spatial coding of
    information is therefore very limited. there is, however, the
    possibility of using colour as a way of coding information. 7
    colours, including white, are available, but they are not of
    equal brightness and this has important implications for
    legibility. bearing in mind the constraints and freedom offered
    by this kind of display, ways of presenting text, tables,
    indexes and graphics of various kinds are discussed.
