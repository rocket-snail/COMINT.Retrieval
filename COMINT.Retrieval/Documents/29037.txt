measurement of reference service' reference statistics
    1978/79' university library, university of illinois at
    urbana-champaign. the types of statistics needed for the
    administration of a reference programme in an academic library
    were investigated by collecting data on variables such as peak
    times of heavist reference use, type of reference questions,
    time spent in answering questions, type of employee answering
    questions, adequacy of responses, reasons for inadequate
    answers, and whether professional staff were answering the more
    sophisticated questions. analysis of the data indicated that
    such information could be used for the administration of an
    academic library reference service and that a standardised data
    form could be used for both general reference service and
    reference service in a specialised subject area.
