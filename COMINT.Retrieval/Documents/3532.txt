voltage reference node description of a general method of
    analysing linear networks by nodal analysis without specifying
    the node to which all voltages are referred the network can be
    represented by an indefinite admittance matrix which can be
    brought to a definite form by omitting the row and column
    corresponding to a specified reference node the method is
    useful for dealing with valve circuits with earthed grid or
    earthed anode stages or with no earthed electrodes
