solar thermoelectric generators physical characteristics
    relevant to their usefulness for thermocouple materials have
    been determined for various metal alloys and compounds the
    efficiencies of flat plate type solar energy collectors in
    combination with such thermocouples is evaluated the value of
    obtained using type alloys in combination with a bi alloy was
    ten times as great as that obtained with commercially available
    chromel p in combination with constantan using concentrating
    lenses the efficiency obtained with the best alloy combination
    was the maximum economically permissible cost of thermo
    electric generators is evaluated
