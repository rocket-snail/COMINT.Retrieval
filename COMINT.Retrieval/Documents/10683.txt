fifty years of mobile libraries in manchester, 1931-1981.
    the population of manchester expanded rapidly in the years
    following world war i and there was a demand for more branch
    libraries. the necessary money was not available, so the city
    librarian suggested a travelling library on the lines of those
    already in use in the usa and the uk's 1st mobile library took
    to the streets of manchester in july 1931. the service was
    well-used and expanded, was suspended during world war ii, and
    was resumed in 1948. it is now an integral part of the city's
    library service, serving areas unable to support a branch
    library, those unable to visit a branch library, and areas
    where cuts in expenditure have forced branch library
    closures.
