factors affecting document delivery systems' present and
    future. the paper examines the current state of document
    delivery and analyses the factors involved in some existing
    north american and european services. it suggests that factors
    studied so far are not those which are really important, and
    further suggests that there is a great deal of confusion and
    misconceptions surrounding debate on document delivery. some
    factors are proposed for examination which are more fundamental
    to the design of document delivery systems.
