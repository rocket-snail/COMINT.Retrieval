theft and destruction of library materials' the legal
    opportunities for dealing with theft from the collections and
    destruction of library materials. each year a considerable
    amount of material is written off by public libraries as a
    result of theft or damage by library users. in the maastricht
    public library in the netherlands a study of the problem made
    from jan-june 81 showed that some material was removed from the
    library without registering the transaction, some was borrowed
    on tickets containing false or incorrect information, while
    others were borrowed and not returned, or returned in a damaged
    condition. where proof of theft or destruction of library
    property exists the dutch civil code allows library authorities
    to instruct the local chief inspector of justice to take legal
    proceedings against the guilty party. where the defendant is
    found guilty the judge may order compensation to be made to the
    library concerned.
