study of noise reduction by feedback in ultra high
    frequency amplifiers a detailed investigation has been made to
    determine theoretical and practical limits for the cancellation
    of valve noise in rf amplifiers measurements were made on a
    modified planar type of disk seal triode designed to have a
    transit phase angle of about one radian at mcs the conditions
    for complete noise cancellation are determined and expressions
    are derived for input and output admittance available power
    gain and noise figure can be reduced considerably by means of
    feedback but w is thereby reduced at an equivalent or greater
    rate so that the practical application of this method is
    uneconomical with present valves the uncorrelated part of the
    induced grid noise is the most important factor in the increase
    in f at vhf
