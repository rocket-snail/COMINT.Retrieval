interaction of an electron beam with plasma an
    experimental investigation of modulated and unmodulated beams
    of high energy electrons with a high frequency discharge plasma
    is reported when an unmodulated beam moves through the plasma
    oscillations are produced in the beam at frequencies close to
    the plasma frequency
