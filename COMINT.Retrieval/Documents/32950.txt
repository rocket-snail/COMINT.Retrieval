study of the induced electric discharge in rare gases
    experiments were performed using a tube of a few centimetres
    diameter and a frequency of aspects investigated included the
    conditions for starting the discharge and the radiation from
    the discharge theory is developed giving a quantitative
    explanation of the experimental results
