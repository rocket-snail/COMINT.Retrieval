amplification and bandwidth of video amplifiers the
    characteristics of the ideal amplifier with constant
    amplification and constant phase transit throughout the pass
    band are briefly reviewed and the principal types of amplifier
    are analysed with particular reference to amplification and
    bandwidth the theoretical maximum values of these parameters
    are determined for the various types and compared with the
    values obtained in practice and with one another arrangements
    using distributed amplification ad having very wide pass bands
    are considered briefly
