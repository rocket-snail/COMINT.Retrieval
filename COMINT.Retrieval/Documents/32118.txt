the sawtooth derivator the sawtooth derivator differs
    fundamentally from the conventional type of timebase generator
    in that the require waveform is derived from an arbitrary
    waveform which in its turn is derived from the signal applied
    to the cro in this way perfect synchronization is obtained
    various types of clipping and differentiating circuits are
    discussed and a description is given with full circuit details
    of practical equipment which functions entirely automatically
    and covers the frequency range without any switching
    operations
