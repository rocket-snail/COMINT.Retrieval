application of the wiedemann effect to the
    magnetostrictive coupling of crossed coils an electromechanical
    quadripole is described comprising a tubular magnetostrictive
    ferrite core carrying crossed coils one wound toroidally and
    the other as an external helix theory is presented in terms of
    an equivalent circuit the device can be used for filtering
    gating phase reversing etc successful experiments with
    ferroxcube cores operating at frequencies between are
    reported
