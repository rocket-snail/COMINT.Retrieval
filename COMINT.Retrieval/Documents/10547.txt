the decomposition of thin films on bombardment with slow
    electrons the threshold energies of the bombarding electrons
    were determined for the onset of electron absorption
    decomposition and secondary emission the films investigated
    included and the alkali halides the experiments were carried
    out using diode or triode valve systems with an oxide coated
    cathode operated at as the source of the bombarding
    electrons
