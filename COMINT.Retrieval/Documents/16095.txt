a distributed dbms based on anunet-a communications and
    resource sharing network. briefly describes anunet (the
    australian national university's communications network); work
    on distributed data bases; technical aspects; and problems
    relating to the distributed data base management system under
    development. the planned system is based on a single host,
    univac 1100/42, running the university's own version of dms
    1100 (an implementation of the codasyl dbtg model), with
    heterogeneous remote nodes (pdp 11s, decsystem 10s, data
    general novas and hewlett packard 21mx and 2100 machines),
    supporting anunet communications protocols and data base
    message level protocols.
