toward usable user studies. a management-oriented model
    for describing and studying information behaviour is proposed.
    several hypotheses derived from the model are tested using a
    data base describing the information-related attitudes and
    behaviours of some 560 scientists and engineers working in a
    variety of settings and roles. all but one of the hypotheses
    were confirmed, adding support to the model.
