serials control. paper presented at the aslib conference
    information '81' forecasts and realities, oxford university,
    uk, 22-25 sept 81. serials control is throught to be the most
    difficult of library housekeeping processes to automate. no
    automated serials control system has yet been demonstrated to
    be cost-effective. minicomputer based systems show promise of
    more efficient operation. studies at oxford university have
    shown the feasibility of automated serials check-in being
    achieved faster than is possible manually. further studies have
    demonstrated the constraints imposed for a comprehensive system
    to be cost-effective. prediction of the arrival date for
    irregular serials is a major problem. the difficulties (and
    expense) of updating files in real-time represents another
    problem for which a tentative solution is proposed. the need to
    improve the user interface is emphasised and this is one of the
    most important matters for further study.
