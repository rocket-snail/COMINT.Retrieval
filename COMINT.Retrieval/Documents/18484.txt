the nederlands bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch
    library and literature centre) members' meeting, 11th december
    1980' a personal impression. report of the meeting of nblc
    members in amsterdam, 11 dec 80. topics discussed included
    cutbacks in financial support from the government for public
    library services in the netherlands, raising of library
    membership charges, and reduction of the age-limit for free
    library membership. although many of those present were opposed
    to a reduction in library services some felt that the growth of
    recent years, if allowed to continue, could lead to a reduction
    in the quality of services. the question of allowing the public
    a greater voice in the running of public libraries and the
    position of unpaid voluntary staff were also discussed.
