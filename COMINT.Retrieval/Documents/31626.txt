classification of quartz crystal oscillator circuits
    classification is based on quadripole representation ad two
    main classes are distinguished according as the circuit is
    represented by one or two quadripoles in the feedback line the
    first class includes type networks subdivided into series
    resonance and parallel resonance circuits and bridge type
    circuits variations of the a basic circuits are illustrated and
    formulae are derived for the properties and operating
    conditions the main characteristics considered are
    stabilization factors see of excitation conditions operating
    frequency and crystal loading
