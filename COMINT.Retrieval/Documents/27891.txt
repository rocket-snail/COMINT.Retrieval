the needs of the special librarian and the library
    association. library associations are especially important for
    special librarians because they usually work alone or with very
    few colleagues and need associations to stay in touch with
    other librarians and with changes in librarianship. the needs
    for contact with colleagues, for up-to-date knowledge, and
    skills, for cooperation through interlibrary loans and
    networks, and through provision of bibliographic tools, for
    influencing legislation, for formulating and promoting
    standards, and for personal status and achievement are
    discussed.
