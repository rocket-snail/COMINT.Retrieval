plasma containment by r f and d c field combinations the
    advantages are discussed of supplementing d c with r f fields
    which are sometimes more effective and possibly more stable the
    design of r f plugs for sealing the ends of a plasma column
    contained by a d c magnetic field is given in some
    detail
