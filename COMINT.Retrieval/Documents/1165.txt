background noise in ionization chamber pulse amplifiers
    two methods of particle energy measurement are considered for
    the charge collection method milatz and keller of have
    calculated the absolute limit to measurement accuracy for the
    amplifier circuit used for the pulse slope method initiated by
    sherr and peterson a slightly different limit is found circuits
    giving optimum signal noise rato are proposed in each
    case
