library education in canada. outlines the development of
    professional education for librarianship in canada from the
    late 1920s. canada has tended to follow the us pattern and all
    canadian library schools still submit their programmes to the
    american library association for accreditation. however anyone
    can call himself a 'professional librarian' and libraries do
    not have to hire graduates from accredited schools. most
    programmes run for 2 years for a master's degree, the 1st year
    full time and the 2nd part time. schools have recently oriented
    their programmes away from training in routine techniques and
    towards education for planning, administration, the setting of
    standards, organising political activity for library support,
    deployment of human and material resources, fund-raising and
    new methods of bibliographic and subject analysis.
