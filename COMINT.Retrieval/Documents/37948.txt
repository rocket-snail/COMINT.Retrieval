determination of electron density and collision frequency
    in a gaseous discharge by microwave propagation measurements
    the gaseous discharge to be measured fills a section of
    waveguide several wavelengths long and measurements are made of
    the absorption and phase shift of a low power microwave signal
    passing through the discharge results are quoted for ar at
    pressures respectively of and mm hg
