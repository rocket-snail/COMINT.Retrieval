some observations of geomagnetic micropulsations these
    new observations of diurnal variation direction and frequency
    spectrum are viewed in comparison with published data and it is
    suggested that they have a solar time dependence and may occur
    locally at two stations in longitude apart related signals are
    only occasionally observed however the phase relationship l of
    the few which are related together with differences in
    direction characteristics reported by other observatories are
    not in agreement with recent theories of the origin of
    micropulsations
