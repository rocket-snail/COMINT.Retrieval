library services for foreign residents. foreign workers
    have made a positive contribution towards west german
    prosperity but our society is ill prepared for the acuteness of
    the problems facing foreign children and young people. their
    educational deprivation is grounded above all in their inferior
    social position. foreign children should experience a
    socialisation process which will enable them to be integrated
    into german society and re-integrated into the society of their
    native land, for which they must grow up to be both bilingual
    and bicultural. the library should be the foreign citizens'
    centre for information, communication and culture. bilateral
    literature provision, communication and culture. bilateral
    literature provision helps foreign citizens to become
    codetermining, active and creative within our pluralistic
    culture. good library services complementing good schooling are
    an investment for the future.
