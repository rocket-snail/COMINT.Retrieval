asymmetry in the decimetre wave radiation from the sun
    data obtained in australia at the eclipse of november and in
    khartoum at the eclipse of february are adduced in support of
    the conclusion that radiation from the quiet sun at wavelengths
    around cm is best accounted for by a model sun at wavelengths
    around is best accounted for by model sun having an equatorial
