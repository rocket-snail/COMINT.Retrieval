an interdepartmental allocation formula for the
    maximization of use of library materials. develops a
    mathematical formalisation of the problems of maximising use of
    library materials in terms of the ideas developed by t.j.
    pierce and w.e. mcgrath (78/2422) in their work of allocation,
    and solves this problem to produce the allocation formula that
    maximises the use of materials. briefly discusses the
    feasibility of applying the formula.
