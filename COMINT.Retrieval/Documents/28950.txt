subaudio oscillator tunes to cycles a beat frequency
    oscillator using carrier frequencies of about provides an
    output of up to constant within over the frequency range with
    per hour drift and distortion the need for low frequency
    amplification is avoided by the use of a high level mixer
    circuit consisting of two se rectifiers with balancing
    adjustment to eliminate the d c component
