production of the e layer in the oxygen dissociation
    region in the upper atmosphere the probable value of the
    absorption cross section of for the ionization causing the e
    layer is calculated using the o height distribution data
    obtained by moses and wu of discussion indicates that the
    preionization by solar radiation in the range suggested by
    nicolet of and ionization by high energy photons emitted from
    the solar corona hoyle and bates of are both operative in
    producing e layer ionization the former produces the normal e
    layer and the latter is responsible for the fine structure of
    the e layer recently reported by naismith and bramley of
