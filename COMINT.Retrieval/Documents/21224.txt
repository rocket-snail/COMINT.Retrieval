chapman behaviour in the lower ionosphere it is shown
    that chapmans relations for the variation of critical frequency
    and height of a layer with solar zenith angle can be applied to
    any point on that layer and that it is not necessary to assume
    monochromatic radiation these results are then applied to
    electron density height profiles and it is shown that chapman
    behaviour can be detected to a height of being consistent with
    a scale height of or km
