public lending right' a new law in the united kingdom.
    reviews briefly the main arguments put forward by the uk
    library association against the 1979 public lending right act,
    which established the right of authors to some financial reward
    based on the frequency with which their books are borrowed from
    public libraries. summarises the main provisions of the act,
    which requires the compilation of a register of books and
    authors entitled to payment. discusses the consultative
    document on this scheme which was published in 1980, and
    indicates some of the problems which are likely to arise when
    it comes into operation. notes that the act apparently does not
    apply to music-which is presumably deemed to be covered by
    performing rights.
