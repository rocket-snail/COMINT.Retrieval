cost recovery' the case against. argues against the
    concept of cost recovery for interloans on the grounds that
    this would impede the free flow of information in the

    libraries should be eased in other ways such as special
    subsidy, a wider spread of demand over a greater number of
    libraries as bibliographic networks develop, improved training
    of interloan officers and possibly by the establishment of an
    australian national lending library of 1st resort.
