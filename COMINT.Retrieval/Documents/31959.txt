a criterion of stability for oscillations in n mesh
    networks with varying parameters analysis given previously of
    is generalized to apply to any network in which some or all of
    the capacitances or inductances vary periodically conditions
    necessary for the growth of free oscillations having small
    initial amplitudes are investigated the system is represented
    by a determinant equation from whose roots the stability
    conditions are derived
