interpretations of radio reflections from the aurora
    report and discussion o of measurement made at ithaca ny pulse
    radar experiments at show that reflections occur only during
    aurorae having ray structure the transmitted beam must be
    directed roughly normal to the rays echoes are complex cw
    signals at various frequencies between and showed a rate of
    fading roughly proportional to frequency ie much higher than
    the fading rate for normal ionospheric conditions observations
    are interpreted as indicating that echoes are due to scattering
    from numerous auroral columns of ionization fading is due to
    wind like motion of these columns other interpretations are
    critically discussed reasons are given for the possible
    occurrence of auroral reflection at f region as well as e
    region levels
