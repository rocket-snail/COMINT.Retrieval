simultaneous approximation for the amplitude and delays
    time of an ideal low pass filter using the flow analogy
    analogies between transmission phenomena in networks and
    current flow in a potential fields are discussed a distortion
    free low pass filter can be represented by two superposed
    fields one with parallel flows corresponding to the distortion
    free aspect and the other with radial flow corresponding to the
    filter aspect such a representation involves a finite residual
    error which cannot be eliminated without introducing
    instability but which can be reduced indefinitely by increasing
    the delay time
