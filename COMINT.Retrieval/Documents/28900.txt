a versatile transistor circuit the design is described of
    point contact transistor switching circuits such that direct
    currents of the order of several tens of milliamperes can be
    handled with a voltage drop of only one or two volts
    applications of these circuits in a symmetrical push pull
    magnetic writing circuit and a shift register are
    considered
