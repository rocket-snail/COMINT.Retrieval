librarianship in the underdeveloped countries. paper
    presented at a conference on reading materials for library
    education, west berlin, 15-20 dec 80. in the underdeveloped
    countries the average citizen is poor and illiterate and 90% of
    the population lives in rural areas, where transport and
    communication services are extremely limited. in most
    underdeveloped countries the financial budget allocated to
    library staff and bookstock is extremely limited. in addition,
    in some countries considerable sums have been spent on the
    construction of city libraries to u.k. and u.s.a. standards
    with a consequent reduction in funds for rural areas. the
    available resources should be divided more evenly to provide
    improved services throughout the entire country.
