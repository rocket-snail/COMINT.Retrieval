relation between the intensity distributions over
    radiating systems and their directivity characteristics fourier
    transform analysis is used to show that contrary to fischers
    result the directivity characteristic of a linear or plane
    radiator of finite dimensions is uniquely related to the
    amplitude distribution over the radiator the theory is extended
    to the consideration of propagation media with local
    inhomogeneities acting as secondary radiators and an
    investigation is made of the relation between distribution of
    inhomogeneities and the directivity characteristic of the
    scattered radiation
