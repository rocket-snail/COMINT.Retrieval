disinfection and straightening of parchment damaged by
    microorganisms. bacteria and micellar fungi were isolated from
    damaged parts of ancient manuscripts on parchment and
    investigated. catamin ab (already used as a disinfectant for
    paintings) was found to be a highly effective antiseptic agent
    against these parchment-destroying microorganisms and a
    disinfecting technique incorporating the straightening of
    deformed parchments was developed. it was also found that
    catamin ab has no destructive effect on the physico-mechanical
    and physico-chemical properties of parchment.
