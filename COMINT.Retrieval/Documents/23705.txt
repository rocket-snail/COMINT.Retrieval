theory of the ferromagnetic microwave amplifier all three
    possible types of operation using respectively two
    electromagnetic cavity modes two sample modes and one sample
    and one cavity mode are discussed one especially simple case
    that of a sphere in the first type of operation is treated
    separately thereafter all three cases are discussed in terms of
    scalar and vector potentials an appendix deals with the gain
    bandwidth problem and gives an expression for the equivalent
    negative q of the sample
