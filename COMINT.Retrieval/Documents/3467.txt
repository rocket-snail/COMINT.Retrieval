the effects of terminations and dissipation on the
    insertion loss of some simple ladder filters by using special
    terminations the selectivity of these filters can be improved
    and elements with relatively low values of q can be used
    insertion loss curves indicating the combined effects of the
    terminations and of dissipation in the filter elements are
    presented in a form applicable to low pass high pass and band
    pass filters of several types
