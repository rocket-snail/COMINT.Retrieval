research, literature, and a rich marriage. library
    historical portraits (2). a portrait of peter frederik suhm,
    1728-98, author of a history of denmark. he opened his private
    library in his house in central copenhagen to the public and
    people from all spheres of life used it. little is known of
    this library as catalogues, correspondence, invoices and
    records of borrowings were lost. although 1 of suhm's
    librarians, r. nyerup, was a prolific author, he never wrote
    about the library. with 100,000 volumes, it was larger than the
    university library. suhm spent 5 times as much on his library
    as the government spent on the royal library, not yet open to
    the public, and paid for it with his wealthy wife's money. 2
    years before his death the library was sold to the royal
    library.
