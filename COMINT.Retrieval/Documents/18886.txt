electronic integrator with immediate digital output
    details are given of a technique for obtaining an instantaneous
    numerical value proportional to the area of a recurring voltage
    transient the basic principle is to summate the pulses from a
    generator whose repetition rate is a linear function of the
    instantaneous input voltage the system has a high order of
    linearity approximately and is used for roughly triangular
    pulses of duration
