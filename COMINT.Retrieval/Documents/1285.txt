oscillations and fluctuations in gas discharges a
    tentative classification is made of different forms of
    disturbance encountered in gaseous conductors constituted by
    low pressure tubes a distinction is drawn between cases where
    the gaseous conductor acts as a circuit unit possessing
    resistance capacitance and inductance any of which may be
    positive or negative and cases where internal disturbances
    occur in the gaseous con ductor which are practically
    independent of the external circuit the origin and nature of
    electron an ion oscillations is discussed
