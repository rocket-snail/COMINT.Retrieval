diffraction by a thick semi infinite plate a method of
    analysis based on that previously described of february is
    applied to the problem of the diffraction of a two dimensional
    plane harmonic wave by a semi infinite perfectly conducting
    plate of thickness d expressions are obtained for the distant
    field when d has any value and the effects at the boundary of
    the shadow are deduced extension of the theory to the problem
    of diffraction by a thick plate of finite length is briefly
    discussed the theory is also extended to incident scalar waves
    whose direction of propagation does not lie in the plane
    perpendicular to the plate
