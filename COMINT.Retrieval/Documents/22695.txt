instability of a plasma with an anisotropic distribution
    of ion and electron velocities investigation of the propagation
    of magnetohydrodynamic waves in an infinite a rarefied plasma a
    kinetic treatment leads to an increase of the instability
    region compared to that obtained in the quasihydrodynamic
    approximation
