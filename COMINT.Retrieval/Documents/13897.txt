the development of a subject index for the dutch national
    bibliography. in may 80 the joint working parties on the dutch
    national bibliography and the dutch national bibliographical
    centre published their final report containing proposals for a
    national bibliography in the netherlands based on brinkmann's
    catalogue of books. in view of the limited number of terms used
    in the subject index of brinkmann's catalogue it was proposed
    to adopt the thesaurus of headings developed by the netherlands
    bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and
    literature) with the addition of udc and siso classification
    numbers to each entry. a test-run has identified a core of some
    3,500 headings which will be input into the data base to
    provide a subject index to the bibliography. the system will
    become operational on 1 jan 81.
