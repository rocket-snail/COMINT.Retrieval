a test of the differences in the literature history of
    four historical accounts of the quantum mechanics problem.
    examines 4 historical accounts of the quantum mechanics problem
    in physics. the purpose is to describe the literature used by
    the histories quantitatively using frequency of data of
    publication. additionally, 1 of the histories was tested
    against the other 3 to determine differences. a moments test
    and a t test were employed. the results indicated the
    literature of quantum mechanics, when plotted as a function of
    frequency of publication date is non-normal, negatively skewed,
    and is platykurtic. the test for difference between the one
    history and the cumulative histories was non-significant.
    interpretations of the results are discussed.
