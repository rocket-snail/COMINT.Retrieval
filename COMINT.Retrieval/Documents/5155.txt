motion of a single cloud in the ionosphere the system
    comprising cloud and ionosphere is treated as analogous to the
    system formed by a horizontal wire aerial and the ground the
    radiation pattern consists of minor lobes arranged
    symmetrically with respect to a central major lobe as this
    pattern moves with the cloud periodic fading of transmitted
    pulses is observed at the receiver periodic fading preceded and
    followed by a steady signal can thus with appropriate
    reservations be interpreted as due to a single cloud an example
    is discussed in which maxima were observed the wavelength being
    the horizontal length of the cloud is estimated to be
    about
