bibliographic retrieval versus availability of documents'
    the problem of selection. librarians are constantly faced with
    the task of supplying literature on rapidly developing
    subjects, especially in technology and medicine. mechanical
    information retrieval is apt to yield vast amounts of
    references which have to be weeded out. criteria for this vary,
    but are usually dictated by necessity, namely the actual
    availability of documents. thus the user can readily be
    supplied with the relevant literature in well known journals
    stocked by the library. it is questionable whether the user
    gets a good coverage initially, or whether he must insist on
    total retrieval of documents. the problem of selection will
    probably become more acute in the future. a possible solution
    is to analyse the growth and spread of papers relevant to a
    specific topic in broader based journals.
