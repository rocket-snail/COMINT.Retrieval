coherent generation of microwave power by annihilation
    radiation of a prebunched beam millimetre wave radiation at the
    level has been produced by the creation and annihilation of a
    tightly bunched electron beam a proposed extension of the
    method based on optical techniques is intended to produce power
    in the submillimetre region
