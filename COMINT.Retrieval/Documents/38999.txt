a statistical theory of ionospheric drifts a statistical
    study of the fluctuations in plasma density is used in an
    attempt to interpret drift velocities it is assumed that the
    ionization is transported by a turbulent flow in the neutral
    air under the action of the magnetic field and the dynamo
    electric field the application of the theory to different
    heights in the ionosphere is examined
