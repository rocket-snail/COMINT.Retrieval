very long sequences of geomagnetic activity and its
    annual variation a study was made of the recurrence tendency of
    geomagnetic activity for the period to two long sequences of
    storms were identified mainly associated with solar m regions
    the mean recurrence period for each of the sequences was days
    characteristic annual variation is attributed to the approach
    of the earths projection on the solar disk towards the zones of
    maximum solar activity
