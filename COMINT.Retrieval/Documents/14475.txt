calculation of the magnetic field in the ferromagnetic
    layer of a magnetic drum the variation of the field with
    permeability air gap layer thickness and other factors is
    investigated assuming the ferromagnetic layer to be of low
    permeability spinel material while the problem is nonlinear the
    linear approximation is satisfactory in some cases numerical
    computations are presented for the drum used in the swedish
    computer besk
