the effect of the introduction of computers on library
    and research staff. describes the conversion of the library of
    congress congressional research service's current awareness
    service from a manual to an automated mode, emphasising the
    effects of automation upon staff and clientele. although
    initially the conversion was attended by various staff and
    equipment problems, full system implementation was highly
    successful. automation produced no saving in either time or
    staff; rather the contrary. however the true benefits of
    automation appear as a multiplicity of previously unobtainable
    services and products of far-ranging utility to system
    users.
