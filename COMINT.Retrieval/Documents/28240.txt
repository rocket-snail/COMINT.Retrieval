electrodynamics of charge carriers of negative effective
    mass in crystals the transport properties of negative effective
    mass carriers in crystals are studied the electrical
    conductivity of a sample in which the electron distribution
    function is weakly perturbed from its thermal equilibrium value
    is always positive even in the presence of a magnetic field
    cyclotron resonance experiments in equilibrium should therefore
    display energy absorption
