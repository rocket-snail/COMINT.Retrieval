anomalous variation of total absorption of radio waves
    reflected from the f region of the ionosphere around midday
    observations made at banaras using frequencies higher than f
    layer critical frequency show two maxima one before and the
    other after local noon the first maximum has been attributed to
    thermal expansion of the f region the effect of which is
    normally observed before midday the second coincides with the
    usual maximum of total absorption observed at lower frequencies
    after midday
