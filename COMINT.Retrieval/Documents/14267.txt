ionospheric irregularities causing random fading of very
    low frequencies ionospheric studies by the lunar technique
    equipment operating near ottawa comprises a transmitter keyed
    on for sec and off for sec feeding a paraboloid via a horn and
    orthogonal dipoles with a similar reflector feeding a dual
    conversion receiver and synchronous detection is used to give
    an af output signal equal in frequency to the doppler shift of
    the signal reflected from the moon preliminary results indicate
    the presence of fading due to libration long and short period
    faraday rotation and long term fading without faraday
