basic microwave properties of hot magnetoplasmas the
    usual conductivity tensor of a uniform plasma in a uniform
    static magnetic field is generalized to include four effects of
    random motion of plasma electrons the results are applied to
    the evaluation of the index of refraction for microwave
    signals
