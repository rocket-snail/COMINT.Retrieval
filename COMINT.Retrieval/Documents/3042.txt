the need for libraries. the construction of new library
    buildings as well as the computerisation of library and
    information services have been studied by the staff of a
    special department at the cyril and methodius national library
    in sofia. now, the time has come to establish an independent
    technical centre for libraries, similar to the one in prague,
    czechoslovakia. among the centre's 1st and foremost commitments
    should be the collection of information on the contemporary
    worldwide trends in the development of library buildings and
    their up-to-date equipment. this broad general knowledge should
    be pooled for the new, specified library buildings, and also
    for the reconstruction, extension and modernisation of existing
    libraries. such activities should lead to the establishment of
    archives of technical documentation and industrial catalogues
    for the benefit of architects, designers, librarians and
    others. other long-term targets include the design of a new,
    progressive method of service to readers and information users
    and to enhance the quality of both work and private
    lives.
