a unidirectional attenuator with delay line and ferrite
    element for the frequency band the attenuation afforded by
    various devices comprising ferrite tubes surrounding helical
    lines and in turn surrounded by tubular magnets was
    investigated experimentally results are presented graphically
    the attenuation obtained with the final design was about in the
    forward direction and in the blocking direction
