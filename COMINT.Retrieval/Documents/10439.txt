problems in issuing brazilian current bibliography.
    discusses the present situation in the context of the essential
    requirements for establishing a national bibliography-editorial
    agreement and compulsory legal deposit. taking as criteria for
    evaluation, exhaustivity, regularity and accuracy, examines 12
    current and recent publications attempting to provide
    bibliographic coverage, including the brazilian national
    library's bibliographic bulletin, and a number of productions
    from commercial publishers and institutions. concludes that
    until legal deposit is enforced and the national library
    bulletin issued on a regular basis, the national bibliography
    will remain inadequate.
