non-use and loser studies in collection development.
    paper presented at the annual conference of the american
    library association, july 80. argues that use and user studies
    have not been widely adopted, or been influential in library
    administration primarily because we do not yet have a good
    understanding of the context in which they should be
    interpreted. suggests that an understanding of the relevant
    aspects of the sociology of the community is essential to the
    design of library services, policies and goals, and to the
    meaningful interpretation of studies of collection use and user
    patterns. describes briefly an intelligence system for library
    administration designed to provide this.
