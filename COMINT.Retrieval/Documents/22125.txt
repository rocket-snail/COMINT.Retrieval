rigorous, systematic approach to automatic data editing
    and its statistical basis. automatic data editing is the
    computerised identification and correction of data errors.
    these techniques can provide error statistics that indicate the
    frequency of various types of data errors, diagnostic
    information that aids in identifying inadequacies in the data
    collection system, and a clean data base appropriate for use in
    further decision making, in modelling, and for inferential
    purposes.
