on the dynamo theory of geomagnetic field variations
    chapmans expression for the current function is solved in the
    most general way assuming that the main component in
    atmospheric oscillation is semidiurnal and using th same
    conductivity function as chapman tables of coefficients of the
    current function and numerical equinoctial values of th
    coefficients deduced by the authors and by chapman are given
    the sq variations of h and v are deduced and compared with the
    results of observations at abinger and alibag and with chapmans
    analysis in these calculations the phase of the atmospheric
    oscillations has been taken as and results compare well with
    observations
