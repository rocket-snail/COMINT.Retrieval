the diurnal and annual variations of over the polar
    regions the variations have been studied for about stations
    over a three year period and the following results have been
    found the diurnal variation is largest in winter and smallest
    in summer the maximum values of occur at noon in the northern
    and at midnight in the southern hemisphere there is a regular
    annual variation for a given time of day in northern winter has
    deep minima in the morning and evening in summer the latitude
    differences in are small but become large in winter up to per
    degree the lines of equal critical frequency lie between
    circles of geographic and geomagnetic latitude
