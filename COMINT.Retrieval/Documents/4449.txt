temperature and field emission of electrons from metals
    calculations are made of emission current density and energy
    distribution for surface electric field strengths between and
    temperatures up to and various values of work function the
    evaluation is made by numerical integration of the known
    expression for the emission based on the free electron theory
    of metals and the wave mechanical barrier transmission
    coefficient of results are presented graphically and are
    consistent with the field emission equation for low
    temperatures and with the richardson thermionic emission
    formula for low fields the work is relevant to previously
    reported investigations of the vacuum arc
