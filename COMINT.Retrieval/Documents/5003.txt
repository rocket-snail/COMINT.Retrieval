integration of thesauri in the social sciences. paper
    presented at the conta conference, bielefeld, 24-27 may 81.
    discusses the objectives and compilation of the proposed
    integrated thesaurus of the social sciences, which is intended
    to act as a master reference tool, as an aid in searching
    across data bases, or a switching mechanism. the 1st step in
    compilation should be the merging of terms to form a descriptor
    bank. to compare the merged terms at the concept level,
    analysis in sub-fields is proposed within a classification
    framework, preferably 1 with a faceted structure, such as the
    2nd edition of the 2bliss bibliographic classification. 1the
    classification would serve as the master against which the
    terms from the merged information languages, arranged in a
    compatibility matrix, would be compared. the master
    classification would be modified during interaction with the
    matrix terms, and emerge as the integrated thesaurus in a
    format similar to that of the bsi root thesaurus, having a d
    etailed classified display and full alphabetical section.
    provides an example worked out in the sub-field of unemployment
    using terms from 5 thesauri and the udc. also considers
    multilingual implications, testing and updating.
