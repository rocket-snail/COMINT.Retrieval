the dartmouth catalogue system-five years later.
    dartmouth regional library (nova scotia) has been running a
    computerised cataloguing system for 5 years. it contains over
    80,000 records pertaining to printed, audio-visual, and
    micro-format material. cumulative current acquisitions
    catalogues are produced 8 times a year. at the end of each
    year, these are merged with the master files and a new complete
    catalogue is produced. the system costs are 13 cents per title
    added (this includes editing, update, and maintenance, but not
    input charges). the system has proved very successful and
    further developments to improve effectiveness and efficiency
    are planned.
