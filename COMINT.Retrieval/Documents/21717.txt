public lending right' the south african scene.
    contribution to a thematic issue on public lending right (plr).
    in south africa, authors are not remunerated for use of their
    works in libraries and, in comparison with most western
    countries, very little is being done by the state to support
    authors financially and stimulate local book production and
    literature. relatively few publications on plr have appeared
    and the authors' campaign for a plr system has not yet gained
    momentum.
