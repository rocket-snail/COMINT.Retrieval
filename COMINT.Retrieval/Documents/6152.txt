millimicrosecond digital computer logic a system of fast
    pulse logic is described which combines the efficiency of
    transformer coupled stages with digit delay tolerances
    approaching that of dc coupled systems logical circuits for or
    and inverter and reclock are shown together with a driver which
    permits a fan out factor of transistor circuits are used
