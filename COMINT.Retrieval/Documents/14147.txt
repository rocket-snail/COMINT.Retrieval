comments on a 'method for generating a chemical reaction
    index for storage and retrieval of information'. a recently
    proposed method for generating numeric identifiers for chemical
    reactions is discussed. it is shown that the method depends
    upon the exact form in which the reaction is described and also
    the method results in the same identifier being assigned to
    different reaction types.
