influence of an inhomogeneity of the high frequency field
    in nuclear magnetic resonance theoretical results show that to
    a first order approximation the inhomogeneity has no effect on
    the signal amplitude provided that the conditions for a maximal
    signal in a homogeneous field are fulfilled
