rocket measurement of the upper ionosphere by a radio
    propagation technique an example of measurement of the electron
    density profile up to by means of the tso two frequency
    technique is presented including the determination of inferred
    scale height and temperature of the upper ionosphere a
    correction procedure is outlined necessary for the
    determination of local electron density data
