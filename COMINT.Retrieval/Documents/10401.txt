a preliminary meteorological study of the origin of
    whistlers a possible unique source of whistling atmospherics is
    found to be the presence of large cyclonic disturbances at the
    geomagnetic conjugate point for the whistler receiving station
    the possible role of these cyclonic disturbances in producing
    narrow magneto ionic duct propagating conditions is also
    discussed
