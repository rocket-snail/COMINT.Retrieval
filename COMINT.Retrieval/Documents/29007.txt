magnetic control of the frequency of valve transmitters
    by means of an electrodeless gas discharge the tuned circuit
    inductor of an oscillator was wound round an argon filled
    spherical container in which an electrodeless discharge could
    be maintained and a magnetic field was applied parallel to the
    plane of the coil the oscillator frequency was found to vary
    almost linearly over a certain range of field strengths and was
    also dependent on the gas pressure in the discharge
