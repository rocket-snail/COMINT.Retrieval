energy and duration of a sudden ionospheric disturbance a
    study was made of the maximum amount of energy which might be
    absorbed by the atmosphere down to during a sudden ionospheric
    disturbance assuming that the ionization is caused by lyman
    radiation from the sun and that all oxygen present is ionized
    the energy absorbed by the sunlit hemisphere is ergs
