selling to survive. edited and abridged version of a talk
    given at the library association's branch and mobile libraries
    group weekend school, lytham st. annes, oct-nov 80. although
    income-generating innovations will help the public library in
    the short term, the resultant revenue will always be a
    relatively small proportion of the budget and such activities
    could prejudice the library's long term survival by giving the
    public the wrong impression. only a more business-like,
    planned, balanced approach than previously practised can save
    the public library. marketing can offer such an approach. the
    library should tailor services to meet the needs of its
    community, train its staff to be salespeople, and work on
    personal communication with the public.
