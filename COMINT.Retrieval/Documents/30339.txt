libraries and computers. the debate on computers in
    libraries centres around 2 questions' whether computers on the
    whole are of benefit to users, and whether the bums system in
    particular is of value. introduction of computers means that
    library staff become dependent on experts. as processes become
    automated they also become dehumanised, and readers use
    machines directly with minimal help from staff. some skills are
    lost and replaced with routines. as for the bums system, some
    routines have merely replaced others. a traditional card
    catalogue is easier to use than the bums catalogue, although
    the latter makes survey of the library's total stock possible.
    but this leads in turn to increase in the number of requests
    within the library system; it favours the active, experienced
    users, but discourages the inexperienced and the browsers. the
    cost of gathering of statistics through through bums and
    training of staff in data technology must be set against other
    possible uses of the resources.
