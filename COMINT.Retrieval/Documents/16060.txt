the impedance of shorted edge wound capacitors results on
    the frequency variation of the impedance of this type of
    capacitor obtained by leiterer are discussed using simple
    mathematics the analysis is given first neglecting losses and
    is then extended to take account of losses in the dielectric
    and in the thin metal films eddy currents in the projecting
    contact layer and in thicker metal foils are also taken into
    account the method is used to determine the transfer impedance
    of lead through capacitors
