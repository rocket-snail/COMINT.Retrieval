goodbye and thanks for the fight. interview with a
    norwegian chief librarian who has recently moved to cultural
    administration, having held joint posts since 1967. discusses
    the chief librarian/cultural secretary relationship within
    municipal and country administration; the role of the state,
    the ministry of church and education and the national library
    office in the second half of the 70s, a difficult time for
    norwegian librarianship; the main problems facing norwegian
    libraries in the 80s; his involvement with the association of
    municipal library employees; his greatest satisfactions (salary
    improvements, librarians' recognition as a profession, and the
    forward progress of the norwegian library service) and his
    greatest irritation (that librarians are not sufficiently
    politically involved).
