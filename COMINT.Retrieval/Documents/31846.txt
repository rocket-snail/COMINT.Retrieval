investigations on artificial dielectrics at micro wave
    frequencies the transmission of a wave through a parallel plate
    array was studied experimentally the observed variation of
    phase change with angle of incidence is in fair agreement with
    that calculated from the formula given by the difference
    between them is attributed to diffraction effects and the
    presence of higher order modes inside the array values are
    deduced for the minimum dimensions required to avoid
    diffraction effects
