lunar tidal variations in the sporadic e region lunar
    tidal variations in the e layer are deduced from a statistical
    study of records from various stations the maximum amplitude of
    the lunar semidiurnal variation of e for a period of a year
    resembles that of the f layer in summer it is larger than that
    of the f layer especially in middle latitudes the magnitude of
    the height variation is similar to that of the f layer the
    maximum height variation occurs about six hours after the lunar
    culminations and the maximum value of e two or three hours
    later possible explanations of the phenomena are
    discussed
