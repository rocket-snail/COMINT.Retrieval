the anomalous equatorial belt in the f layer an
    examination has been made of the relation between the maximum
    electron density and geomagnetic latitude for y hours of the
    equinox day other than noon the abnormally low values of n
    found over a wide equatorial belt at noon tnd to disappear
    during the afternoon and to be replaced by abnormally high
    values during the evening the n anomaly disappears between
    midnight and these variations appear to be due to contraction
    of the vertical extent of the f layer during the first half of
    the night and an expansion prior to noon
