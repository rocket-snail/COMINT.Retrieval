theoretical and experimental study of back scattering
    cross section of an infinite ribbon the geometrical optics
    approximation is derived for the back scattering cross section
    per unit length of an infinite ribbon a comparison is made with
    the exact theory the approximate theory of sommerfeld the
    variation method and with experimental results obtained through
    the space separation method for the measurement of back
    scattering cross sections in a parallel plate region
