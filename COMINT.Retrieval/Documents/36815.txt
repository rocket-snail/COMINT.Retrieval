    applications part translation the minkowski field equations are
    presented in a form to suit the particular conditions a
    definition is given of apparent dielectric constant
    sommerfields treatment of unipolar induction is extended to
    magnetizable bodies unipolar induction in the case of
    translational motion is identified with es induction in the
