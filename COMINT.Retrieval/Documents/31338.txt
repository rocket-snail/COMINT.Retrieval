coils for the production of high intensity pulsed
    magnetic fields the design performance and applications of a
    pulsed field system for are described it consists of a
    capacitor bank charged to which is discharged through a be cu
    helix of in internal diameter and long detailed design data are
    also given for a range of coils giving increased volume and
    field uniformity at lower field intensities and include a coil
    providing transverse access to the field
