the complete specification of a network by a single
    parameter if the transfer function of a linear passive network
    is defined as the output response divided by the input driving
    force it can be written in iether polar of cartesian form where
    is the amplitude response is the phase characteristic is the in
    phase component and is the quadrature component the transient
    response to a unit step function can be determined within a
    constant from either alone and are all related and any one can
    be used to compute the other two the derivation of these
    relations is valid for networks with either distributed or
    lumped constants including transducers and the question of
    minimum phase does not arise a graphic method is described for
    computing from either and universal curves are included
    equipment is described which sweeps or a polar plot of and
    directly an intensity frequency marker circuit is included
    which produces multiple harmonically related dots on the sweep
    response it is also possible to sweep the departure from phase
    linearity by a heterodyne process the sweep can be used on low
    pass or band pass systems
