the impedance value of carbon film resistors as a
    function of frequency and dc resistance an arrangement is
    described for impedance measurements in which the dimensions of
    the mounting are standardized in relation to resistor
    dimensions so that comparisons are possible between results
    obtained for resistors of different size curves are given of
    maximum usable frequency as a function of dc resistance and of
    skin effect as a function of frequency and surface
    resistance
