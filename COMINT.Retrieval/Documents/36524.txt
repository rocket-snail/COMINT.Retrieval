urgent measures for improving location references of
    periodical articles by way of the periodical data bank. the
    national reference system for periodicals and serials is the
    periodical data bank at the german library institute and the
    state library of prussian cultural heritage in berlin. the data
    bank contains title data on 180,000 german and foreign
    periodical articles with 500,000 location references. to
    improve the supply of periodical articles over the short term
    the following measures are necessary' the acceleration of
    cataloguing of all periodical collections in all types of
    libraries involved in the national literature supply system;
    the data collections of other periodical reference systems
    should be included in the data bank; title data in the
    periodical data bank should be compared with that supplied by
    subject information services with a view to acquiring missing
    titles; the data bank should be concentrated in an on-line
    information bank. an efficient on-line system would event ually
    lead to users being able to order periodicals directly and
    being referred to the nearest relevant library.
