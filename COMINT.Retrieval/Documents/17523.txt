current voltage characteristics of a self supporting gas
    discharge in a transverse magnetic field continuation of
    previous work of march measurements were made using coaxial
    cylinder electrodes with axial magnetic field in argon at
    pressures from to below torr falling or rising characteristics
    are obtained according as the pressure is greater or smaller
    tha some thousandths of a torr at pressures above this value
    the discharge has the nature of a glow discharge with positive
    space charge at pressures below this value this value the
    characteristics are those of a self supporting high vacuum
    discharge with negative space charge
