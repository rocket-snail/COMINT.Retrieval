gain stable mixers and amplifiers with current feedback
    narrow band radio frequency amplifiers and mixers may be
    stabilized by negative feedback without increasing the
    bandwidth excessively a couple using current feedback is
    described this couple requires only a simple resistive beta
    circuit and may be designed such that the band pass
    characteristic is largely independent of the feedback
    experimental results are reported
