the reactance characteristics of concentric line circuits
    with interrupted inner conductor oscillator circuits in which
    the inner conductor is interrupted e g those comprising
    diskseal valves are investigated to determine the reactance as
    a function of gap and line section lengths normally the higher
    resonant frequencies of the circuit are not harmonics of the
    fundamental frequency
