a discussion of the motion in nitrogen of free electrons
    with small energies with reference to the ionosphere it is
    found that the collision cross section of electrons is
    proportional to their velocity from this result an accurate
    expression is derived for the velocity of electron drift in
    terms of the mean energy of the electrons the energy losses are
    found to be mainly due to excitation of the rotational states
    of the nitrogen molecules
