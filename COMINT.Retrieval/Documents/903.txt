fm transient response of band pass circuits a general
    formula is derived for the instantaneous deviation of output
    frequency resulting from a step change of input frequency
    calculations are presented for large frequency shifts in a
    single tuned circuit and for small frequency shifts in
    amplifiers with various numbers of tuned circuits for small
    input steps near the middle of the pass band the transient
    response is the same for fm as for am stagger tuning gives rise
    to overshoot but the extent of this is small if the amount of
    stagger is no more than enough to provide maximally flat
    response in the steady state
