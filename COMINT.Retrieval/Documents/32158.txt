the small academic library and the new cooperation.
    although spiraling costs and reduced budgets require that small
    academic libraries form clusters to share resources and
    services, consortia and library networks so far have taken only
    tentative or shallow steps in this direction. real and
    meaningful steps can and must be taken to develop joint
    acquisition policies, effective and timely interlibrary loan
    procedures, cooperative reference services, and division of
    responsibility for periodicals. resource utilisation in the
    areas of technical processes, staff, and equipment can be
    improved, and librarians need to adopt an attitude of
    interdependency and shared mutual responsibility. clusters of 5
    to 10 libraries within a limited geographic proximity offer a
    feasible framework with an individual in each committed to seek
    out, develop, and maintain cooperative programmes. report not
