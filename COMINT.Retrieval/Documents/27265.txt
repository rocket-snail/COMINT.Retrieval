    80. with growth comes complexity; and librarianship becomes
    increasingly complex as it grows. a 2-fold approach to the
    understanding of librarianship is suggested. firstly,
    librarianship should be viewed as a general discipline and its
    characteristics should be studied as a whole, and secondly,
    basic components of librarianship should be identified, by
    reducing the complexity of the field to its simplest parts-its
    'roots'. proposes a model of 'metalibrarianship' based on this
    analysis, and involving assumptions about its nature in terms
    of the mechanism, expanded contextualism and formism, and
    suggesting that the primary root metaphor of metalibrarianship
    is the relationship between the generic book, its subject
    matter, and its reader.
