data-tagging experiment for energy-related documents at
    chemical abstracts service. an experiment is described that
    evaluated the usefulness and economic feasibility of
    incorporating data tags into secondary information files. tags
    are brief codes that indicate the presence in a primary
    document of specific types of numerical data. tags were
    selected in cooperation with users of the u.s. department of
    energy's (doe) recon system and added to a special version of
    the computer-readable energy file. recon users assisted in an
    evaluation of the tagging process. it was found that data tags
    do increase access to numerical data in the primary literature,
    but a file spanning several years is necessary to produce
    useful results. evaluation of processing costs revealed that
    after the initial training period, costs were not significantly
    greater for the number and types of data tags employed in this
    study. the feasibility of including data tags in nonenergy
    sections of 2chemical abstracts 1was examin ed with primary
    emphasis on economic and editorial factors. it was shown that
    subject content governs the selection of data types to be
    tagged for a section or group of related sections with the
    overriding consideration of user requirements.
