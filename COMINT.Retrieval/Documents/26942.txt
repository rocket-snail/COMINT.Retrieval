on-line lending registration. a pilot project of the
    state of baden-wurttemberg. in 1975 a recommendation was made
    in the baden-wurttemberg library plans to introduce
    computerised lending systems in all university and state
    libraries. a pilot project to test the possibilities of such a
    system was started in freiburg university library in oct 77.
    the automation progressed in 3 phases' the fiction and text
    book collection; the public book collection; the stockroom
    collection. a dietz standard computer system with adaptations
    for a lending system was used. the introduction of the
    automated process in the 1st 2 stages of the plan was very
    successful and led to preparations being made for other
    libraries in tubingen and karlsruhe to adopt the system. the
    3rd phase will be completed by the beginning of 1982. the
    computerised lending system led to an increase in lending from
    350,000 in 1975 to 700,000 in 1980 which reflects a
    considerable improvement in the library user service.
