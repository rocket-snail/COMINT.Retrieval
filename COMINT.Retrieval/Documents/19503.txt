investigation of the potential barrier between two
    electrodes of the same metal with different applied potentials
    a theoretical investigation of the barrier transparency and
    tunnel effect analysis leads to formulae which for limiting
    cases give the known results corresponding to a rectangular or
    triangular type of barrier
