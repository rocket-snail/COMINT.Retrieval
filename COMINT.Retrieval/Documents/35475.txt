the tulane law library in new orleans' a window on the
    world. the law library at tulane university (new orleans,
    louisiana) reflects the historical development of the civil law
    (the continental europe system, as louisiana was a colony of
    france and spain before its purchase by the usa in 1803) and
    common law (anglo-american) systems. it has a collection of
    over 200,000 volumes. although the ultimate responsibility for
    book selection and collection development rests with the head
    law librarian, all librarians, faculty, and students are
    encouraged to make suggestions. a special course in legal
    research and writing is given by the law librarian as a
    required course for all freshmen j.d. students and introductory
    lectures in legal research are given to the graduate
    students.
