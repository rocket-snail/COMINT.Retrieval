scattering of plane waves by locally homogeneous
    dielectric noise when plane waves are scattered by locally
    homogeneous dielectric noise random refractive index
    fluctuations and observed in the fraunhofer region it is found
    that the local structure of the noise determines the average
    scattered power received at a fixed point whereas its overall
    structure determines the space correlations of the radiation
    received at two different points
