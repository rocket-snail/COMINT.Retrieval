graphical determination of the operating characteristic
    of a magnetic amplifier a method of constructing a performance
    characteristic for a magnetic amplifier is described based on
    the equivalent circuit derived earlier of october bernard and
    pio taking account of the nonlinearity of the associated
    rectifier and expressing output current as a function of
    current in the control circuit
