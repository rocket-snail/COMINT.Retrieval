the danish publishing world abroad or the children's book
    fair in bologna 1981. the 1981 fair illustrated the miserable
    nature of present-day publishing but was a true picture of
    children's literature, 80% of which consists of comics,
    picture-books and coloured books, all in poor taste. children's
    books in general are at a low level-the tv screen in book
    form-and the question is whether colours and pictures sell
    whereas culture does not. scandinavian book production differs
    markedly from that of other countries in variety, breadth and
    well-defined taste but is in an obviously scandinavian style.
    the 1981 bologna fair was dull, with little new or
    outstandingly interesting, and business also appeared to be
    poor and mostly concerned with joint book-production in
    different countries. joint production enables danish publishers
    to issue quality picture books but also has increasingly become
    the means by which danish books can appear in other
    countries.
