libraries and the two cultures. paper presented at
    library history seminar vi 'libraries & culture', austin,
    texas, 19-22 mar 80. culture may mean an acquaintance with the
    best that has been known and said in the world, and the whole
    congeries of ways in which a particular people construct
    buildings, manufacture artifacts, worship deities, make war and
    love, raise children, and live with one another. traces the
    historical relationship between libraries and the 2 cultures,
    contending that the makeup of societies and cultures that are
    thousands of years old is not much influenced by the small
    number who seek culture, and libraries remain peripheral in the
    culture of the people as a whole.
