problems of cataloguing and classification in theater
    librarianship. problems in cataloguing and classifying theatre
    resources have significantly contributed to the difficulties of
    theatre librarianship. the unsuitability of major existing
    classification systems for use with theatre collections has
    prompted librarians to seek alternatives, such as modifications
    and original classifications. additionally, collections of
    non-book, or 'fugitive', theatrical memorabilia are practically
    impossible to catalogue properly, given the desperate financial
    situation facing many theatre collections. us survey data on
    current practices indicate a strong trend toward
    standardisation of procedures in classifying, yet a continuing
    diversity in cataloguing methods. the coming of computer
    technology, along with increased awareness among theatre
    librarians and input from concerned professional organisations,
    may help alleviate some of these problems in the future.
