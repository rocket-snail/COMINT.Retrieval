the analysis of fading records from spaced receivers
    fading records obtained in investigating ionospheric winds by
    the spaced receiver method described by mitra of and phillips o
    are discussed considerable variability in the records is to be
    expected even if the wind is constant in both direction and
    magnitude two particular one hour records for vertical
    incidence reflection from the e layer are analysed one is
    consistent with constant wind conditions the other requires
    more detailed analysis
