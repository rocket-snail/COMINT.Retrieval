preliminary studies of the distribution of auroras in
    alaska the analysis of auroral observations for from five
    stations spread over alaska shows a zone at geomagnetic
    latitude for which the incidence of auroras is independent of
    magnetic activity at geomagnetic latitudes south of the
    incidence of auroras is markedly dependent upon magnetic
    activity
