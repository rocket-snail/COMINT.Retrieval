the effect of proton gyration in the outer atmosphere
    represented on the dispersion curve of whistler whistlers
    observed at kyoto geomagnetic latitude reach a height of km the
    dispersion of a very pure whistler at kyoto in was measured
    from to less than and compared with that calculated using the
    complete dispersion law it is concluded that the dispersion was
    influenced by the effect of proton gyration
