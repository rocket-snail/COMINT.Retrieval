on magnetic permeability for the case of magnetization
    under the action of a circular alternating field in the
    presence of a dc longitudinal field a method is described for
    measuring the permeability of a torsion free iron wire results
    are given for various values of the circular alternating field
    the longitudinal field and the wire tension
