geac in action at the university of hull. the geac
    terminals at hull university are standard, comprising keyboard,
    vdu and lightpen and the system is run on a geac 8000 mini.
    files are stored on 2x300 megabyte discs. since hull had no
    existing machine-readable catalogue, a full record of all stock
    had to be compiled. the automated circulation control system at
    present operates only on a small section of the stock, but it
    is hoped to extend this to all classes. economic stringency
    obliged hull to discard its flexible and effective manual
    system and replace it with an efficient and easily-used system.
    geac fulfilled the university's needs, and the partial system
    operating at present meets hull's requirements.
