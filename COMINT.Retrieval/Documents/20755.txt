effect of nuclear polarization on the behaviour of solid
    state masers an account is given of experiments conducted on a
    ruby sample placed in a doubly resonant microwave cavity with
    bloembergen stimulation the application of r f power to a coil
    round the sample produced an increase in amplifier gain the
    effect being greatest at the resonance frequency of the free ai
    nuclei
