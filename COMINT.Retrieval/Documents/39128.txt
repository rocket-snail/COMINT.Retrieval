selection of molecular fragment features for
    structure-activity studies in antitumour screening. the
    national cancer institute developmental therapeutics program
    screens about 13,000 compounds per year for antitumour activity
    in a mouse prescreen. a method for predicting activity uses
    molecular fragment features of potential acquisitions. this
    paper covers some details about how the set of features was
    chosen, filling a gap in earlier publications.
