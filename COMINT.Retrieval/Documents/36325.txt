ime shared amplifier stabilizes computers drift in the dc
    operational amplifiers of analogue computers is reduced by
    connecting them periodically to the output of an auxiliary
    stabilizing amplifier the advantages of using a direct coupled
    rather than a chopper type of amplifier for this purpose are
    indicated circuit details are described including the switching
    and filtering arguments
