between gin and twin' meeting the information needs of
    the third world. agreement was reached at the un conference on
    science and technology for development on the establishment of
    a global information network (gin). however, due to the lack of
    interest on the part of the industrialised countries and
    absence of financial support, gin is likely to remain a paper
    agreement. even if it were established, it would do little to
    fulfil the real science information needs of the third world. a
    better alternative for developing countries would be to share
    locally produced science and technology information amongst
    themselves and develop twin (a third world information network)
    to meet their specific needs and requirements. there are
    indications that such a system is randomly evolving in the
    middle east.
