the brownian movement of linear and nonlinear systems the
    application of brownian movement analysis to systems with a
    nonlinear relaxation mechanism eg electrical conductivity is
    considered a statistical hypothesis is proposed which enables a
    calculation to be made of the brownian movement and
    corresponding frequency spectrum of such systems the results
    are relevant to the study of electrical noise
