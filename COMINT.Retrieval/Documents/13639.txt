a travelling wave ferromagnetic amplifier amplification
    of signal power can be obtained in a propagating structure
    which is partially or totally embedded in a ferromagnetic
    medium it is shown that one form of the structure possesses two
    propagating modes and can also support a travelling wave
    supplied by a local oscillator which provi es through the
    magnetic changes a time varying coupling between the two
    propagating modes the principle of operation is illustrated by
    a simple transmission line model
