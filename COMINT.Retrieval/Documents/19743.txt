the spectrum of radio star scintillations and the nature
    of irregularities in the ionosphere simultaneous observations
    of the intense source in cygnus were made with a frequency
    sweep spectroscope a frequency sweep interferometer and a
    triangular spaced aerial receiving system most fluctuations are
    due to focusing by single lens like irregularities the
    fluctuation amplitude shows tow maxima one near midnight the
    other near midday for day time conditions at least the
    elongation of the pattern at the ground indicates marked
    anisotropy in the ionosphere irregularities
