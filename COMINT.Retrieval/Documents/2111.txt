the cathode coupled multivibrator considered as a coupled
    pair of two therminal networks the multivibrator is considered
    as an active two terminal network with negative differential
    resistance together with a passive two terminal network
    formulae derived on this basis for determining the
    multivibrator operating characteristics give results in close
    agreement with experimental values
