investigation of rectification properties of se hgse
    contact the experimentally determined rectification coefficient
    maximum occurring at is for pure se and for se current voltage
    characteristics were investigated for rectifiers with the hese
    prepared by exposing se to hg vapour or to liquid hg se
    crystallized at various rates and temperatures various
    electrode base materials and se of two different grades of
    purity the results are shown graphically
