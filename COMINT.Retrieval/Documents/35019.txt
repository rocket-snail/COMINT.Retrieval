compensation of the temperature effect in lc circuits by
    means of negative coefficient capacitors compensation at a
    given frequency is obtained by connecting in parallel with a
    variable capacitor a series arrangement of a fixed negative
    coefficient capacitor and a variable capacitor the experimental
    method of adjustment is described frequency variation with
    temperature for uncompensated settings is studied
