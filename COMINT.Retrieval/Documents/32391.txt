investigation of the transverse thermomagnetic effect the
    potential difference produced between faces of a conductor
    perpendicular to the applied magnetic field and perpendicular
    to the thermal flow was measured and found to be proportional
    to the magnetization in weak fields hysteresis is observed at
    saturation the potential difference remains constant a formula
    similar to that representing the hall effect is given the
    results for low carbon steel are shown graphically
