the isotropic component of cosmic radio frequency
    radiation possible sources of the isotropic component deduced
    by westerhout and oort of february are discussed the integrated
    radition from normal extragalactic nebulae is shown to be
    inadequate to account for the observations which may be
    explained on the basis of collisions between galaxies the
    intensity to be expected depends strongly on the cosmological
    theory assumed hence accurate measurements of the extragalactic
    component may yield information of value for distinguishing
    between different theories
