halo of radio emission and the origin of cosmic rays
    observations of radiation from nebulae indicate that a large
    fraction of the radiation comes from roughly spherical regions
    centred on the galactic centre and having radii of about
    kiloparsecs the particle density and energy conditions in these
    regions are considered in relation to the acceleration of
    cosmic rays
