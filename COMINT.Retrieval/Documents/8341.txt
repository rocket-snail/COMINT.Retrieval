electromagnetic and acoustic scattering by a semi
    infinite body of revolution theory developed by kline of is
    used to determine the scattering of a plane wave incident along
    the axis of a perfectly reflecting body for the case of a
    paraboloid the solution of the em problem is obtained exactly
    in closed form the results are compared with those obtained
    from consideration of current distribution as in below
