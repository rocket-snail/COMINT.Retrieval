india's libraries are waiting. outlines the present
    unstable political and economic situation in india. only 5
    states have library laws, operating with integrated library
    systems. the laws are, however, weak and financing of libraries
    inadequate. at union level, library legislation was the subject
    of a committee proposal put forward in 1964, but with lack of
    interest among the authorities, no action has been taken yet.
    in the meantime, libraries face challenges from increasing
    numbers of users, the newly literate and students. there are
    many library types; apart from the national library in
    calcutta, there are state central, district, block, village,
    mobile, university, college and school libraries. libraries of
    various associations and subscription libraries are numerous.
    but the need for resources, and perhaps a successor to the
    dynamic s.r. ranganathan, is great.
