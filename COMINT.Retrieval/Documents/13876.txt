the impact of microcomputers on data communication
    networks. critically examines, from several points of view, the
    impact of the microprocessor on data communication networks;
    analyses the use of microcomputers in the functional components
    of such networks; reviews specific areas where microcomputers
    have, can or should take over and expand functions previously
    performed by random logic; indicates future trends in
    microprocessor applications to data communication; and analyses
    the conflicting influences on the rate of utilisation of
    microprocessors.
