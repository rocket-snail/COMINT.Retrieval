particle transport electric currents and pressure balance
    in a magnetically immobilized plasma an analysis of a plasma
    immobilized by a magnetic field shows that each kind of charged
    particle has a general drift perpendicular to the gradient of
    the field but that there is no corresponding electric current
    density there is an exact cancellation arising from the
    gradient of the larmor radius the current density which is
    present arises exclusively from the particle density gradient
    and is not associated with any drift of matter
