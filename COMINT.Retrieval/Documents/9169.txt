the temperature variation of the frequency of at and bt
    cut quartz resonators measured frequency temperature
    characteristics can be represented analytically as power series
    three terms being sufficient to deal with the temperature range
    the influence of the order of overtone on the temperature
    coefficient is discussed see also of february
