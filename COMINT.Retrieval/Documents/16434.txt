survey of czech and slovak periodicals and bulletins on
    librarianship and informatics. more than 20 periodicals,
    newsletters and other papers dealing with the theory and
    practice of librarianship and information science are listed.
    the slovak citatel' and its czech counterpart ctenar now cater
    for libraries in general. although originally designed with
    public libraries in mind. other periodicals are more
    specialised, dealing with the problems of scientific, technical
    and economic libraries and information centres in industry; in
    university, college and school libraries and libraries in the
    national health service establishments. their editorial staff
    make every effort to impart information to their readers, not
    only on library routines and techniques, but also some insight
    into the readers psychology, the situation in a similar field
    abroad, the latest publications, important events of public
    interest and the like. a special newsletter takes up
    construction of library buildings , their furnishing and
    equipment, book collections and cataloguing. although slovak
    trade unions as well as museum and agricultural libraries still
    lack periodicals of their own, the choice is wide and no
    librarian and/or information scientist need be behind the
    times.
