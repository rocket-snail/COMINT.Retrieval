phase fluctuations in a valve generator the effect of
    shot noise on an oscillator operating in the steady state is
    considered theoretically the intensity and the statistical
    properties of the shot current are independent of the feedback
    circuit and can thus be represented by a separate noise current
    generator in parallel with the oscillator analysis is presented
    on the basis of such an equivalent circuit
