the distortion of fm signals in passive networks
    expressions for the fundamental and first four harmonics of the
    output instantaneous frequency are given in a series expansion
    in terms of modulation frequency and modulation index the
    coefficients in the expansion depending on the network
    parameters effects of detuning are considered and detailed
    results for the butterworth circuit are presented
