digital input for precision variable oscillators details
    are given of a signal generator for the frequency range the
    drive unit is a voltage controlled oscillator regulated by the
    difference in width between standard pulses and pulses whose
    duration is that of the time required for the oscillations fed
    to a counter unit to equal a preset number
