a synthesis procedure the synthesis of symmetrical
    reactance networks with equal terminations is considered from
    the insertion loss characteristic the impedance which the half
    circuit presents at the axis of symmetry is derived from
    network theory and the complete circuit is obtained by back to
    back connection of the two halves
