the effect of sunrise on the reflection height of low
    frequency waves the observed sudden changes of phase and
    amplitude of waves transmitted over distances of are discussed
    in relation to the geometry of the system at the change over
    from night time to daytime reflection height and respectively
    the effect cannot be due to photoionization of atmospheric
    molecules but may be due to the removal of electrons from
    negative oxygen ions by visible and near infrared radiation
    calculations are presented giving support to this view the rate
    of fall of the reflection height is discussed
