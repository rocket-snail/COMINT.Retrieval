what about the non-users of the public library?. the
    controversy concerning the relative importance of the public
    library of the user 2versus1 the non-user of the library
    service is considered. the implication is that the library can
    be effective only if it applies its resources towards meeting
    the cultural needs of the whole community. south africa in the
    main lacks research on community needs relevant to library
    services. research on the non-user in the uk, the usa and south
    africa is briefly reviewed. the library should meet cultural
    needs from the viewpoint of the user and not of the librarian.
    this makes the public library the most complex of all library
    types because of its diverse user types. an example is given of
    how the cape town city libraries changed its policy in
    selecting children's books to satisfy its users' needs more
    adequately.
