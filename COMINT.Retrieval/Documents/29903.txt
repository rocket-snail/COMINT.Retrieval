wide rf level rf unit for an nmr spectrometer this unit
    makes use of a crystal controlled oscillator for frequency
    stability and positive feedback to increase the effective q of
    the sample rf coil the circuit is well suited to saturation
    studies and relaxation time measurements in nuclear magnetic
    resonance investigations
