the advancement of reading at work. the factory library
    should provide literature for all staff, especially the
    workers. it is difficult to obtain accurate information on the
    reading habits of different social groups; workers probably
    comprise more than 1/8 but less then 1/2 of a factory library's
    readers. the factory library is the library most likely to
    promote reading among the working classes. in factory
    libraries, as opposed to public libraries, there are more adult
    readers than teenage readers and more male readers than female.
    many people consider that adults need to read more than the
    young and that the workers who do read, even if only light
    literature, will have more active and communicative
    personalities than non-readers and make a larger contribution
    to productivity.
