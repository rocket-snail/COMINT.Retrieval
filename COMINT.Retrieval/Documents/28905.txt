problems with sources of information in international law
    and relations' the case of the world-wide treaty jungle.
    libraries are required to provide bibliographical guidance to
    and through the 'treaty jungle' engendered by the diversity of
    national and international interests caused by the recent
    dramatic increase in the number of independent nation states.
    the degree of accessibility to treaty information is much
    greater than before' treaty information is no longer the
    preserve of government officials, thanks to publications like
    the united nations treaty series. there is still a need,
    however, for a bibliography of currently published treaty
    collections and treaties in force. the many problems still
    faced in gaining access to treaty information can only be
    solved by international cooperation and better support for the
    united nations treaty section.
