the variation with current and inductance of metal
    transfer between platinum contacts continuation of
    investigation described previously of warham curves of the net
    transfer are given for currents and inductances in the ranges
    and respectively four different types of transfer termed bridge
    short arc long arc and reversed short arc may be involved the
    results indicate that the life of pt contacts could be improved
    by controlling the effective circuit inductance at break to
    about
