theory of ac space charge polarization effects in
    photoconductors semiconductors and electrolytes linear theory
    is developed for solid or liquid materials containing charge
    carriers which can move freely within the material but are
    blocked by the electrodes the carriers may be electrons holes
    ions or ion vacancies the general solution for the admittance
    of the material is obtained for an arbitrary ratio between the
    mobilities of positive and negative carriers and is discussed
    for some special cases results are compared compared with those
    derived from other theories
