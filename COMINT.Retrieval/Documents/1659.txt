legal information from european documentation centres.
    the commission of the european communities has established a
    number of european documentation centres and depository
    libraries in the uk and throughout the world which contain
    collections of the official publications of the eec. despite
    difficulties in the acquisition and exploitation of these
    materials there is much of interest to law libraries.
