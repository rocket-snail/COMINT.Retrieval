research technology' a study of the spread of spectral
    methods by analysing publications. shows how an analysis of
    parallel scientific journals in various countries can indicate
    the dynamics of the spread of scientific instruments and
    methods, the level of scientific achievement, and the structure
    of science in those countries. uses this method to study the
    dynamics of the spread of infrared and nuclear magnetic
    resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry in the uk, usa,
    france, and west germany during 1960-77. articles in 2journal
    of organic chemistry1 and 2journal of agricultural and food
    chemistry1 are compared to evaluate the speed of spectroscopic
    methods transfer from fundamental to applied science and the
    ratio of methods used in the latter discipline.
