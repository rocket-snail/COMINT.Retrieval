geomagnetic bay disturbances and their nonuniform induced
    components within the earth the bay disturbance is considered
    as the field of a travelling dipole in the auroral zone the
    direction of travel depending on time of day the induced
    component within the earth exhibits local variations depending
    on the conductivity a dynamic anomaly is observed in an area in
    central europe the vertical component being a maximum in the
    north and a minimum in the south when the ionosphere current is
    directed southward
