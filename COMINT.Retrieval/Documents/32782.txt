a dala project 25 years ago. describes the 1st dala
    project carried out in 1956-58 by the author and financed
    initially by lottery money gained by dalarna library
    association. the aim was to reach new library users. after a
    scant examination of the available literature the author began
    seeking potential user groups such as societies for housewives,
    farmers, pensioners, and schools. contacts were made and
    letters written. book exhibitions and book talks were arranged
    at meetings of the societies. a proper evaluation of the
    project was not made, although some figures are available in
    uppsala university's sociological survey on leisure habits in
    dalarna published in 1959. the author left in 1958, but the
    project was carried on by others in a limited form until 1966,
    and a new project is due to start in autumn 81.
