krantel-a joint venture by dutch newspapers. the progress
    being made in the netherlands to make newspapers available
    through the viditel viewdata service of the dutch post office
    is reported. krantel is a project designed to help newspapers
    take advantage of the opportunities offered by viewdata.
    although 10 newspapers have experimented with their own
    viewdata systems, commercial activity is low, and some reasons
    for this are suggested.
