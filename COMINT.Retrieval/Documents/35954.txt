on the temperature of electrons in a plasma in a variable
    electric field the investigation shows that the electron gas
    can exist in two stable states with different temperatures
    transition from one state to another occurs at certain critical
    values of the field and is followed by a considerable change in
    the electron temperature a particular type of hysteresis is
    noted in the dependence of the electron temperature on the
    field amplitude and frequency expressions for the complex
    conductivity of the plasma are also derived
