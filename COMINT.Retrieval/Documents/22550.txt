functions and aims of italian school libraries. books by
    themselves do not create a school library. it should constitute
    an integral part of the communications and information
    processes, interacting with the pupil. classified catalogues
    combined with open access have an important role. the scheme
    will usually be dewey decimal or occasionally library of
    congress but the flexible colon classification also merits
    consideration.
