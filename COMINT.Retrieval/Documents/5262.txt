the representation of ladder network parameters through
    continued fraction polynomials euler polynomials are used to
    derive concise expressions for the transmission parameters of
    linear ladder networks in terms of the branch and terminating
    immittances a generalized form of the polynomials is helpful in
    the design of reactively coupled multiple tuned narrow band
    pass filters
