maximum power transfer in transistor amplifiers the
    theoretical treatment of transistor amplifier performance is
    simplified by restricting consideration to the condition of
    maximum power transfer when it is possible to make a rapid
    assessment of the available power gain for a particular
    configuration in terms of the transistor parameters curves show
    the relation between maximum power gain current gain and
    transistor constants for grounded base and grounded collector
