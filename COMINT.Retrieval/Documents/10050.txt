fundamental problems of hf and if amplifiers for tv
    reception part gain and bandwidth the gain bandwidth product gb
    is shown to depend exclusively on the ratio of valve mutual
    conductance to the sum of input and output capacitances factors
    affecting g and b are discussed amplifier response curves are
    considered and the total bandwidth is deduced for amplifiers
    with synchronous circuits staggered tuning is discussed in
    detail the unit function response curves for double and
    vestigial sideband systems are treated and the distortion in
    the latter system is analysed the gain and bandwidth of
    quadripole coupling networks particularly the network and the
    double tuned band pass filter are discussed and characteristic
    data including gb values are tabulated for nine commonly used
    pentode circuits data for unit function response curves when
    several identical groups are connected in cascade and bandwidth
    factor for double tuned coupling circuits are also
    tabulated
