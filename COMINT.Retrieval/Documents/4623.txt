pulsations of the earths electromagnetic field with
    periods of to seconds and their connection with phenomena in
    the high atmosphere pulsations are closely correlated with
    aurora and the various phases of magnetic storms the time of
    onset of a storm sudden commencement determined from pulsation
    data appears to be the same within a few seconds over the whole
    world
