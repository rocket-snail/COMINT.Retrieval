design of triode flip flops for long term stability
    description of an analytical method of design based on
    considerations of dc stability limiting tolerances in respect
    of voltage and component values being taken into account
    initially an eccles jordan circuit with injection diodes is
    considered as a general case and equations are derived
    expressing the operating conditions in the grid and the anode
    circuits solution of these equations gives appropriate key
    values the method is applied to three special cases and a
    numerical example is given
