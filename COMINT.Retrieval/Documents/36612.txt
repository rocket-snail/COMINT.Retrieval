phase distortionless limiting by a parametric method
    nearly ideal limiting can be obtained by using the signal to be
    limited as the pump frequency nonlinear capacitance amplifiers
    an account of the physical principles and the design of
    variable capacitance amplifiers the effective noise
    temperatures achieved are compared with those of other low
    noise amplifiers and of terrestrial and extraterrestrial noise
