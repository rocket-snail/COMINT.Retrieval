charge transfer reactions an improved method for
    determining charge transfer cross sections is applied to
    symmetric and unsymmetric reactions for a large number of gases
    and gives higher values than originally reported a comparison
    of the rates of collisional processes in the d e and f region
    shows that the charge transfer rate is much larger than that
    for any other collisional process in the upper atmosphere see
