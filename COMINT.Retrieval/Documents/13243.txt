translating and online. paper presented at the aslib
    technical translation group conference, london, 20 nov 80.
    information can be retrieved by direct interrogation by a
    remote computer by means of a keyboard terminal and a
    telephone. the advantages of such an on-line system are fast
    access to large quantities of data and the opportunity to
    refine the enquiry by conversing with the computer. at present,
    data bases can be used to determine if a translation of a
    document, or an alternative, already exists. they can assist
    with translating particular words or phrases, especially in new
    subject areas. in the future, on-line systems may be exploited
    to produce more sophisticated aids, reflecting the structure of
    language.
