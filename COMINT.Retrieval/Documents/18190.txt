on the influence of electron ion diffusion on the
    electron density and height of the nocturnal layer the
    influence of the earths magnetic field on electron ion
    diffusion will tend to reduce the atmospheric density in the
    region at night a lower limit for the maximum density of the
    value suddested in the earlier paper is possible other
    considerations tend to confirm the value originally suggested
    which agrees with extrapolations from rocket data if the true
    height of the layer is about
