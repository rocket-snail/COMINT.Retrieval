the rotation of the first russian earth satellite fading
    records obtained during transits over cambridge at about ut
    october have been examined the records show a discontinuous
    change in fading rate at the time of nearest approach this is
    attributed to changes in polarization in certain aspects of the
    satellite relative to the observer caused by the generation of
    a cone by the rotating aerial it is concluded that the
    satellite rotated at rev min generating a cone of semi angle
    the direction of the rotating axis being at to the direction of
