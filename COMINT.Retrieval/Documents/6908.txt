unambiguous choice of arrow direction for currents and
    voltages in quadripoles with applications to directional
    quadripoles and gyrators it is recommended that the positive
    direction of the voltage arrow should always point from
    positive to o negative charge with quadripole diagrams the
    output current arrow should poin away from the quadripole
    simplifications of network analysis resulting from adoption of
    this convention are indicated
