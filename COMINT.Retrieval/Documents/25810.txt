the h t measurement of ionosphere at the time of the
    annular eclipse of may at wakkanai hokkaido in japan
    measurements were made at frequencies of and the results
    obtained show that the absorption in and below the e layer
    decreased as the eclipse approached its maximum and increased
    again after the maximum phase the maximum f layer electron
    density began to decrease immediately after first contact and
    continued to decrease to a minimum about min after the maximum
    phase of the eclipse then recovering
