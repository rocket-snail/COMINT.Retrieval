new hf proximity effect formula arnolds results of are
    somewhat complex a new asymptotic formula was therefore
    developed which is valid whenever the proximity effect is so
    great that the resistance of the apir of parallel conductors is
    more than doubled a combination of the maxwell equation and
    integral equation approaches is used in deriving the new
    impedance formula which is rigorous and very simple
