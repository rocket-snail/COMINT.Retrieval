growing electromagnetic waves this growth of waves is
    considered in terms of baileys electromagneto ionic theory of
    the different wave modes predicted by this theory four are
    unreal the remainder comprise two pairs of hydromagnetic waves
    which become pure waves at a sufficiently high frequency one
    pair of modified sound waves and one pair of modified electron
    sound waves the growth of the waves may result from the
    trappings of ions between potential troughs of the space charge
    wave and the subsequent surrender of energy by the ions ion
    drifts may introduce important effects not indicated by the
    wave equations
