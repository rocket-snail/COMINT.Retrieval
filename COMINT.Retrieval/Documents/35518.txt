research on submillimetre wave generation and techniques
    experiments and experimental equipment are described for
    investigations on sub mm wave generation including a
    tornadotron in which em radiation is produced by the action f
    of pulsed magnetic fields of the order of on a trapped electron
    cloud aspects of instrumentation suitable for these frequencies
    are briefly discussed
