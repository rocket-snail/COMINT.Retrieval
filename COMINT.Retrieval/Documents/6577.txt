electron density in the upper atmosphere and
    interpretation of the hf curves of ionosphere virtual height
    for the case of vertical incidence and the geomagnetic latitude
    of rome an expression is developed for the group refractive
    index using appletons formula absorption is neglected the
    optical path of em waves totally or partially reflected or
    transmitted through an ionosphere layer is determined as a
    function of frequency for various cases the results are applied
    in conjunction with experimental hf curves to derive linear
    relations giving directly the thickness of the layer and its
    height above the ground cases of single and superposed layers
    are treated
