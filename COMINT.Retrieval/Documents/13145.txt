on the complexity of lr(k) testing the problem of
    determining whether an arbitrary context-free grammar is a
    member of some easily parsed subclass of grammars such as the
    lr(k) grammars is considered. the time complexity of this
    problem is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed
    integer and when k is considered to be a parameter of the test.
    in the first case, it is shown that for every k there exists an
    o(n(k+2)) algorithm for testing the lr(k) property, where n is
    the size of the grammar in question. on the other hand, if both
    k and the subject grammar are problem parameters, then the
    complexity of the problem depends very strongly on the
    representation chosen for k. more specifically, it is shown
    that this problem is np-complete when k is expressed in unary.
    when k is expressed in binary the problem is complete for
    nondeterministic exponential time. these results carry over to
    many other parameterized classes of grammars, such as the
    ll(k), strong ll(k), slr(k), lc(k), and strong lc(k) grammars.
