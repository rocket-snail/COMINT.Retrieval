electro fusion a new phenomenon observed in the phase
    changes of dielectrics under the influence of an electric field
    experiments are described which indicate that application of a
    field between the electrodes of a capacitor with the dielectric
    partly in the solid and partly in the liquid state accelerates
    the phase change in the dielectric from measurements of the
    current and calculation of the joule energy dissipated it is
    shown that this energy is several hundred times smaller than
    the heat necessary for the normal fusion of the corresponding
    mass of the dielectric
