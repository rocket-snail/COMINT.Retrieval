magnetic fields in small ferrite bodies with applications
    to microwave cavities containing such bodies an analysis is
    presented of the field inside small spheres and cylinders of
    ferrite excited by circularly of linearly polarized magnetic
    fields in cavities the formulae derived are used to calculate
    the detuning and change of value of the cavity on introducing
    the ferrite body or conversely to determine the ferrite
    permeability tensor from the observed changes in the cavity
    characteristics
