limit of applicability of the method of smooth
    perturbations i the problem of wave propagation through a
    medium with inhomogeneities mean square values of the phase and
    amplitude fluctuations and of the amplitude correlation
    function are discussed conditions are determined under which
    the effect of the layer with inhomogeneities on the traversing
    radiation can be replaced by the perturbation action of an
    equivalent phase screen
