kinetic temperature of electrons in metals and anomalous
    electron emission the effect of strong electric fields on
    metals is to raise the temperature of the electrons above that
    of the lattice the symmetrical part of the electron energy
    distribution is a ferm distribution function the asymmetric
    part is negligible in the cases considered quantitative
    estimates of the effect of the electron temperature rise on
    conduction and emission are briefly discussed
