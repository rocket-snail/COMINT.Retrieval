the role of psychology in the professional training of
    library staff. librarians need to have an understanding of
    psychology in order to provide effective reading guidance to
    library users. psychology should be an integral part of the
    syllabus taught in library schools, with a study of general
    principles leading on to more specialised fields. the course
    taught at the leningradskii gosudarstvennyi institut kul'tury
    im. n.k. krupskoi (n.k. krupskaya state institute of culture in
    leningrad) shows some of the possibilities available, but there
    is much work to be done in the profession as a whole.
