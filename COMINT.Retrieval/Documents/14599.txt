the public libraries in sweden. contribution to an issue
    devoted to public library services in sweden. sweden's public
    library network is well developed and reaches large groups of
    the population through its outreach activities. recent studies
    show that almost &h the adult population and 80-90% of the
    children and young people have visited a library in the last
    year. modern developments have accelerated during the 1970s
    largely because of the fusion of local authorities. sweden has
    no libraries act, but the swedish parliament decided to
    introduce a system of state grants to public libraries and
    regional library activities. state grants amount to 2.5% of the
    total operating costs of public libraries, but they have played
    a large role in the development of libraries thanks to their
    strategic deployment.
