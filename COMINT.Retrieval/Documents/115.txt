theory of single resonance parametric amplifiers a
    parametric amplifier that supports a resonance at the idler
    frequency only is capable of unlimited gain when operated
    either as a straight through amplifier or as a lower sideband
    ur converter this makes feasible a continuously tunable
    parametric receiver
