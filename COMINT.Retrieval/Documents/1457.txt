it is useless to economise when money is in short supply.
    the german economy is adapting with difficulty to the
    recession, to the detriment of public budgets. culture is
    important during economic crises, therefore cultural bodies
    cannot renege on their social responsibilities. thrift may not
    always be the most economic procedure. an analysis is made of
    statistics on library expenditure by large and small local
    authorities in west germany in 1975-79 to illustrate the
    importance of the relationship between staffing costs and the
    total budget. a careful library policy must recognise the
    possibilities and limitations of adapting to the financial
    situation in the light of its social responsibilities. if
    rationalisation methods are carried out efficiently, the
    library service can adapt in the right way.
