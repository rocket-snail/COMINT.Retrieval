citation analysis significance of scientific journals.
    the application of methods of quantitative analysis makes it
    possible to evaluate the impact of scientific journals on one
    another. these methods are used to determine the significance
    of similar scientific journals by their cross-citations, taking
    into account data from the journal citation reports (jcr). they
    also help to improve the jcr structure and widen its uses for
    the evaluation of scientific journals. these methods are
    applied to analyse critically the principles of ranking
    journals in package 1 and the tabular contents of jcr's
    packages 2 and 3, as well as to study frequency distribution of
    the journals both in time and space.
