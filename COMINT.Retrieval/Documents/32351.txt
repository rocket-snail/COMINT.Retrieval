distributed routing. in distributed routing each node
    receives some information about the network from its adjacent
    nodes and uses the information to determine the manner in which
    it forwards its traffic. gives 3 examples of distributed
    routing in a data communication network. a routing algorithm is
    then given where a generalised distributed routing procedure
    proposes a flow change and a central node determines the
    optimal scale of the proposed change.
