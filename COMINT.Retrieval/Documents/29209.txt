computation of the bounding surface of a dipole field in
    a plasma by a moment technique the cavity formed by a plasma
    free dipole magnetic field in a field free stationary plasma is
    determined by a numerical method a possible extension of the
    theory to determine the shape of the cavity produced in the
    solar wind by the geomagnetic field is indicated
