the influence of individual variations in the field
    changes due to lightning discharges upon the design and
    performance of lightning flash counters flash counters
    responding only to the component of the field change are likely
    to be least subject to error this implies a preferential
    selection of very low frequencies examples are given indicating
    the extent of the inaccuracies encountered from statistics of
    rates of flashing and duration of discharges it is concluded
    that counters should have an insensitive period of about the
    design of counters is discussed and a simple circuit is
    presented
