the investigation of ionospheric absorption by a new
    automatic method part measurements on oblique incidence
    broadcast signals apparatus similar to that described in part
    of june is used for recording the strength of a signal received
    from a distant transmitter by reflection from the ionosphere
    comparison of the vertical incidence records with
    simultaneously obtained oblique incidence records is expected
    to facilitate the investigation of winds in the
    ionosphere
