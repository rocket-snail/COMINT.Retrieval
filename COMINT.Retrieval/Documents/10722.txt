conductivity of plasmas to microwaves the complex
    conductivity is calculated for a neutral plasma with electrons
    having a distribution in space and velocity which does not
    change over a time interval long compared with the period of
    the microwave field the conductivity is derived for velocity
    distributions given by the dirac function a step function and a
    maxwellian distribution
