hydromagnetic interpretation of sudden commencements of
    magnetic storms a model is proposed in which the impact of
    solar plasma on the geomagnetic field generates a shock wave
    the compressional shock wave propagates to the earth as a
    longitudinal hydromagnetic wave in low latitudes and generates
    transverse hydromagnetic waves in the exosphere which propagate
    to high latitudes along the field lines a reversed impulse at
    latitudes above is explained in terms of the direction of the
    magnetic perturbation vector at the top of the
    ionosphere
