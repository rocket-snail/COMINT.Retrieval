greens functions for the cylinder and the sphere the
    investigation of diffraction of is continued the exact
    expression for the greens function is split into two parts
    corresponding respectively to the geometrical optics wave and
    the surface wave a semi asymptotic solution is thus obtained
    which is valid for quite small obstacles the surface waves are
    shown to be identical with the residual waves discussed by
    watson and by van der pol and bremmer in connection with
    wireless telegraphy
