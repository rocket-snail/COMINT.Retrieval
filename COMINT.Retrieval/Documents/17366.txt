radar methods of measuring the cislunar electron density
    six related techniques for measuring the integrated electron
    density between the earth and the moon are discussed these are
    based on the determination of the group retardation suffered by
    low frequency radar echoes very high peak power pulse technique
    or very high equipment stability cw technique would be required
    to measure absolute radar range but this difficulty can be
    avoided by sending a reference signal with the measuring signal
    the effects of path splitting electron blobs and lunar surface
    irregularities are considered
