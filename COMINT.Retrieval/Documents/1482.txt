amplitude stabilized low frequency oscillator the
    performance of a vlf oscillator for the range with the output
    stabilized by biased diodes or lamps is analysed formulae for
    the harmonic content with different initial damping are deduced
    and means of reducing it are indicated a circuit for measuring
    the harmonic content is described
