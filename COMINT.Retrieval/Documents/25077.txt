automated acquisitions systems' keynote address.
    contribution to the lita (american library association. library
    and information technology association) institute. librarians
    should be aware of the rapid progress being made toward
    integrated systems and make the acquisitions automation
    decision in that light. contrasts the mid-60s and early 80s in
    terms of technology and library needs. in the mid-60s, emphasis
    was on ordering, and technology was limiting both in terms of
    costs and capabilities. at the beginning of the 80s libraries
    have numerous acquisitions available, including turnkey systems
    from some circulation system vendors and the acquisitions
    subsystems of the bibliographic utilities. it is unlikely that
    a single source will offer a library the most suitable features
    for each function, and the problem becomes one of integrating
    systems from several sources.
