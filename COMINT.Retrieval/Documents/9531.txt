solar flares and association with the lower ionosphere
    short wave fade outs and are adopted as ionospheric parameters
    the statistical relations between these and solar flares and
    solar rf emission are studied the analysis includes flares from
    class down to class the number of fade outs is correlated with
    flare activity and with radio noise increases
