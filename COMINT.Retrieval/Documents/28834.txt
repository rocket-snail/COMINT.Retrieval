fabrication techniques for ceramic x band cavity
    resonators techniques are described for constructing cavity
    resonators for the x band from low thermal expansion ceramics a
    variety of mechanical arrangements is discussed q values as
    high as and frequency temperature coefficients as low as part
    in per have been obtained using simple processes
