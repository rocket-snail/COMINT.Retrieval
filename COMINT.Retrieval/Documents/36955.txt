the diffraction of waves in passing through an irregular
    refracting medium a relation is derived between the angular
    power spectrum of waves emerging from a thin diffracting screen
    random in two dimensions and the auto correlation function
    describing the irregularities of the field as it emerges from
    the diffracting screen the special case of an isotropic screen
    characterized by an auto correlation function which depends
    only on distance and not on direction is discussed for normal
    and oblique incidence multiple scattering of waves caused by
    volume irregularities of the dielectric constant is considered
    the angular power spectrum and the auto correlation function
    describing the irregularities of the diffraction field caused
    by multiple scattering in a thick slab are determined the
    results are compared with those obtained by hewish of for a
    thin phase changing screen the results are discussed in terms
    of problems arising in the study of radio wave
    propagation
