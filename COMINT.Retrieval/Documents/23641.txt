regenerative fractional frequency generators a self
    starting regenerative frequency divider circuit is described
    which has the advantages of simplicity and of lock in stability
    over a i wide range of frequencies an approximate analysis is
    given which shows the dependence of performance on diode
    characteristics and transistor input impedance
