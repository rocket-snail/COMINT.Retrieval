on the influence of horizontal motion of the neutral air
    on the diffusion equation of the f regin the equations of
    motion of a plasma in applied fields are discussed with
    reference to the f region the plasma sets the neutral air into
    motion horizontally within about but is not free to move
    vertically the consequences of this result on a world wide
    scale are discussed
