    partial fulfilment of requirements for an ma degree.) presents
    a picture of the unionisation of white-collar library staffs
    nationally and in a sample of british libraries. chapter 1
    shows the variety of unions recruiting such staff and sketches
    the roles played by nalgo, aut (association of university
    teachers), natfhe (national association of teachers of further
    and higher education), apt (association of polytechnic
    teachers) and astms (association of scientific, technical and
    managerial staffs). also discusses the part played by the
    library association and the relationship between these
    organisations. chapter 2 covers areas of concern of unions at
    national and local level under the headings' industrial
    relations; policy; education and training; and political
    concerns. chapter 3 comments on involvement of library staffs
    in union affairs and their attitudes to unions. chapter 4
    suggests alternative negotiating machinery for librarians in
    nalgo and the idea of forming a unified trade union.
