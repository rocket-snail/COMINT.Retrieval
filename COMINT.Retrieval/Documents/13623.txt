machine aid for switching circuit design an experimental
    special purpose non numerical computer for analysis of relay
    circuits has as its input a relay circuit together with the
    specification the circuit is intended to satisfy the analyser
    checks the circuit against the specification makes systematic
    attempts to simplify the circuit by removing redundant contacts
    and establishes lower limits for the numbers and types of
    contact needed to satisfy the specifications this method is
    compared with the method in which the same operations are
    performed by coding them on a general purpose digital
    computer
