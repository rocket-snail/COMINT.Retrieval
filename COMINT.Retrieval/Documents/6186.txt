computing polynomial resultants: bezout's determinant vs.
    collins' reduced p.r.s. algorithm algorithms for computing the
    resultant of two polynomials in several variables, a key
    repetitive step of computation in solving systems of polynomial
    equations by elimination, are studied. determining the best
    algorithm for computer implementation depends upon the extent
    to which extraneous factors are introduced, the extent of
    propagation of errors caused by truncation of real
    coefficients, memory requirements, and computing speed.
    preliminary considerations narrow the choice of the best
    algorithm to bezout's determinant and collins' reduced
    polynomial remainder sequence (p.r.s.) algorithm. detailed
    tests performed on sample problems conclusively show that
    bezout's determinant is superior in all respects except for
    univariate polynomials, in which case collins' reduced p.r.s.
    algorithm is somewhat faster. in particular bezout's
    determinant proves to be strikingly superior in numerical
    accuracy, displaying excellent stability with regard to
    round-off errors. results of tests are reported in detail.
