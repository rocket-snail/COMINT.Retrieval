the use of microforms in libraries. discusses both
    management and documentation applications in libraries in view
    of the increasing use of all types of microforms. the
    advantages of microforms are first summarised, then details
    given of how they are employed in loan systems such as
    photocharging; and in catalogues, whether open or closed, as
    microfilms or microfiches. the field of microdocumentation is
    then considered at length. all aspects of microreproduction are
    surveyed' microforms as part of general documentation,
    systematic microreproduction of holdings, private reproduction,
    microforms in interlibrary loan, and types of microforms in
    use; applications in micro-publishing are next discussed. in
    conclusion the problems which microforms raise in libraries are
    examined, both in producing them and in exploiting them
    fully.
