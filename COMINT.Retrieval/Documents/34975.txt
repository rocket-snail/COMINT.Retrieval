relationship between radio propagation disturbance
    geomagnetic activity and solar noise data on ionospheric
    disturbance of radio communication between new york and
    amsterdam during the years are compared with geomagnetic
    character figures a general correlation s is established the
    maximum radio disturbance showing a mean time lag of behind the
    maximum geomagnetic disturbance investigation of the relation
    between solar rf radiation and geomagnetic storms showed that a
    marked increase of the radiation on at least one of the
    frequencies and occurred at some time during the five days
    preceding a storm except in the case of recurrent storms
