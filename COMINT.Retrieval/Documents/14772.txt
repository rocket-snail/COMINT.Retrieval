individualized approach to learning library skills.
    contribution to a thematic issue on library use instruction.
    discusses the value of the individualised approach to learning
    library skills, and describes a number of activities currently
    being used in libraries which might be classified as
    individualised approaches. these are' signs; guides and
    handbooks; programmed instruction; computer-assisted
    instruction; learning packages; and psi (personalised system of
    instruction). it is argued that librarians may make more use of
    the individualised approach to learning during the
    1980s.
