application of a communicating word processor in an
    information department. a stand alone word processor (philips
    5002) is used to produce an information bulletin. a copy of the
    data is transmitted from the word processor to a mainframe
    computer where it is batch assimilated into an on-line data
    base. the on-line system (deco-unilever computer services ltd.)
    has all the features of the major commercial systems. in
    addition, it is possible to initiate the generation of printed
    indexes, either to the entire data base, or to a subset
    (hit-set) of data, during an on-line session. the versatility
    of the word processor and on-line search system are illustrated
    describing the various stages from a single keying step,
    through to bulletin, data base, and printed index
    production.
