the deutsche staatsbibliothek as a centre for
    inter-library loans and union cataloguing. in the 1970s the
    library founded a special institute to cope with inter-library
    loans and union cataloguing. the institute's work has included
    accelerating ordering procedures, organising copyright deposit
    and international inter-loan schemes, improving staff
    qualifications, solving legal problems connected with the use
    of electronic data processing, keeping catalogues up to date
    and developing a courier service. since 1978 statistics have
    been compiled on the 400 libraries involved in teletext
    services. current projects include computerisation of the
    central union catalogue and of the index of foreign periodicals
    and serials. the institute plays an active part in
    inter-library cooperation between the communist
    countries.
