generalized magneto hydrodynamic formulae the formulae of
    magneto hydro dynamic theory are extended by the simpler
    methods of magneto ionic theory in which mean velocities and
    forces are used and nonlinearities are avoided by perturbation
    treatment the results are applied to the case of plane wave
    propagation in the direction of a primary magnetic field
