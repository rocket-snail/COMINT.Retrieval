the professional status of librarianship. the advent of
    data processing and information science has improved the
    standing of librarianship as a profession and at the same time
    created a demand for better qualifications, especially graduate
    entry. library associations have an important role to play in
    putting pressure on local and central government to improve the
    status of their members. this status varies considerably from 1
    country to another, although the general trend is upwards, and
    from 1 kind of library to another. in some universities,
    librarians enjoy full academic status, but a librarian must be
    more than a pure academic and must be proficient in the
    practical administrative skills as well.
