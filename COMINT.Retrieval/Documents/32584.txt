observation of atmospherics at very low frequencies
    results of observations at munich and several other places at
    frequencies in the range are correlated with meteorological
    phenomena two main types of waveform were distinguished one
    comprising wave trains of duration at a frequency about the
    other of a generally nonsinusoidal character at frequencies
    between and the former is associated with the presence of a
    temperature inversion the latter with low nimbus clouds the
    latter type occurred most frequently one to two days prior to
    the onset of increased temperatures neither type of atmospheric
    could be observed following the onset of fohn type
