impulsive radio signals from the planet venus report of
    reception at the ohio state university of radiation at a
    wavelength of the observations were made using an
    interferometer array of horizontal elements with reflectors the
    peak power in a burst is estimated to be about per of bandwidth
    this is about of the value estimated for a burst from jupiter
    on the basis of power considerations the mechanism involved
    could be o lightning discharge type a record obtained on is
    reproduced and discussed
