buchanan, locke and wittgenstein on classification.
    buchanan's account of classification (2theory of library
    classification, 1bingley, 1969) claims that (1) class members
    necessarily share something in common and (2) classification is
    a mental activity. traces both claims to locke and maintains
    that they are contentious. discusses wittgenstein's alternative
    theory.
