atmospheric scale height as a modifying influence on
    linear trend of region electron density with sunspot number
    twelve month running average values of noon maximum electron
    density and true height of the layer at christchurch are
    plotted against twelve month running average sunspot numbers
    for the period a departure from linearity is apparent above a
    sunspot number of it is suggested that increases in scale
    height near the sunspot maximum were large enough to modify the
    increase in the rate of ion production with a consequent
    relative decrease in maximum electron density
