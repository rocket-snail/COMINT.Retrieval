interpretation of measurements on the ionosphere f layer
    the maximum ionization level of the f layer is often located
    within the lower part of the f layer so that echo sounding
    yields a continuous curve for the f and f layers with a more or
    less marked maximum or merely a point of inflection indicating
    the virtual height of the f layer is not clearly defined a
    correction is required the sign of which depends on th the
    theory accepted for the origin of the f layer mohlers theory of
    gives results in good agreement with observations
