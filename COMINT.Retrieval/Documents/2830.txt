pseudoresonant and phase shifting quadripoles as
    frequency determining elements in rc oscillators rc oscillators
    with a sinusoidal output are divided into two main groups
    according to the type of rc network they include equivalent
    circuits are obtained and simple expressions are derived for
    the frequency of stable oscillation and for the condition for
    self excitation
