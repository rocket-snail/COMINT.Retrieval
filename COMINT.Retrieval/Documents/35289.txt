ionized gas and high energy electrons in the vicinity of
    the earth and in the interplanetary space examination of
    results obtained by the three soviet cosmic rockets relating to
    the van allen belts the variation of ion concentration with
    distance from the earth and the dependence of the trap
    collector current and the potential of the container on the
    electron current at given ion concentrations are shown
    graphically
