soft typography. improvements in digital video typography
    are seen as a necessary component of increased interactivity
    and scope of use of soft copy text display systems. a
    grayscaling scheme produces high-quality fonts for display with
    standard colour video equipment, reducing scintillation,
    smoothing curves, and improving encodability. the same concept
    allows a 'virtual resolution' far beyond the spatial resolution
    of normal pixel size, permitting up to 80 characters per line
    of readable text on colour televisions.
