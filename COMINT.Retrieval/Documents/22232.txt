synthesis of terminal pair networks to realize a
    quadripole ladder network comprising only reactive elements and
    with prescribed transfer function five general conditions must
    be satisfied these are discussed with particular reference to
    the synthesis of a ladder network consisting of a number of l
    sections in cascade all the sections except one comprising only
    inductors and capacitors a simple method of completely
    determining the transfer function of such a network is
    outlined
