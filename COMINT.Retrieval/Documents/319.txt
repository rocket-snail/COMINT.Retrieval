bandpass amplifiers a design method is presented based on
    the required overall gain half power bandwidth and centre
    frequency of the pass band the amplifier considered is composed
    of a number of identical groups each comprising one or more
    amplifying stages and having a maximum flatness frequency
    response conditions for maximum possible gain are found
    regeneration due to anode grid capacitances is discussed the
    amount of distortion introduced into the frequency response is
    related to a regeneration coefficient when is sufficiently
    large oscillations occur stability conditions for single tuned
    and stagger tuned and stagger tuned amplifiers are
    derived
