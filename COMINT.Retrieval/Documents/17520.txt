the factfinder information retrieval system. factfinder
    is a minicomputer-based information handling package developed
    on the basis of total information management. within the system
    the concepts of text processing and word processing are united
    to provide effective management of information at every stage.
    thus, factfinder combines flexible data input facilities with a
    powerful retrieval capability, enhanced by the inclusion of
    efficient editing and reporting functions. factfinder is
    specifically designed for interactive use in a multi-user
    environment. input is user-defined and may be free text or
    formatted. editing and retrieval are also on-line procedures
    and due to factfinder's efficient background processing
    facility, the updating and printing functions may run
    simultaneously with these on-line terminal activities. any
    batch routines are also initiated at the terminals although
    these are few and of a utility or security nature. factfinder
    is based on the swedish imdoc system and is m arketed by mcs
    mini-computer systems ltd. the software is written in extensive
    basic and the system is available as a complete package of
    software and hardware based on the data general range of
    minicomputers. both software and hardware are fully supported
    by mini-computer systems ltd.
