library services in nordkalotten) special section on
    norwegian, swedish, and finnish library services to the samis;
    these are inhabitants of nordkalotten, that part of scandinavia
    within the arctic circle. after years of neglect, efforts are
    being made to preserve the sami language and culture, a few
    sami language books have been published, and the children are
    being taught the language in school. although many are now
    resident farmers and fishermen, some sami are still nomadic.
    library services face great difficulties because of the
    scattered population and vast distances. for abstracts of the
