a new type of high voltage machine a machine is described
    which operates on a principle related to that of the van de
    graaff generator with the difference that the moving belts
    carry not surface charges but capacitors which become charged
    on reaching a certain point and are then connected in series
    performance figures are given for an experimental model in
    which the capacitors are stationary and the electrical contacts
    are rotated
