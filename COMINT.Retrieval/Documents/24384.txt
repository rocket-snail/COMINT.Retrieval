the diffraction of waves by an irregular refracting
    medium a method is described of calculating the diffraction
    effects produced by a thick stratum of an irregular refracting
    medium it consists of evaluating the statistics of the phase
    irregularities in the wave front after traversing the medium
    and treating these irregularities s having been produced by a
    thin phase changing screen for a particular statistical model
    of the irregularities in the medium the result is shown to be
    identical with that obtained using a different method
