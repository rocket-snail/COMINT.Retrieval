the cockcroft walton voltage multiplying circuit the
    original circuit is studied by considering it as a transmission
    line losses are examined and formulae are developed for the
    voltage efficiency for a given size of capacitor and number of
    stages two modifications to improve voltage efficiency are
    discussed the first is the use of a loading coil at the hv end
    of the line the other is the inclusion of inductors in series
    with each of the capacitors
