the cherenkov effect in composite isotropic media a
    theoretical investigation based on the invariance of maxwells
    equations the case of two coaxial dielectrics and permeable
    cylinders with a common cylindrical interface and a charged
    particle moving along their common axis is considered results
    are discussed with particular reference to cherenkov radiation
    at radio and microwave frequencies the effect of coherence on
    the output of the emitted radiation is outlined
