simultaneous partial absorption reflection and
    transmission of a nonuniform plane wave by a thin metal film
    the theory developed for uniform waves of is extended to
    nonuniform waves such as those propagated in waveguides
    appropriately modified expressions for th energy components are
    obtained by taking account of the guided wave phase velocity
    conditions with a set of parallel films are discussed a film of
    thickness such as to absorb of the incident energy can be made
    totally absorbing by setting up standing waves at the back
    surface
