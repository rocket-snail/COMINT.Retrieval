transfer matrix of a four terminal passive network in
    terms of its image parameters the constants in the fundamental
    simultaneous equations relating the input and output voltages
    and currents for a linear passive quadripole have a particular
    significance and can be used to derive the transfer matrix of
    any passive network in terms of the image impedances this is
    demonstrated for the l type of network
