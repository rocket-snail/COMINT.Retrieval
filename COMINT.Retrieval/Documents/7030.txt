current directions in research work with newspaper
    collections. use of the newspaper department of the lenin state
    library has more than doubled over the last 3 years. in such an
    expanding field of librarianship there is much work to be done
    establishing a theoretical basis for the organisation and use
    of newspapers. particular directions for research can be
    readily identified. in 1978 the lenin state library organised a
    conference on the subject as the 1st step in a long-term
    programme to set up a methodological guidance centre for work
    with newspaper collections.
