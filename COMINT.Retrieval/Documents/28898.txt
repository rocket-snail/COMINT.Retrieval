high frequency amplification using transistors
    measurements were made on transistors type oc and oc in the
    grounded base connection to assess them for use in narrow band
    if amplifiers the voltage feedback effect may lead to
    instability hence neutralization is essential at the higher
    frequencies the stage gain is reduced mainly by the base
    resistance and the collector barrier capacitance
