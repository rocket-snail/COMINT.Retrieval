ferroelectric memory in the parametron circuits
    difficulties experienced in the use of ferroelectric materials
    in pulse type storage systems are shown to be partly overcome
    in parametron circuits the present limitation is due to
    unsuitable ferroelectric materials batio shows a high fatigue
    phenomenon and triglycine sulphate a low switching
    velocity
