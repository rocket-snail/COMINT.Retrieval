american education libraries and the academic
    study/training debate. as late as 1899, no more than 1/3 of the
    teachers in massachusetts had been exposed to library
    facilities in a normal school. during the early 20th century, a
    change took place which affected teacher education as much as
    it did other disciplines. education library collections
    developed, education library services expanded to meet a
    growing demand. education librarians began to hold national
    meetings and to debate questions of standards, both
    quantitative and qualitative. throughout its brief history,
    education librarianship seems to have been caught between the
    push for the academic study of education and the pull for the
    practical training of teachers.
