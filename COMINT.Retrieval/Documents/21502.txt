joint and individual authorship in information science
    (interim study). using his previous studies of joint and
    individual authorship in natural sciences, the author carried
    out a similar survey for information science. 17 volumes of the
    russian journal nauch.-tekh. inf. (1963-79) have been used in
    the survey. the conclusions endorsed the author's hypothesis
    that decline in the level of individual authorship stops at the
    50% mark of all published articles, and, secondly, that from
    all the forms of joint authorship, the cooperation of 2 authors
    is the most common one. the trends are illustrated in graphical
    form.
