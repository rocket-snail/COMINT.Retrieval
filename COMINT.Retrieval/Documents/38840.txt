sources for the history of climate. work presented in
    1979 at a course on archives in the university of montreal
    history department. the 1st section details the possible data
    sources' meteorological readings; tree dating; harvest records;
    empirical qualitative climate observations; and glacier
    studies. the 2nd section discusses the difficulties involved in
    gathering adequate scientific materials in each case, and
    concludes by emphasising that the history of climate is
    necessarily an inter-disciplinary and comparative field where
    the role of the archivist is fundamental.
