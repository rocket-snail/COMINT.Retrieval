fiche or film for com catalogues-two use tests. the
    school of library and information studies, university of
    california at berkeley, carried out 2 studies in 1979 in which
    individuals undertook a series of 'catalogue look-up' quizzes,
    answering similar sets of questions through the use of film and
    fiche versions of the same catalogue. the 1st test employed
    average library users-students and their non-student
    acquaintances. the 2nd test focussed on campus library staff.
    the results suggest that there is very little difference in the
    ease or difficulty of use of microfilm and microfiche and that
    the decision on which to install should be based on grounds
    other than ease of use.
