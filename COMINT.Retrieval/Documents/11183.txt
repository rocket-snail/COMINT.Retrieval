electrical wave filter with prescribed operating
    characteristics calculations are simplified by the application
    of image parameter theory to filter design which may outweigh
    the advantages of economy in circuit components resulting from
    the use of insertion loss methods exact relations are derived
    between the quadripole and insertion loss characteristics of
    reactance quadripoles and examples are given
