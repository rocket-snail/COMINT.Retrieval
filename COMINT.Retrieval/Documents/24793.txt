roughness of the moon as a radar reflector measurements
    have been made at a wavelength of ten cm and pulse duration of
    five of the angular scattering properties of the moons surface
    from the results a law of scattering has been obtained which is
    consistens with scattering from a rough surface which has
    irregularities much greater than a wavelength and a horizontal
    scale equivalent to about twenty times the vertical
    deviations
