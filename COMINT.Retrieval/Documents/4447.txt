ntl's computerisation work at oslo university library.
    members of norsk tjenestemannlag (the norwegian association of
    public servants) employed in oslo university library set up
    their own group in 1977-78, and established a working party to
    define their professional policy on computerisation. topics
    have included discussion on recent official statements on the
    framework of data systems; distribution of information to shop
    stewards and employees; training courses; liaison officers;
    contact meetings; cooperation among professional organisations
    in oslo university library; statements on concrete projects;
    demands regarding computerisation development; representation
    on relevant bodies; working conditions and hours at terminals;
    need for specific statements on local data systems;
    administration of national systems; and contact with colleagues
    in other libraries. in oslo university library programmes of
    computer use are at a comparatively advanced stage of
    development, so far without major cons equences for individual
    staff. the working party's efforts have produced guidelines on
    certain problems, and contributed to the cooperative body of
    work on computerisation by professional librarians.
