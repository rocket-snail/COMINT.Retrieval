non-administrative users of archives in france. report of
    a study carried out in 1980 by the association of french
    archivists. its 2 main sections comprise a general report on
    the state and activities of the association as a whole, and 5
    special reports from each of the association sections, dealing
    with the national archives, the archives of central government
    agencies, regional archives, municipal archives, and business
    archives. all 6 reports are presented in a standard format,
    covering user characteristics, research activities, and archive
    services. the overall picture shows an explosive increase in
    the use of archive search rooms since 1956, caused by
    increasing numbers of 'occasional' users, while the number of
    academic researchers has decreased.
