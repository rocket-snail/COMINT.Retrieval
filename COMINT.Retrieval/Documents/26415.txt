readership surveys and local library co-operation.
    presents the results of a survey of literature and discussions
    with researchers and librarians on readership surveys and
    library cooperation in the uk and discusses the feasibility of
    conducting a study into academic library use and cooperation in
    scotland. concludes that there can be little justification in
    such a survey, but that a smaller project on how the
    information needs of academics are satisfied in their own
    institution's library would be useful. suggests a methodology
    for the project.
