on the physical realizability of linear nonreciprocal
    networks the necessary and sufficient conditions are given that
    a matrix with arbitrary complex number elements be the
    impedance admittance or scattering matrix of a physical linear
    reciprocal network a canonical form for non reciprocal network
    synthesis is presented which applies to any linear n terminal
    pair n port system at any fixed frequency if the network i is
    passive the only circuit element required in addition to
    lossless inductors capacitors transformers and positive
    resistors is the gyrator if the network is active negative
    resistors and gyrators must be used in addition to conventional
    passive elements some discussion of matrixes with frequency
    variable elements is also given
