a mains supplied indicating dc amplifier with linear
    response a stage unit for use in conjunction with a
    piezoelectric transducer and a duddell oscillograph for
    obtaining indicator diagrams is described an electrometer valve
    is used as input to a first preamplifier stage from which cable
    connection is made to the remaining amplifier stages and the
    oscillograph amplifier stability is good and effects of valve
    aging not apparent
