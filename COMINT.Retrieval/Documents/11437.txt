minimizing contact potential in apparatus design
    consideration is given particularly to the design of radio
    equipment required to function under adverse conditions such as
    exposure to humid or salt laden atmosphere a table reproduced
    from the inter services document rcs gives the potentials of
    various metals in sea water against the saturated calomel
    electrode as a guide to the choice of metal coatings the latter
    may be applied by electroplating spraying or hot
    dippling
