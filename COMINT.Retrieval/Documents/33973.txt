the charge density near a sharp point on a conductor the
    idea that surface charge tends to infinity at convex sharp
    points on conductors and to zero at convace points is
    investigated on electrostatic principles it is found that the
    problem has not been solved a new attempt is made using
    potential theory methods from which a fairly general solution
    is obtained
