which route for electronic mail?. electronic mail is
    likely to become a major business application over the next few
    years, but the form it will take is less clear. systems based
    around facsimile or communicating word processors could be
    popular because while transmitting letters and other documents
    electronically, they require few changes to existing office
    procedures. computer-based message systems require changes in
    user habits, but also offer additional benefits, e.g. improved
    managerial effectiveness and a reduction in the time spent on
    clerical tasks.
