use of the library reserve collection at depauw
    university. undertaken to determine if the pattern of use of
    library reserve collections found at other college libraries
    continues to exist at depauw, this study found that
    approximately 40% of all the reserve collection items never
    circulated during the entire semester, and that 33% of the
    collection circulated only 1-5 times during that period. it is
    suggested that librarians examine their reserve collections to
    reduce the amount of time and effort expended on them, and to
    prevent them from discouraging more extensive use of the
    library. statistical tables and references are provided. report
