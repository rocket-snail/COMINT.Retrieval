the germanium junction rectifier the junction is produced
    by alloying a controlled quantity of with a crystal about
    square and thick with resistivity about the manufacture
    electrical characteristics and methods of assessing the
    performance of the rectifier are described applications are
    grouped into use with resistive load use with battery load and
    pulse and miscellaneous by virtue of its high efficiency this
    rectifier can be used for high powers with comparatively simple
    cooling systems
