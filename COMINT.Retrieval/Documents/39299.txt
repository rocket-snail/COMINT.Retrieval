a procedure for tuning a bridge stabilized crystal
    oscillator a meacham bridge circuit is used in which the lamp
    is replaced by a thermistor and a second thermistor is added to
    compensate for ambient temperature fluctuations a sensitive
    method of tuning input and output transformers in this circuit
    is described
