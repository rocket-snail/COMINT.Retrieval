horizontal drifts and temperature in the lower part of
    region e drift velocities deduced from the fading of cw signals
    at oblique incidence are related to results obtained using
    other techniques a minimum velocity at km is indicated and a
    possible connection with a temperature minimum at the same
    height is discussed
