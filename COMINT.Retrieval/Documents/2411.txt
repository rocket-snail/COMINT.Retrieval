on the occurrence of spread echoes in the region over
    japan analysis of published ionospheric data for japan for the
    period suggests that spread echoes occur more frequently in the
    north than in the south chiefly at night at the solstices and
    when solar activity is weak echoes of the most common type are
    attributed to reflections from irregularities in the upper
    regions of the layer which are normally masked in daytime
    others may be due to reflections from turbulences during
    magnetic storms of to ionized clouds passing through the normal
    layer
