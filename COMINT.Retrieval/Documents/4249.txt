automation of test-data transmission from producer to
    computer master file. describes 2 methods for the direct input
    of data obtained during scientific experiments into a computer
    terminal, all further data manipulation and processing being
    controlled by computer programs' (1) direct recording of
    observations (e.g. plant growth) on a portable battery-powered
    recording device, followed by data transmission to the computer
    and (2) crt entry of observed values for test and control
    animals for specific tests. only after verification of data
    accuracy by the information producer are the results entered
    into the master data base. in the experiments described, the
    abbott automated biological and chemical data system (abcd) was
    used.
