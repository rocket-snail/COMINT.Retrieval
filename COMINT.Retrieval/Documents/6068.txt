the distribution of temperature along a thin rod
    electrically heated in vacuo part end losses the correction for
    end losses is calculated for some typical physical properties
    which are functions of powers of temperature t or both as in
    thermionic emission the calculated corrections for a long w
    filament agree closely with those computed graphically by
    worthing the corrections for medium length filaments such as
    used in hf power valves are practically the same as those for a
    long filament heated by the same current
