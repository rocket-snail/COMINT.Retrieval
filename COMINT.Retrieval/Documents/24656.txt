service to older adult users of academic libraries' a
    study of librarian attitudes. (phd thesis-university of
    pittsburgh.) a questionnaire was sent to 311 librarians at us
    colleges and universities sponsoring elderhostel (a programme
    for adults aged over 60, offered on many campuses) for at least
    2 years during 1977-79. the 197 replies containing usable data
    indicated that the librarians disagreed with stereotypic
    statements concerning older adults; contact with older adult
    relatives was not a significant factor in the librarians'
    responses to the statements; implementing library programmes
    for older adults was a significant factor in librarians'
    agreement with suggested library services for older adults,
    while planning programmes for them was less significant and
    volunteer community work was not a significant factor; and
    librarians felt that age is not necessarily a debilitative
    factor with regard to learning and motivation to learn.
