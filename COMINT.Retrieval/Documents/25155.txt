field aligned ionospheric irregularities and the
    scintillation of satellite radio transmissions observations of
    radio transmissions from made at brisbane during july september
    have been analysed results indicate that the scintillation
    activity associated with propagation along the lines of the
    earths magnetic field is more pronounced than that associated
    with other directions of propagation the results are in
    agreement with those of rush and colin
