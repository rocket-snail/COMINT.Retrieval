automatic frequency control of high power klystrons a
    method of control is described in which a cavity resonator and
    two microwave crystals are used as a standing wave
    discriminator in a system for automatic frequency search and
    lock for a pulsed klystron oscillator frequency stability to
    within part in is achieved
