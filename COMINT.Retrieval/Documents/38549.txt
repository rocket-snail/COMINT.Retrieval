reflection of microwaves from metal plate media
    experiments were made using frequencies in the cm band to
    verify the theory worked out by lengyel of waveguide assemblies
    of various depths were used with the reflecting surfaces normal
    to the plates for single surface measurements the absorbing
    wedges described by ruze and young of were used phase and
    amplitude of the reflection coefficient were determined for
    angles of incidence and for various ratios between plate
    separation and wavelength double surface slab measurements were
    also made using assemblies of parallel plates instead of square
    waveguides
