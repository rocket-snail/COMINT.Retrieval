statistical analysis of radio star scintillation radio
    star scintillation data are analysed by statistical techniques
    t find the auto correlation functions and power density spectra
    of the fluctuations in amplitude and phase interpretation is
    given in terms of a drifting phase changing screen as
    postulated by booker ratcliffe shinn of it is shown how the
    drift velocity of the irregularities in ionospheric electron
    density that lead to the scintillations as well as the mean
    square amplitude and phase of the fluctuations may be obtained
    from these records
