the fading of radio waves reflected vertically from the
    ionosphere during magnetic storms correlation analysis is
    applied to the spread rapidly fading reflection observed at
    cambridge during magnetic storms the drift velocity is usually
    large and towards the west and the direction of elongation of
    the diffraction pattern shows that the ionospheric
    irregularities are aligned with the earths magnetic
    field
