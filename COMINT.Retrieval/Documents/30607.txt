old and new methods for designing composite high
    frequency filter circuits and their application to filter
    circuits with low relative bandwidth a calculation based on
    that given by edelmann for tchebycheff type filters is used to
    extend schienemanns formulae for multistage filters of to the
    case of finite ripples of the response curve for low relative
    bandwidths simple formulae are derived for the form factors and
    time constants of the double circuit stages as the ripples tend
    to zero further simplifications can be introduced modification
    of the method is indicated to deal with cases where large
    ripples are permitted for the sake of selectivity
