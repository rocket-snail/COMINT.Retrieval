    training seminar on art centres in berlin. report on a seminar
    organised by the german library institute and the new berlin

    systematic exchanges of experience from centres lending works
    of art to the public. in germany there are now 40 of these
    centres, most of them closely linked with the public library;
    this figure puts germany in 3rd place internationally, behind
    sweden and holland. 3 art centres in berlin are described'- the
    art workshop and gallery of the artist siegfried kuhl at
    heiligensee; the art workshop at bethanien; the berlin art
    centre. discussions were held on picture restoration, the
    effect of economic problems on art centre development and the
    need to interest more people in modern art.
