right brother trees insertion and deletion are provided
    for the class of right (or one-sided) brother trees which have
    o (log n) performance. the importance of these results stems
    from the close relationship of right brother trees which have
    an insertion algorithm operating in o (log2 n). further,
    although both insertion and deletion can be carried out in o
    (log n) time for right brother trees, it appears that the
    insertion algorithm is inherently much more difficult than the
    deletion algorithm-the reverse of what one usually obtains.
