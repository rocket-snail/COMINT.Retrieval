current problems in work with rare editions. the problems
    of acquiring and recording rare editions, leaving aside
    preservation and reader services, are multitudinous. there is
    no accepted definition of what constitutes a rare book' its age
    can be easily defined, but not so the significance of its
    content or publication. central and regional libraries apply
    different criteria and methods of collection are haphazard.
    following a recent statement by the council of ministers on
    preserving cultural treasures, libraries should register local
    private collections of rare books and take steps to prevent
    them being dissipated, create union catalogues of their
    holdings, and a list of the nation's most important collections
    should be compiled and published.
