review of nonlinear distortion in transistor stages
    including cross modulation the nonlinear transfer function is
    approximated by a taylor series expansion and from this
    equations are derived for various types of distortion in
    earthed emitter transistor circuits methods of compensating
    cross modulation are considered the results of cross modulation
    measurements are found to be similar to those obtained by akgun
    and strutt of
