an estimate of the density and motion of solar material
    from observed characteristics of solar radio outbursts theory
    previously given by feinstein and sen of is extended and
    applied to the observations made in australia by wild and
    mccready of and by wild and of the spectra o solar rf outbursts
    in the range of the dispersion equation equation involving the
    velocity of solar material erupting into a static corona and
    the temperature and densities of the material and of the corona
    enables the velocity of the material to be estimated as about
    with a particle density of about with a particle density of
    about
