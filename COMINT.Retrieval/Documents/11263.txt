numerical ray tracing in electron lenses corrections are
    suggested to liebmanns formulae for tracing paraxial rays a
    more accurate method is developed applicable also to marginal
    rays and is compared with methods suggested by other workers
    the use of the constancy of the wronskian determinant as a
    criterion of accuracy of paraxial ray tracing is
    discussed
