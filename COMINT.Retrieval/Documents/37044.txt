the impedance of chokes resistors and capacitors at high
    frequency analysis indicates that in order to represent the
    impedance variation of cylindrical inductors resistors and
    capacitors at frequencies above the first resonance point
    equivalent circuits are needed combining a ladder network with
    simple parallel or series networks nonuniform field
    distribution along the component can then be taken into account
    the validity of the theory is confirmed by reference to
    measurement results shown graphically the effect of an earthing
    lead on a lead through capacitor is demonstrated
