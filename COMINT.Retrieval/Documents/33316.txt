energy exchange between electron and ion gases through
    coulomb collisions in plasmas the general aspects of energy
    exchange between the electron ion and molecular constituent
    gases and their energy transfer to the boundary have been
    examined experimentally for a partially ionized gas coulomb
    collisions between electrons and ions are shown to contribute
    significantly to thermal energy transfer from the electron gas
    even in weakly ionized gases in a plasma produced in ne gas at
    hg at the characteristic time for equipartition of excess mean
    electron energy with the ion gas varies from to as the ion
    concentration increases from to cm
