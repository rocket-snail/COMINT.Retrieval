    between different forms of information' facts; and information
    about information, such as particular books or subjects. to
    handle the stream of information, libraries need new
    technology. only if information is electronically registered

    is needed. the holdings of danish libraries should be
    electronically registered as soon as possible to make them
    available on-line to groups within politics, business, and

    shows that public libraries can handle this task. the new
    information technology could be the point of cooperation
    between all libraries.
