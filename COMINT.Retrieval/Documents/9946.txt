linking bibliographic data bases: a discussion of the
    battelle technical report. in 1979 the council on library
    resources, inc., awarded a contract to battelle-columbus
    laboratories to study the economic and service impacts of
    linking the bibliographic data bases maintained by the us
    bibliographic organisations. 3 link alternatives for 3 possible
    services were evaluated' shared cataloguing of current
    monographs, interlibrary loan, and reference searching. the
    links were to be between library of congress (lc), ohio college
    library center (oclc), washington library network (wln) and
    research libraries information network (rlin). the links
    examined were direct tape delivery, on-line 'native' mode via
    dedicated line and on-line 'translation' mode via dedicated
    line. results of the study are discussed and the next steps for
    network planners are suggested.
