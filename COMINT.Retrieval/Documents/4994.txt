ferrite phase shifters in rectangular wave guide
    propagation theory is developed for a nonreciprocal device with
    asymmetrical arrangement as described by losses in the ferrite
    being neglected the dependence of the phase shift on the
    thickness of the ferrite slab on the degree of asymmetry and on
    the intensity of the transverse magnetic field is investigated
    the field configuration in the guide is shown diagrammatically
    for some special cases a modification with two symmetrically
    arranged ferrite slabs and antiparallel magnetic fields is also
    discussed
