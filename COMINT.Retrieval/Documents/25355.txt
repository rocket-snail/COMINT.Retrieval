meteor radiant determination from high echo rate
    observations a simplified analysis is given of the clegg method
    for delineating meteor radiants from radar observations see of
    a further analysis reveals a new and faster method of
    interpreting the data contained in meteor echo records this
    method is applicable when sensitive equipment is employed and
    the resulting echo rate is very high
