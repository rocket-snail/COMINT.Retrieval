non maxwellian theory of homogeneous anisotropic plasmas
    using theory based on boltzmanns integegro differential
    equation a calculation is made of the distribution of electron
    velocities in an ionized gas subjected to a constant magnetic
    field for non maxwellian conditions explicit expressions are
    derived for the magneto ionic conductivity dielectric tensor
    hall effect deflection of an electron beam and a generalized
    form of langevins mobility formula results are compared with
    those obtained by other methods based on mean free path wave
    propagation is studied formulae being derived for refractive
    index birefringence phase and group velocities attenuation
    polarization and critical frequencies classical results of
    ionosphere theory are confirmed see also of
