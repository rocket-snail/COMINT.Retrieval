sputtering as a possible mechanism for increase of
    ionization in the vicinity of low altitude satellites an
    increase in ionization above ambient may occur at distances of
    up to mean path from the satellite ionization potentials of the
    injected atoms ar to those of the ambient species the
    probability of any collision leading to ionization should
    exceed with the model proposed for the mechanism to be of
    interest
