penetration of electrons and ions in aluminium the depth
    of penetration of to electrons and ions in aluminium has been
    measured it has been found that the thompson whiddington law
    for electrons does not hold for electrons having energies less
    than the practical range energy relation obtained for electrons
    in aluminium was found to be where is if is expressed in and in
    microns the practical range energy relation for light ions in
    aluminium was found to be where results are compared with those
    obtained by previous observers
