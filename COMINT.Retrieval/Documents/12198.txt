classes of four pole networks having nonlinear transfer
    characteristics but linear iterative impedances a graphical
    representation is introduced which simplifies the analysis of
    networks containing nonlinear elements the properties of dual
    nonlinear resistances in which the relation for one resistance
    is the same as the relation for the other are considered such
    duals if realizable would permit the design of nonlinear four
    poles having linear iterative impedances which could be
    cascaded
