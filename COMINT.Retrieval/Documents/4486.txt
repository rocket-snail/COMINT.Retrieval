construction and calibration of an inductive attenuator a
    hf attenuator is described which makes use of the properties of
    a waveguide at d frequencies far below cut off for a frequency
    of the attenuation varies linearly to within between and db
    with the distance between the source and the output coil the
    attenuation can be calculated from the physical dimensions
