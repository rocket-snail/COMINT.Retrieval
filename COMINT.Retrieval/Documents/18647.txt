    fluctuations part using the eight daily k numbers three hour
    range indices for six observatories in moderately low latitudes
    and fairly well distributed in longitude a universal time
    component of the daily variation of irregular geomagnetic
    fluctuations having an apparently significant amplitude in the
    yearly average has been found in the data for the nine years it
    is suggested that a portion of magnetic disturbance may be
    produced by dynamo action in the ionosphere and give rise to
    this yearly average universal time component for part see
