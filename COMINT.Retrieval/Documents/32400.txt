nature of corpuscular radiation of the upper atmosphere
    the concentration of particles in the solar corpuscular stream
    is sufficient to renew the corpuscles of the outer radiation
    belt over a period of only a few hours an estimation is made of
    the energy spectrum of protons and the velocity of generation
    of hard corpuscles in the inner belt
