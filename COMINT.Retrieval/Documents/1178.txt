fluctuations in oscillator with inertial nonlinearity
    fluctuations in a valve oscillator the steady state amplitude
    in which is determined by an inertial nonlinearity such as a
    feed back system are considered theoretically and some
    practical conclusions are reached on the choice of circuit
    parameters for minimum amplitude fluctuations
