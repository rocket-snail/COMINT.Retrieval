solar radio asymmetry at metres wavelength the greater
    frequency of observation of solar bursts at in association with
    flares on the eastern half of the suns disk of may be due to
    absorption of bursts from the western half in ionized streams
    this would account for the lack of evidence of asymmetry at for
    which wavelength absorption is much less an analysis of this
    asymmetry with reference to geomagnetic activity is being
    made
