thickness shear and flexural vibrations of a circular
    disk antisymmetrical modes of vibration in a quartz disk are
    investigated by considering the simpler corresponding case of
    an isotropic disk differences between the frequency spectrum in
    this case and in that of the rectangular plate are due to the
    presence of thickness twist modes in addition to the thickness
    shear and flexural modes
