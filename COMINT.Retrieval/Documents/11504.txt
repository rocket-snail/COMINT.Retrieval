effects of harmonics on the frequency of oscillation as
    well as on the asymmetry of the resonance curves the nonlinear
    equations representing the free and synchronized oscillations
    are transformed into linear equations with periodically varying
    coefficients and complete solutions are obtained the relation
    between frequency variation and harmonic content is derived
    experimental results supporting the theory are reported
