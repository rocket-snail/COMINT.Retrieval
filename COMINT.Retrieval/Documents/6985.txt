a simple microwave discriminator a cylindrical resonator
    with slightly disturbed symmetry has two closely spaced
    resonance frequencies for the mode corresponding to two waves
    with slightly different propagation velocities these can be
    detected separately by means of rectifiers a discriminator
    characteristic s given by the difference of the rectified
    currents as a function of frequency the dimensions of the
    resonator for a given frequency can be reduced by capacitive
    loading discriminators of this type are suitable for
    measurement and control purposes rather than for
    demodulation
