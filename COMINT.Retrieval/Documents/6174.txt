characteristics of radio echoes from meteor trails
    polarization effects the theoretical estimates of plasma
    resonance effects by were tested at a frequency of the
    polarization effects observed are in good agreement with the
    predictions for both short and long duration echoes but some
    unexpected results were obtained for meteor trails with line
    densities in the transition region of electrons the echo
    amplitude was found to be proportional to instead of the
    predicted where is the duration of the echo the discrepancy may
    be the result of diffusion by turbulence in the
    atmosphere
