arctic measurements of electron collision frequencies in
    the d region of the ionosphere simultaneous measurement of
    refractive indices and the difference in the absorption of the
    two magneto ionic components of a signal transmitted from a
    rocket allowed the electron collision frequency profile to be
    determined the results of two midday flights indicate that the
    frequencies are lower by a factor of three than the unpublished
    theoretical values calculated by nicolet
