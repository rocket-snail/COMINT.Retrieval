a graphical sinusoidal analysis of a nonlinear rc phase
    shift feedback circuit frequency response curves are discussed
    of af oscillator circuits including nonlinear eg thyrite
    resistors in the feedback loop over a part of the frequency
    range the voltage function is triple valued the method used
    involves the graphical superposition of the voltage resistance
    characteristic of the nonlinear resistor on that of the
    parallel circuit
