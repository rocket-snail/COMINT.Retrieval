on the power spectrum of solar radio outburst and its
    relation to swf dellinger phenomenon and geomagnetic storm
    solar radio outbursts are classified according to their power
    spectra those with power spectra increasing towards lower
    frequencies are associated with magnetic storms but not with
    sids while those with spectra increasing towards higher
    frequencies are associated with sids without an accompanying
    magnetic storm outbursts with flat power spectra appear to
    combine the attributes of the other two types
