a voltage modulated variable pulse rate generator a pulse
    generator is described the output frequency of which is a
    linear function of the input voltage the circuit is a screen
    coupled double phantastron pulse circulating system with
    suitable modifications to improve the accuracy of transfer at
    low output frequencies achieving stable discriminator levels
    with a biased input diode
