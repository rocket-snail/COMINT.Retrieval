the principle of the 'free' public library. for various
    reasons it is becoming more and more difficult for public
    libraries to obtain sufficient funds from their authorities, in
    competition with other more essential services. free public
    libraries originated in the uk during the middle of the last
    century, their main function being the uplifting of the
    uneducated. today public libraries mainly concentrate on the
    supplying of light reading matter, especially novels, of which
    the majority are, from a literary point of view, of a dubious
    nature. the arguments used during the last century to defend
    the principle of free services are no longer valid today. the
    functions of the modern public library are neither fully part
    of the world of education nor the world of recreation, with the
    result that its image to the outside world is obscure.
    considers that, although continued financing of public library
    services by the south african government is necessary, no valid
    objection can be found to charg e users for those services
    which are not essential for the aims which the public library
    pursues.
