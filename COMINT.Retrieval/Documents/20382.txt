the vatican library. describes the vatican library.
    despite numerous plunders and dispersals of the collections the
    library has grown under the care of many library cardinals and
    popes. thus on the death of pope nicholas v in 1455 it
    contained europe's largest manuscript collection. the official
    foundation was laid with sixtus iv's bull in 1475, the
    collection was organised in 4 parts, and the 1st catalogue
    appeared in 1485. a liberal lending policy was stopped for all
    time by sixtus v, who also had the present building erected in
    1588. expansion forced the library to occupy rooms other than
    the original sistine saloon. the 20th century has seen
    modernisation of the building and of administrative and library
    techniques. the library contains among many precious
    manuscripts the collection belonging to queen christina of
    sweden. cataloguing of manuscripts, incunabula and printed
    books has been going on since the 15th century.
