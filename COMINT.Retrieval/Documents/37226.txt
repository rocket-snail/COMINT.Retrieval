light waves in crystals in the region of exciton
    absorption and the impurity photoeffect in the frequency range
    for which the refractive index is much less than unity the
    amplitudes of normal and longitudinal waves in a cubic crystal
    greatly exceed the amplitude of the incident wave the
    photoionization of impurities is therefore much more intense
    this explains the sharp maximum in the internal and external
    photoeffects observed experimentally in the frequency range
    corresponding to exciton absorption
