national developments in serials. paper presented at the
    canadian library association's canadian association of college
    and university libraries technical services coordinating group
    workshop, vancouver, b.c., 14 june 80. in the early 1970s 2
    national task groups recommended the establishment of a
    national serials data base in canada. to create a data base
    libraries must share data about serials. standards are a
    pre-requisite to sharing data-a standard definition of a
    serial, the issn, the marc format, standards for holdings
    statements and library symbols and cataloguing standards. use
    of standard sources of data also facilitates sharing. a
    national serials data base now exists in canada on the federal
    government dobis system jointly maintained by the national
    library of canada and the canada institute of scientific and
    technical information. data on holdings of major canadian
    libraries are collected and edited in a central
    location.
