electron emission from cold metal surfaces at medium
    field strengths measurements were made of the field emisson of
    an fe cathode at pressures torr the emission field strength
    characteristic depends largely on the pre treatment of the
    cathode material applying schottkys equation a value of is
    obtained for the work function
