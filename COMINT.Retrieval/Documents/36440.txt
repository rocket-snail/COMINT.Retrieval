harmonic distortion in sinusoidal frequency modulation
    case of an amplifier stage comprising pentode valve and tuned
    transformer formulae are presented for calculating the
    harmonics and the total distortion present in the demodulated
    voltage numerical calculations are performed for five different
    sets of values of two important circuit parameters
