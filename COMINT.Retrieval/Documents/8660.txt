studies on geomagnetic storm in relation to geomagnetic
    pulsation for the recurring geomagnetic storm m type the cone
    of avoidance model of pecker and roberts of is supported by
    both geomagnetic and cosmic ray data for the sporadically
    occurring storm s type a shock front in interplanetary space
    may be responsible for the sudden commencement an exhaustive
    study should be made to determine whether the sudden
    commencement is only associated with the s type the storm time
    variation of the geomagnetic pulsation should also be measured
    during world wide storms to aid the study of the shock
