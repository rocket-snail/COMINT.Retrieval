some applications of permanently magnetized ferrite
    magnetostrictive resonators for frequencies up to about
    magnetostrictive resonators using ferrites are very much
    cheaper than crystal resonators toroidal magnetostrictive
    elements are discussed by applying the biasing and driving
    fields in different directions different modes of vibration are
    obtained a definition is given of the coefficient of coupling
    between driving coil and resonator this coefficient affording
    an indication of the efficiency and being measurable with a q
    meter applications of such devices as frequency control
    elements in oscillator circuits and as components in various
    filter circuits are described
