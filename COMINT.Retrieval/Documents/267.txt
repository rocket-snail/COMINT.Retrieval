a derivation of maxwells equations for a vacuum by means
    of an energy quantum model propagation phenomena such as
    interference and diffraction can be explained by means of
    quantum theory if the energy quanta are assumed to have finite
    volume the magnitude of this volume is estimated from
    consideration of the energy received by a dipole in a field of
    strength
