geomagnetic storm theory the penetration of solar ions
    into the geomagnetic field during the main phase of storms is
    discussed a model is suggested the principal feature of which
    is a magnetic tail extending from the earth on the dark side
    this model would help to explain the gegenschein electrons with
    auroral energies the position of the van allen zones and
    diurnal cosmic ray variations
