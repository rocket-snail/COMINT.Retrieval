influence of magnetic field on convective instability in
    the atmospheres of stars and in the ionosphere of the earth the
    case of a medium with anisotropic electrical and thermal
    conductivities is considered in a plasma which does not contain
    a large number of neutral particles the calculated influence of
    the magnetic field on convection is essentially different from
    that predicted by the magnetohydrodynamic approximation in the
    ionosphere the influence of the magnetic field is small owing
    to the presence of a large number of molecules
