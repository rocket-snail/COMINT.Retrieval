subsystem 'fragment' within the framework of an integral
    information system. a study was carried out in order to
    establish whether fragments, which have an independent meaning
    as far as the information needs of specialists are concerned,
    can be extracted from the text of documents. it is shown that
    it is possible to create a file called 'fragment' and to use
    this file, together with documentary and data files, to produce
    an integrated information system. the 'fragment' file
    represents a new type of information service' in response to
    aspect enquiries, a number of relevant fragments can be located
    without using primary sources. the problems connected with the
    selection and indexing of the fragments are discussed.
