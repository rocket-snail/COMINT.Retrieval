rigorous analysis of the diffraction of electromagnetic
    waves by strip gratings a solution which is valid without
    restriction on wavelength angle of incidence polarization or
    grating constants is obtained in the form of tw fredholm
    integral equations of the first kind of the same structure as
    those derived to represent diffraction by slotted diaphragms in
    rectangular waveguides
