instability of spin waves and magnetostatic modes in a
    microwave magnetic field applied parallel to the dc field two
    methods of calculating the instability threshold are described
    a plane wave analysis strictly applicable only in an infinite
    medium and a more rigorous theory in which the boundary
    conditions at the surface of the sample are taken into
    account
