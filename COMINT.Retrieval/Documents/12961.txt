electronic publishing in information technology year.
    describes the process of electronic publishing of technical
    journals from the author composing at a terminal to the
    finished product being made available in machine-readable form
    and mentions the british library funded birmingham and
    loughborough electronic network development (blend). it is
    unlikely that electronic journals by themselves can be run
    profitably for several years; it is more likely that systems
    will evolve from, and run alongside, existing publications with
    their established reputation and editorial structure. discusses
    the document delivery project adonis being developed by a group
    of international publishers. the full potential of electronic
    publishing will be realised when equipment is developed that
    can handle page make-up in machine readable form.
