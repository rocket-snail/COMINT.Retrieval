on the approximate solution of delta(u)=f(u)
    three-dimensional dirichlet problems for delta(u)=f(u), fu
    >= 0, are treated numerically by an exceptionally fast,
    exceptionally accurate numerical method. programming details,
    numerous examples and mathematical theory are
    supplied.extension of the method in a natural way to
    n-dimensional problems is indicated by means of a 4-dimensional
    example. september, 1963 greenspan, d. yohe, m. ca630931 jb
