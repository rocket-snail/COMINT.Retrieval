comparison of absorption coefficients of the ionosphere
    from pulse amplitude measurements and field strength recordings
    ionospheric absorption was measured by two methods vertical
    incidence soundings at field strength measurements over an
    oblique incidence path in length at mcs threse frequencies are
    such that in both methods the heights of reflection are equal
    the absorption coefficients determined using the two methods
    have a correlation coefficient of for both daily and monthly
    mean values and are related to ez each other by the square of
    the effective frequency
