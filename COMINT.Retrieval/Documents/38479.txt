magnetic effects in a plasma column irradiated with
    microwaves the radius of gyration of a plasma column is
    determined by imparting a coherent circular orbital motion to
    the electrons in the column at its principal resonance
    frequency this is accomplished by irradiating the column with
    two incoming waves of the same frequency but out of phase when
    the electric fields are correctly aligned a magnetic moment is
    developed
