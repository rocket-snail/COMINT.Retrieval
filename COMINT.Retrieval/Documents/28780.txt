cataloguing in the university library' development and
    tendencies. contribution to an issue devoted to the german
    librarians conference at regensburg, 9-13 june 81. for
    alphabetical cataloguing, regensburg university library uses
    the rak rules for academic libraries; further streamlining will
    be carried out here because the bavarian state library will
    shortly join the bavarian new university libraries' interloan
    system. keyword use is standardised; a keyword index published
    every 6 months assists in unifying practice. english keywords
    are used for biology and pre-clinical medicine, german for
    other subjects. regensburg university's own classification
    scheme is used here and in other libraries in the interloan
    scheme. since 1974 printed catalogue volumes have been replaced
    by com-process microfiche, which may in turn be replaced by
    on-line methods when these have become cheaper. access to other
    regional library networks may soon be available through
    electronic data processing.
