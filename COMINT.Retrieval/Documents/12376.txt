computing connected components on parallel computers we
    present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to find
    the connected components of an undirected graph with n vertices
    in time o(log2n). an o(log2n) time bound also can be achieved
    using only n$n/$log2n)) processors. the algorithm can be used
    to find the transitive closure of a symmetric boolean matrix.
    we assume that the processors have access to a common memory.
    simultaneous access to the same location is permitted for fetch
    instructions but not for store instructions. august, 1979
