transient response of the grounded base transistor
    amplifier with small load impedance a transfer function
    relating junction transistor collector current to emitter
    current is derived from the diffusion equation the laplace
    transform technique is used to determine the variation of
    collector current in response to a step variation of emitter
    current collector current rise times evaluated from the theory
    are in good agreement with observed values
