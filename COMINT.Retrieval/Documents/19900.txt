interfering queueing processes in packet-switched
    broadcast communication. considers packet-queueing processes in
    2 interfering buffered packet radio units that share a slotted
    aloha broadcast channel. shows that classical approximation
    schemes fail to provide adequate predictions concerning
    interfering queueing and introduces a new scheme, topological
    approximation, which provides an exact solution of an
    approximate model, obtained by perturbing the topology of
    interference. analysis shows that interference may be cured by
    increasing the interference and that 'maximum interference'
    provides a superb flow-regulating mechanism and the best
    possible delay-throughout performance.
