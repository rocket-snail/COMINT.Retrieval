thickness shear and flexural vibrations of contoured
    crystal plates equations of motion expressing approximately and
    separately the thickness shear and flexural modes are derived
    from data on the coupled modes for a plate of uniform thickness
    of and of mindlin these equations are applied to the case of a
    plate of double wedge shape and a plate with bevelled edges
    results support the finding that thickness shear motion is
    localized at the centre flexural motion at the edges
