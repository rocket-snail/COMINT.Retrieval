solar radio emissions at metres wavelength during
    inclusive and their relations to solar activity bursts at of
    duration min ad of intensity over a certain minimum are
    analysed for correlation with solar flares the medium lag of
    bursts behind associated flares is about a minute but the
    dispersion of the time differences is such that an appreciable
    proportion of the bursts precede the flares secondary
    controlling factors seem to exist both for the solar phenomena
    and the related ionospheric phenomena analysis of the
    distribution of bursts confirms that there is a greater chance
    of bursts in association with flares on the eastern half of the
    suns disk than on the western half
