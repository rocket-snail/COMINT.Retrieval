wave propagation in a partially ionized medium
    theoretical treatment of the propagation and damping of low
    frequency waves in an infinite uniform partially ionized medium
    in a longitudinal magnetic field tso two longitudinal modes one
    an acoustic wave and two transverse uncoupled modes are
    identified
