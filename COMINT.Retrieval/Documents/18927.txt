the variation of decimetre wave radiation with solar
    activity a statistical method is used to segregate the quiet
    component from the slowly varing component of solar decimetre
    wave radiation in the period for this purpose the radiations at
    frequencies and have been correlated with sunspot numbers
    sunspot areas and faculae the mean lives of the various
    radiations and activities have been estimated and compared
    there is an increase of life with decreasing radio frequency
    the life of radiation is about the same as sunspots but
    measurements of the latter show some anomalies the slowly
    varying radiation flux is proportional to frequency in the
    range studied the quiet sun flux has a small but significant
    variation with solar activity the relative change being greater
    for smaller frequencies the possibility that this variation may
    be associated with uncorrelated local sources such as
    prominences is not entirely excluded
