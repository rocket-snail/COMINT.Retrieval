physical principles of avalanche transistor pulse
    circuits a model for the transistor is defined in terms of
    charge variables and the physical parameters of the device the
    transient performance of the model is calculated by focusing
    attention on the minority carrier charge stored in the base
    region and the influence of base width modulation upon this
    stored charge in the charge formulation of the problem the
    physical details of the avalanche multiplication process need
    not be considered multiplication is accounted for by the
    boundary conditions which it imposes upon the stored charge
    good agreement has been obtained between calculated and
    experimentally observed data for a simple avalanche transistor
    relaxation oscillator
