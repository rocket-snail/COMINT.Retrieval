high frequency filter problems in television transmitters
    coaxial line filters for the partial suppression of the lower
    sideband are discussed particular attention is paid to
    arrangements suitable for high level modulation in which the
    filter is spatially separated from the output stage and its
    input impedance is maintained constant over the frequency
    band
