anomalous electron scattering in metals a semi
    theoretical equation was proposed previously to account
    qualitatively for the thermoelectric power of metals and alloys
    particularly at low temperatures the consequences of this
    equation are now examined quantitatively in relation to
    experimental data on alloys of copper
