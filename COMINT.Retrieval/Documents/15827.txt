on parametric excitation with current saturable
    inductances a a parametric amplifier circuit with an abrupt
    nonlinearity is described a method of analysis of relaxation
    oscillations leads to a physical understanding of the cycle of
    oscillations and quantitative relations the stability problem
    is also solved
