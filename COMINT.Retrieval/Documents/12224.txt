backscattering from wide angle and narrow angle cones
    solutions are obtained for the diffraction of the waves
    radiated by scalar and vector point sources on the axis of a
    semi infinite cone the scalar problems are solved by the method
    of characteristic greens functions to yield directly various
    alternative representations whose different convergence
    properties are discussed the vector problem is solved by an
    application of spherical transmission line theory to evaluate
    the plane wave scattering observed far from the cone tip a
    highly convergent contour integral representation is selected
    and evaluated approximately for the special case of
    backscattering from cones having large and small apex angles
    the results for the large angle cone exhibit the transition
    from a backscattered spherical wave to a plane wave as the cone
    degenerates into an infinite plane
