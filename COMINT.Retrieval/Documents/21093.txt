effectiveness of automated interlibrary loan. examines
    the borrowing patterns of 15 academic members of the south
    central research library council (a multi-type library
    consortium in central new york state), the effects of the
    introduction of the oclc/ill subsystem on their interlibrary
    loan patterns, and the transition from the use of nysill (new
    york state interlibrary loan) to use of oclc/ill. finds that
    oclc/ill has had a major impact-material requested is arriving
    significantly faster, the load on major research libraries has
    been reduced, and smaller libraries can now share the load in
    filling interlibrary loan transactions. 25-50% of requested
    monographs are less than 5 years old-perhaps it would be more
    efficient to purchase them. retrospective collection conversion
    would be of value to interlibrary loans if carried out within
    the next 5 years.
