the distribution of radio brightness over the solar disk
    at a wavelength of centimetres part the s owly varying
    component the emitting regions were studied individually using
    a element interferometer producing fringes of arc in width
    during the radio sources were found to lie about above and to
    have the same size as plages faculaires the angular
    distribution of radio flux follows approximately a cosine law
    suggesting that thet the source is a thin shell parallel to the
    suns surface the correlation between radio flux and sunspot
    areas is discussed part
