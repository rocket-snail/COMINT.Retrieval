a backend machine architecture for information retrieval.
    describes progress to date in the development of backend
    machine architecture for large textual data bases or
    information retrieval systems. outlines the use of high-speed
    pattern matching, string processing, and other non-numeric
    operations for the basic search module. the investigators have
    also used a structured approach and functional separation of
    the parts of the backend machine directly related to the
    high-level query language, which combines a limited amount of
    inversion with serial high-speed text processing in a parallel
    and distributed fashion.
