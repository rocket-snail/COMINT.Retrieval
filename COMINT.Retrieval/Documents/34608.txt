sharing development information. during the past 2 years,
    the information systems unit of the united nations department
    for international economic and social affairs has been running
    a pilot project to establish an automated information system,
    development information system, and to provide
    intradepartmental coordination of information systems
    activities. the system is now fully operational with a sample
    data base of almost 2,000 records. to avoid unnecessary
    duplication, full use was made of the devsis (development
    sciences information system) preliminary designs and the
    macrothesaurus. the minisis minicomputer system, developed by
    the international development research centre, is being tested
    for cost effectiveness. the system is compatible with several
    other united nations systems.
