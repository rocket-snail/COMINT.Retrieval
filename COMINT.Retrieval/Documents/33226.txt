equipment for excitation of spectra by high frequency
    pulses the equipment comprises a pulse generator which controls
    a clapp oscillator of followed by a frequency multiplier and
    amplifiers average hf power transferred to the discharge tube
    is about with peak power of the frequency is about mcs argon
    spectra obtained are shown
