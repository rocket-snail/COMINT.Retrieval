meanings of literacy in the third world: the concepts and
    consequences of the rijchary reform movement in highland peru.
    examines some of the conditions necessary for successful
    educational activity of the sort which would lay the foundation
    for meaningful library development in peru. highland structures
    of social and productive relations have long obstructed
    official efforts, but the rijchary movement, active in the
    department of puno in the 30s and 40s, suggests by contrast
    some of the elements that have both stirred and responded to
    indigenous aspirations. 'rijchary' means 'awaken!' and the
    movement, led by nunez butron, doctor-in-residence for puno's
    azangaro province, included campaigns for basic public hygiene,
    patriotism and literacy.
