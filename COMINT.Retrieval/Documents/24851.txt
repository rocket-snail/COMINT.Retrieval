diffraction patterns for solid delay lines solutions of
    the vector equation of equilibrium for an isotropic solid are
    presented for the special case of loss free sine waves examples
    are considered in which the distribution of a single stress
    component is selected to simulate the stress produced by a high
    frequency quartz crystal
