rectifier modulators stray capacitances in modulators of
    nominally purely resistive type always increase the conversion
    loss sets of experimental results and a normalization procedure
    are discussed the circumstances in which it is desirable to
    tune out the stray capacitances by means of inductances are
    assessed
