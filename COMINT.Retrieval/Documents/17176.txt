matching circuits for asymmetrical wire aerials a
    comparison of various types of aerial coupling circuits used
    particularly at medium and long wave lengths and of the case of
    adjustment for use at different frequencies the discussion
    shows that the most advantageous circuits consist of two
    variable reactances used in conjunction with an impedance meter
    examples of this type for use at or at medium waves are
    shown
