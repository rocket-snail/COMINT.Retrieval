quartz crystal circuit with variable coupling as
    oscillator and discriminator the principle of the fm oscillator
    described is the use of two coupled tuned circuits the second
    of which has a crystal connected in parallel a reactance valve
    drives the oscillator valve which has the first circuit
    connected between anode and a capacitor connected to the grid
    with anode feed to the centre tap on the inductor the relative
    frequency swing attainable is from to parts in impedance
    diagrams for the circuit are shown the principle is also
    applied in a discriminator in which the centre tap of the
    second circuit inductor is connected through a large value
    capacitor to the anode side of the first circuit the coupling
    between the inductors being variable the centre frequency of
    this discriminator is largely independent of the
    characteristics of the rectifying diodes
