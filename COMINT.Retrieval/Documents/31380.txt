exchange and bibliography of danish official
    publications. bilateral agreements, either intergovernmental or
    between exchange partners concerning the exchange of official
    publications have been signed between denmark and 14 foreign
    states. the danish exchange institute (ide) is in charge of
    these arrangements. ide receives the danish publications direct
    from the issuing bodies and forwards them to the foreign
    partners. at present approximately 300 danish government
    institutions publish the results of their work. foreign
    official publications received in exchange are distributed to
    danish research libraries according to their fields of
    interest, a high degree of specialisation being typical of the
    danish research library system.
