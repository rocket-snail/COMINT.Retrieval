centralisation and decentralisation' one point of view.
    examines the debate on centralisation and decentralisation in
    relation to' the historical aspects, showing how in general the
    latin american university system at present developed from the
    original european pattern; the institutional aspects, where the
    necessity for universities to fulfil their responsibilities
    dictates administrative structures, in turn governing library
    organisation; the technical-administrative aspects, outlining
    the essential characteristics of centralised, partially
    decentralised, and decentralised systems; and geographical
    factors. this survey leads to the conclusion that the
    particular circumstances of each particular case should
    determine administrative and organisational structures.
