parametric circuits at low frequencies using ferrites and
    thin magnetic films the design of parametric circuits
    incorporating ferrite cores and films with nonlinear
    characteristics is discussed films appear to be more suitable
    for operation at higher frequencies an advantage of the use of
    ferrite and magnetic film devices is their resistance to
    nuclear radiation
