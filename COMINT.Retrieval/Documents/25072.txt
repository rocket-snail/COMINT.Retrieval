the edge effect of a capacitor of finitely thick plates
    with application to magnet design conformal mapping is used to
    determine exactly the fringe capacitance and field strength
    distribution of a thick plate capacitor general formulae and
    curves are given the application to magnet systems intended for
    high frequency devices is described
