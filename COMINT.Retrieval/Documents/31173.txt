the plannable and unplannable (1)' libraries as the
    infrastructure of preservation and change. lecture given at the
    annual conference of the german library association and the
    association of librarians in north rhine-westphalia, oct 80.
    library services must react and develop in relation to social
    change. they must cater for the needs of both urban and rural
    communities, where town and country planning has so often
    failed. working hours are shorter now than in the past, so
    libraries must develop facilities for educational and
    recreational reading in conjunction with the mass media.
    children use libraries more than adults but the birth rate has
    fallen and there are more elderly people in the community today
    than before; this, however, is no excuse for a decline in
    library standards. libraries must become communication centres,
    in particular to help the many people living alone and the 4
    million foreigners in west germany.
