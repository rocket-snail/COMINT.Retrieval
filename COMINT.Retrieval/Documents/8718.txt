integrating micrographics with word processing. in 1974,
    the congressional research service (crs) installed a word
    processing (wp) system to meet expanding congressional needs.
    the wp system increased output, straining the ability of crs to
    handle its storage needs. paper was used for quick distribution
    of eye-readable materials, magnetic tape for quick retrieval of
    machine-readable storage, and microform for long-term storage.
    maintaining compatibility among the 3 storage systems became a
    formidable task, and the solution seemed to be to integrate
    storage to 1 medium. microforms offered the most effective
    method of meeting the total storage requirements.
