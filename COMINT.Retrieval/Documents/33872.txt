some theoretical and practical considerations of the
    johnsen rahbek effect the johnsen rahbek effect which is
    observed when a voltage is applied between metal and
    semiconductor surfaces in contact with one another is explained
    as due to the force across the gap which exists at all points
    except a few where contact is actually made the force increases
    with the voltage until the latter reaches the critical value
    causing field emission experiments with a clutch based on this
    effect are described the results indicate that such a device
    would be too unreliable for practical purposes the effect might
    be used in relays and gas flow valves
