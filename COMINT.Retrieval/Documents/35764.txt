general expression for the conductivity tensor and for
    the dielectric tensor in an ionized medium various applications
    hall effect and generalization of langevins formula for
    mobility a calculation to a first order of approximation is
    made of the distribution function for electrons in an ionized
    gas exposed to crossed magnetic and electric fields the rate of
    diffusion of the electrons is deduced and expressions are
    derived for the conductivity and dielectric tensors in a later
    paper the formulae obtained are to be discussed and compared
    with those established by huxley of
