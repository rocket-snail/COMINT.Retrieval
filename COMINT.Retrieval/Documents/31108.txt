quartz generators with negative feedback and an inertial
    nonlinearity theory is developed on lines similar to that
    presented by post and pit of results show that the best
    position for the amplitude limiting element is in a separate
    negative feedback circuit of the amplifier part of thetends to
    reduce the frequency and phase stability of the oscillator at
    frequencies of a few tens of kilocycles stable amplification of
    the order of can be obtained using a three stage amplifier with
    phase correction circuits stable amplification at very high and
    at very low frequencies is also mentioned
