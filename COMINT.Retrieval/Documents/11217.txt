conditions in the outer ionosphere it is found that the
    electron concentration in the outer ionosphere decreases with
    the height considerably less rapidly than it increases at lower
    levels the values obtained show that at the concentrations of
    electrons and neutral particles are of the order of and per cm
    respectively
