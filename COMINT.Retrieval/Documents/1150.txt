design of hf and if amplifiers for multi channel fm links
    bandwidth required is determined from the side band amplitudes
    for given modulation index and from the permissible distortion
    expressions for involve the derivatives of the amplifier
    response curves and are tabulated for single stage circuits and
    two stage band pass filters the computation for multistage
    circuits is shown to involve the same derivatives under ideal
    conditions second harmonic distortion would be eliminated by
    exact tuning to the central frequency and third harmonic
    distortion sufficiently reduced by using symmetrical filters
    with a coupling coefficient in practice tuning is not exact but
    second harmonic distortion can be kept at a tolerable level by
    adjustment of the pass band response at the alignment stage
    valve capacitance variations are allowed for in the shunt
    circuit capacitance neutralization can practically eliminate
    the effects of feedback via grid anode capacitance criteria for
    the choice of if are explained
