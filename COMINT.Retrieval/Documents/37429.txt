microfilm conversion in an academic physics library.
    discusses the conversion of moderately-used physics journals
    from hard copy to roll microfilm at the physics library,
    university of minnesota at minneapolis. despite initial and
    pre-conversion user resistance, conclusions based on monitoring
    the use of the filmed titles suggests that most
    non-interdisciplinary journals more than 10 years old can be
