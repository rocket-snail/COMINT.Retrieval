do librarians care for their past?. a survey of all 166
    public library authorities in the uk was carried out to
    determine whether librarians take as much care in preserving
    the correspondence, memoranda, plans, minutes and other records
    of the past, as they do in preserving information about all
    sorts of other organisations. in many cases there was evidence
    of a lack of clearly thought-out policies. reviews the results
    of the survey. in order to obtain the necessary historical
    perspective on current problems the need for a usable fund of
    source material is inescapable.
