a wide band multiplier using crystal diodes the quarter
    square multiplication is used the squaring being performed by
    networks of biased ge diodes in the feed back paths of standard
    computing amplifiers these networks have phase shifts of less
    than at and the errors of the multiplier are less than of
    maximum output
