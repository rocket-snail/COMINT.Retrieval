frequency variations of current amplification factor for
    junction transistors in a grounded emitter or grounded
    collector connection of a junction type transistor the
    effective current amplification is proportional to where is the
    current gain of the transistor as a result of the phase shift
    associated with the value of decreases rapidly with increasing
    frequency so that the upper frequency limit of the grounded
    emitter or grounded collector arrangements may be considerably
    lower than has been expected results of measurements of the
    frequency variation of for several fused impurity pnp junction
    transistors developed by saby below are shown
