current noise in composition resistors because of the
    inherent inhomogeneity of the resistor material and because the
    noise depends on the square of the current density modification
    of the resistor structure at a few points of high current
    density can have a large effect on the noise without greatly
    affecting the dc resistance experimental evidence in support of
    this view is given the effect may account for the observed lack
    of correlation between noise and dc resistance with large
    currents measurements made on resistors of the same rating but
    different types indicate a relation between noise coefficient
    and shape factor
