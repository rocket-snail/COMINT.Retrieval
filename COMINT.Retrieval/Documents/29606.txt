collection size and effectiveness in public library
    branches. describes the logan square experimental book branch
    of chicago public library. this branch library is aiming to
    provide a better service to existing users and makes no attempt
    to 'outreach' to the community. staff resources have decreased
    during the experiment and the book budget is consistent with
    those of similarly-sized libraries. in 1978-79 (the
    experiment's 1st year), the bookstock was increased from 45,000
    to 66,500 volumes (mainly by accepting discards from other
    branches) and a magazine collection was started. after
    declining for 10 years, circulation increased by 19% in 1979.
    it is too early to analyse the experiment's results, but the
    future looks good. perhaps this is a true measure of public
    library effectiveness.
