function generators based on linear interpolation with
    applications to analogue computing by using suitable
    combinations of diode circuits and high gain feedback
    amplifiers it is possible to generate functions without
    restriction to monotonic characteristics experimental results
    are presented for a sin generator in which the error is about
    of the maximum output
