elf electric fields from thunderstorms from an assumed
    cloud to ground discharge model calculations of wide band
    vertical electric field variations indicate a small decrease
    with distance up to a relation to and a relation beyond km
    radiation field spectrum analysis over the frequency range
    indicates that below long discharges produce more energy than
    short discharges and that intercloud discharges may produce as
    much as cloud to ground discharges conclusions are supported by
    experimental evidence
