measurement of variations in atmospheric refractive index
    with an airborne microwave refractometer the cavity resonator
    refractometer described is essentially the same as that used
    for previous measurements of birnbaum observations were made at
    heights up to examples of strip records obtained are reproduced
    the variations were negligible for distances m large increases
    of refractive index were observed on entering cumulus clouds
    and intense fluctuations were noted within the clouds
