selectivity and delay distortion in high frequency
    amplifiers in designing wide band amplifiers or filters a
    compromise must be reached between the conflicting requirements
    of linearity of phase characteristic maximum amplification and
    selectivity normalized curves for the attenuation phase and
    transient response characteristics of four different amplifiers
    with four tuned coupling circuits are presented and discussed
    from the point of view of design to meet specific requirements
    the four types of amplifier considered are those with single
    tuned circuits those with flat phase characteristic power law
    and tchebycheff
