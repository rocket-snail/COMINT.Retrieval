the detection of the current system in ionospheric radio
    sounding anomalies found in the application of chapmans theory
    of ionosphere layer formation of theory of ionosphere layer
    formation to layer phenomena are explicable if it is accepted
    that the current system modifies the diurnal variation of
    electron density in the layer most probably by some form of
    vertical drift mechanism similar phenomena are found in the
    layer
