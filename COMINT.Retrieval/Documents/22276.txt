amplitude distribution for radio signals reflected by
    meteor trails part vhf signals are propagated to distances of
    by reflection from meteor trails a probability distribution for
    the envelope of the received signal is derived for the case of
    reflections from numerous small meteors coincident with
    residual signals from infrequent large meteors
