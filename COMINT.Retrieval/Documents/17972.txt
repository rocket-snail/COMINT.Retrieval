coded decimal number systems for digital computers from
    the very large numbers of possible ways of coding the decimal
    digits into sets of binary elements a restricted group of
    number systems is presented as being particularly adaptable for
    representing the decimal digits in digital computers as an
    example one number system of this group is presented which
    permits the construction of a very simple addition
    circuit
