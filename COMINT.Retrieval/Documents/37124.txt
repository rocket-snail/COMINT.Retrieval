new types of dc amplifier the cascade balance system owen
    prinz method of zero drift correction is applied to the first
    of two identical amplifier stages the residual drift is then
    balanced against that of the second stage the overall drift is
    reduced times as compared with the parallel balance system a
    practical design is fully discussed
