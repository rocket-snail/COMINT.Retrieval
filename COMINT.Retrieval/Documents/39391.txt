information and literature demand. between 1970 and 78
    the number of annual literature orders received from outside by
    the central library of medicine in cologne increased by nearly
    400% to 210,000. since computerised information services
    expanded considerably during this period, the library needed
    detailed information on requested material for future planning,
    so in 1978 a survey was carried out with the help of the
    deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft (german research association).
    information from 12 libraries was obtained on the sources of
    ordered literature, the use of material by different
    professional groups, the use of computer services,
    bibliographies and abstracts, the types and language of
    material required and the type of library making the request.
    the survey's central finding was that the activities of the
    computerised information services considerably influenced user
    demand. libraries must cater for this and their financing
    bodies must support them.
