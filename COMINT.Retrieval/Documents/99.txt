on a macroscopic measurement of the spin of
    electromagnetic radiation the spin of em radiation may be
    deduced from the torque exerted at microwave frequencies by a
    circularly polarized wave upon a screen which can conduct
    current only parallel to a given direction see of calculations
    are made of the angular momentum and scattering cross sections
    of the screen and the feasibility of an accurate experiment is
    discussed
