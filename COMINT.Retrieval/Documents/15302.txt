a study of the structure of abraded metal surfaces a
    report is presented of an experimental investigation of the
    spontaneous and photoelectric electron emission from abraded
    surfaces in various atmospheres all the metals investigated
    responded to radiation in the near ultraviolet which form
    excess metal oxides responded to wavelengths in the visible
    range also from the observed rate of decay of emission it is
    inferred that both thermal and oxidation phenomena are involved
    previous theories that the emission depends on exothermal
    processes are considered untenable
