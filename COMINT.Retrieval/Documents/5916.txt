measurements of the terrestrial magnetic field in the e
    layer two methods are outlined both based on determination of
    the gyro frequency which is related by a simple formula to the
    intensity h of the geomagnetic field in the lower part of the e
    layer the first method is based on the double hump resonance
    curve and the second is based on the self demodulation of radio
    waves at carrier frequencies near gyrofrequency a stable is
    given of values of h determined by these methods in
