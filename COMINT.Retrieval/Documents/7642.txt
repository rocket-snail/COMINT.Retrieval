energy of the harmonic oscillator in vacuum continuation
    of work abstracted previously of braffort et al the term energy
    of the oscillator us used to indicate the additional energy
    acquired by a free charge on passing into the oscillating state
    the energy of the harmonic oscillator in the fluctuating field
    of the absorber is equal to the product of its natural
    frequency and a universal constant
