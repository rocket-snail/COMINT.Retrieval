cassettes-a meaningful complement to the book. if
    libraries stock cassettes, new readers are attracted to the
    library and loan figures rise. cassettes should be placed with
    or near books on the same subject; they should be classified in
    the same way as books and entered in the main catalogue. music
    cassettes are an excellent complement to music literature and
    can stimulate people to read books about music. cassettes for
    children may encourage children to read who are not yet keen
    readers; good quality cassettes must be selected since there is
    a wide range on the market in this field. language cassettes
    should be arranged on bookshelves with their accompanying
    textbooks. literature cassettes are useful for readers with
    poor sight, so they should be placed near the large print
    books; they are also helpful for people with reading
    difficulties and for group listening and discussion.
