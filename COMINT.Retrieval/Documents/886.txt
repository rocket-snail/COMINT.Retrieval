i am so envious. gives a portrait of silkeborg public
    library, denmark and compares it to the library of the author's
    childhood. interviews juditthe boock, the chairman of the
    cultural committee, who would have liked a civic centre, but
    had to be content with a 1,260 sq.m. extension in 1978 and
    acquisition of other buildings to house the local history
    collection and children's activities, now in the main library.
    would like more branch libraries in the suburbs, but regards
    mobile libraries as adequate for the authority's thinly
    populated periphery. welcomes the use of the children's library
    as a child minding service and leisure centre and approves of
    non-book material such as music and posters. interviews the
    driver and mobile librarian. children constitute 75% of mobile
    library users, with old people next in importance. a close
    relationship to the readers has developed and readers are well
    satisfied with the selection of books. interviews the chief
    librarian, povl skov, who hopes to ope n 4 new branches during
    the 80s. the cuts have hitherto affected purchase of new books
    and staffing, but services like reservations can no longer be
    exempted. accepts that the library must be subject to the same
    economic restrictions as other local services.
