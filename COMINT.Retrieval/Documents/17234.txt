the determination of ionospheric electron content from
    satellite doppler measurements part experimental results the
    results of observations made from september to december are
    presented a winter to summer variation of in total midday
    electron content was observed the diurnal variation showed an
    increasing content towards evening although the content below
    was decreasing day to day variations correlated well with
