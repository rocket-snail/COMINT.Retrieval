experimental program for online access to acs primary
    documents. chemical abstracts service typesets 16 american
    chemical society primary journals using a computer-based
    composition system. in the production of these journals, an
    archived file consisting of the text and some graphic data in
    machine-readable form is generated as a byproduct. the
    availability of the archived file has prompted us to
    investigate ways in which it may be advantageously utilised in
    the future. describes one aspect of this investigation
    involving the development and testing of an experimental
    on-line program which allows an operator to select textual
    subsets of primary documents. the preparation of articles for a
    synoptic journal is one possible future application of this
    type of program. other possible future applications of the
    developed-text access and manipulation features are
    mentioned.
