electro thermal behaviour of point contacts to
    semiconductors joule heating effects due to current flow
    through a point contact to a semiconductor with no barrier
    layer were investigated theoretically and the results were
    confirmed experimentally for tungsten points in contact with
    sintered disks of mg ti the values of the contact radius
    calculated from dc and ac experiments are in fair agreement as
    are the calculated and measured variations with frequency of
    the impedance to sinusoidal ripple superimposed on steady
    current minor anomalies in the dc characteristic are assumed to
    be due to field emission around the contact
