video in sweden (part 2). comments on the swedish video
    commission's report, published in 1981. the report discusses
    how video can be used to strengthen freedom of expression.
    quality video from abroad must be available. minority groups
    stand to benefit from video, and domination by commercial
    producers and distributors must be opposed. the report assigns
    a decisive role to public libraries as distribution channels,
    with 'videographers', media workshops and media 'cafes'
    attached to local libraries. it proposes state subsidised
    production with the swedish educational radio, the swedish
    television, and the swedish film institute, among others, as
    producers. distribution through libraries might take 3 forms'
    showing in libraries, loans to individuals and societies, via
    cable to homes and institutions. financing is to be the
    government for the 1st year and by the local authorities
    thereafter, with a possible lending charge. the report's
    thorough survey of the field should prove useful also to the
    other nordic countries. implementation of the proposals is,
    however, uncertain owing to the difficult financial position of
    the public libraries. for part 1, 2see1 the previous
    abstract.
