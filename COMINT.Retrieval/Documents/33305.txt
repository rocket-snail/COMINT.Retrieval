abac of the function for studying the initial complex
    permeability of circular cross section conductors at high
    frequency the impedance of the conductor is measured and the
    parameter is then found from the abac using a known formula the
    complex permeability is then derived using a given relation
    between and this abac supplements tht presented by prache which
    was not applicable to good conductors
