parallel series amplifier high amplification stability
    and low output impedance are achieved in a direct coupled
    circuit containing only two resistances one in the common
    cathode lead of a parallel connected double triode the other as
    the anode load of the first triode whose anode is also
    connected directly to the grid of a third triode in series with
    the second the output voltage is that between the anode of the
    second triode and the reference voltage input under appropriate
    conditions amplification where refers to the slope of the
    double triode the operation of the circuit is analysed and its
    application as an amplifier for an analogue computer a voltage
    stabilizer or a dc amplifier is described
