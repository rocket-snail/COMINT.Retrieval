how can your son become a reader?. the moscow and tul'sk
    paedagogic institutes recently investigated schoolchildren's
    waning interest in fiction and found elementary schoolchildren
    read little and were indifferent to fiction. the
    extra-curricular reading project for 1st to 3rd forms evolved.
    here children learn to examine books carefully before deciding
    on selection. after 6 months of this instruction, 65% of
    1st-formers were quickly able to find the books required. the
    method is supplemented by reading aloud stories about the text,
    literary games, competitions, etc. the aim is to familiarise
    1st to 3rd-formers with some of the best russian, soviet and
    foreign literature. librarians should consolidate on these
    earliest school reading habits. school library coordination is
    necessary.
