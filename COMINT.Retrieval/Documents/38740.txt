on sunspots and magnetic storms study of the correlation
    between active sunspots and geomagnetic storms shows that the
    effect of central meridian passage of active sunspots on the
    occurrence of storms is more evident when the activity is
    defined by both the spot type and the magnetic character than
    by the spot type alone this is particularly noticeable in the
    case of geomagnetic storms with gradual commencements
