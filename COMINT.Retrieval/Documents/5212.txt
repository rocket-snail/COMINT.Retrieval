electronic conduction in solids with spherically
    symmetric band structure elastic scattering of electrons by
    ionized impurities and inelastic scattering by the non
    acoustical modes of the lattice vibrations in a homopolar
    crystal are discussed for electrons whose energy is a
    nonquadratic function of the wave number vector
