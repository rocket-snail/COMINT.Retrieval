concerning ionospheric turbulence at the meteoric level a
    discussion on the application of fluid mechanics to meteoric
    phenomena is continued with particular reference to a rough

    of large and small eddies the paper is mainly concerned with
    the relative merits of work by booker and cohen and by manning
