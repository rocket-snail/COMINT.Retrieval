studies on 2economics abstracts international1' a new
    online database. describes the results of a series of test
    searches carried out on 2economics abstracts international1
    (eai), a relatively new on-line bibliographic data base
    covering economics and marketing information. in particular,
    the data base was compared to the well-established predicasts
    family of data bases. it was found that they are complementary,
    in that for particular types of search (e.g. company
    information), predicasts is a better service and for others
    (e.g. theoretical economics) eai is superior. in the field of
    marketing information, both provide hits. predicasts identified
    short, up-to-date news items and eai in-depth studies. critical
    comments are made on geographic coverage, on the use of
    universal decimal classification numbers for subject-matter
    searching, and on the timeliness of eai.
