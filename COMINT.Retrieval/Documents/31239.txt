the nevitron mercury arc rectifier description of a new
    type of rectifier with the hg pool in a mo cup with external al
    cooling fins provided the mo cup is wetted by the hg to give a
    concave meniscus the cathode spot runs in a continuous line
    round the edge of the hg the cooling system ensures no
    excessive emission of vapour an auxiliary electrode lifted from
    the hg by means of a solenoid serves to start the arc the
    voltage drop across the arc is the weight of a nevitron is only
    excluding the ignition solenoid types with grid control have
    also been tested the power required in the grid circuit for
    full control is only one thousandth of that for a multianode
    rectifier
