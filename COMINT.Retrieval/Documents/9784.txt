danish school library association annual meeting 1981.
    report of a paper given at the 1981 annual meeting of denmark's
    school library association by lise ostergaard. the controversy
    over the transfer of responsibility for danish school libraries
    to the ministry of education from the ministry of culture is
    reviewed. it is the task of the local authorities, however, to
    ensure the operation and development of public and school
    libraries, so that they work together in promoting cultural,
    informational and educational activities. the change in the law
    governing school libraries is a step forward, strengthening
    cooperation between the various types of library controlled by
    central government and local authorities. production of books
    for children and young people is important and has increased
    greatly in denmark over the last 10-20 years, largely due to
    the expansion of children's libraries. 80% of all danish
    children's books are purchased by public, school and
    institutional libraries. the fut ure of such books depends on
    the willingness of local authorities, in spite of budgetary
    problems, to provide young people with a broad range of
    literature.
