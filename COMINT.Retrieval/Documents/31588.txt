the facts about censorship in public libraries. in the
    1978/79 academic year students of the frederik muller school of
    librarianship carried out a survey into censorship in public
    libraries in the netherlands. 15 libraries, varying in size
    from small town to large city libraries, were selected, 5 in
    areas with a strong protestant leaning, 5 in roman catholic
    areas and 5 in areas with no strong religious convictions. the
    results showed that the number of controversial books stocked
    by libraries was in direct proportion to the size of the
    library. in addition, despite the assurances of all librarians
    that no form of censorship was practised, fewer books of a
    politically-controversial or pornographic nature were to be
    found in libraries in religious areas. it is clear that
    censorship is still alive in the netherlands in 1981 under the
    guise of 'rejection on ethical grounds'.
