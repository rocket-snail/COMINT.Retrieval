resistive bidirectional coupler a resistive t network is
    discussed which when inserted between a source and a load acts
    as a bidirectional coupler providing voltages proportional
    respectively to the incident and reflected waves the
    arrangement is applicable to measurement purposes and is used
    eg in the wattmeter described by ryder and mcvay
