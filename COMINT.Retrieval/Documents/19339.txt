a radio astronomical investigation of drift movements in
    the upper atmosphere discussion of night time observational
    data of the diffraction of rf radiation from radio stars by
    moving irregularities in the ionosphere f region obtained at
    jodrell bank during the period using three receiving equipments
    triangularly sited and operating at the drift velocity at
    temperature latitudes is normally of the order of during the
    first half eastwards the reversal occurring around in the
    auroral zone the velocity is of the order of and the changes in
    direction are less marked results for points separated by
    suggest that the drift speed and directions are the same over
    wide areas
