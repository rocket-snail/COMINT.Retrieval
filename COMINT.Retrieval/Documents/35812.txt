electrical discharges recent work on electrical
    discharges is surveyed under the following headings the
    breakdown of gases in static fields high frequency discharges
    cold emission phenomena the regime of space charges breakdown
    is regarded as a consequence of the development of pre
    breakdown ionization currents by primary and secondary
    processes which are themselves controlled by the nature and
    geometry of the cathode the important part played by surface
    films in the cold extraction of electrons from electrodes is
    described rf plasma oscillations and the generation of noise by
    discharges is discussed
