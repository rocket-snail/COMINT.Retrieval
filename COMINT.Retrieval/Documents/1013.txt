an exploratory study of three subject access systems in
    medicine' lcsh, mesh, precis. (phd thesis-university of
    pittsburgh). examines the see also reference structures
    (syndetic structures) of 3 subject access systems used in
    medicine-precis, mesh, and lcsh. explores their differences and
    similarities in an effort to develop the best possible
    structure using features of all 3. 3 variables were
    evaluated-subject area coverage, browseability, and
    flexibility. maps were developed for the subject headings in
    each system and compared with maps developed from recognised
    'classic' textbooks; this procedure readily identified gaps in
    coverage and inconsistencies in terminology control. such maps
    could be converted to computer displays to improve precision
    and recall in bibliographic data base searching.
