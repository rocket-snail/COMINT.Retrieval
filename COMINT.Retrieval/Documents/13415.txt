rc and lc resonant filters and their application i
    selective amplifiers the design of a narrow b nd amplifier with
    a centre frequency of about is discussed following a comparison
    of circuits with different types of filter elements a two stage
    circuit with negative feedback and incorporating a rc band stop
    filter was the design adopt d or use in the measurement of the
    solar magnetic field
