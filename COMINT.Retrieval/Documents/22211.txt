u.s. government produced audiovisual materials. us
    government produced audio-visual materials offer a valuable
    information resource which is often overlooked by librarians
    and library users. the librarian who is knowledgeable about
    their availability will be able to bring these audio-visual
    materials to the attention of library patrons to whom they
    could be useful. knowledge of the indexes and lists which have
    been specially compiled for these resources will make them as
    accessible as the more familiar print government
    documents.
