excitation of spin waves in ferromagnets eddy current and
    boundary condition effects the boundary condition for
    transverse magnetization is derived when there is a surface
    anisotropy field spinwave modes can be excited by a uniform r f
    field and the power absorbed in each mode in an insulator can
    be calculated the eddy currents have a large effect only on
    long wavelength spin waves
