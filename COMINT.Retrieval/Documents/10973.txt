photochemical rates in the equatorial f region from the
    eclipse it is deduced tiat temperature changes and transport of
    electrons were probably negligible during the eclipse formulae
    are given for the rate of photoionization and the linear
    recombination coefficient as a function of height and the total
    rate of absorption of energy in the f region is deduced
