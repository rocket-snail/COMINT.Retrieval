fair play with the cake, you know?'.d iscusses the
    economic cuts as they affect the library services. the
    government's savings circular recommended that local
    authorities cut library expenditure to 185 kr per capita, as,
    it was argued, public libraries showed signs of uncontrolled
    growth. the librarians' union has, however, calculated public
    libraries' real growth in 1980 as within the government's
    recommended 3%; this is supported by the library inspectorate.
    the figures for 1981 indicate an average fall in real growth of
    1.4%. the librarians' union has examined the local effects of
    cuts and found that fringe services like outreach activities
    are worst hit and that staff appointments are frozen. the
    government's technocrats have drawn up models for the
    development of the public sector, but librarians' answer must
    be that the development of the library part of this sector is
    not a technical matter only, but that cultural aspects are
    equally important.
