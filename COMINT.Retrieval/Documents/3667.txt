scientific librarian? library scientist? scientifically
    trained librarian? or developing training demands of a
    developing profession. contribution to a thematic issue on
    library training. laszlo matrai has suggested that library
    science does not exist and that a librarian should be a
    scientist of the subject field cared for and served by him, but
    by no means a library scientist. thus library skills should be
    attained by practice. the author feels that the transmission of
    information in a library is a complex operation, requiring
    training at a higher education level. this training,
    incorporating up-to-date knowledge, is the essence of the
    library profession and is essential in the development of
    information systems and networks.
