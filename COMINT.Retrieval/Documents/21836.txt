sound archives and the development of the birs. an
    account of the founding of the british institute of recorded
    sound and its national sound archive, its development, and its
    activities. its brief was to establish a fully comprehensive
    archive, international in scope, though with a special
    responsibility for preserving uk material, covering all aspects
    of knowledge and experience. it records radio programmes,
    poetry readings, and theatre productions; receives 1,000
    commercial gramophone records monthly; contains the british
    library of wildlife sounds (blows); has ethnomusicological
    recordings from throughout the world; and has a library of
    written matter. it organises lectures and provides a free
    public listening service. in spring 80, computerisation of the
    index was begun and it is hoped that a catalogue will be
    produced.
