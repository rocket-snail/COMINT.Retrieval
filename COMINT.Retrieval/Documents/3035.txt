project jason measurement of trapped electrons from a
    nuclear device by sounding rockets highaltitude sounding
    rockets have been used to observe electrons injected into the
    geomagnetic field from the highaltitude nuclear detonations of
    the argus experiment the results of these observations agree
    with those measured by satellite explorer the trapping of
    neutron decay particles from large yield highaltitude
    explosions in the pacific was also observed
