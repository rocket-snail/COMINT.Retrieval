a new coaxial resonator filter a band pass filter with an
    m derived type of characteristic is described consisting of
    loop coupled coaxial resonators in a reentrant arrangement
    performance may be described in terms of an equivalent lattice
    network good agreement is shown between the experimental and
    theoretical insertion loss characteristics
