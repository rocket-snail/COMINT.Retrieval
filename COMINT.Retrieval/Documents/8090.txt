using qualitative methods. contribution to a special
    issue on application of qualitative approaches to the study of
    information problems. an in-depth discussion of one qualitative
    approach-ethnography. its distinctive character derives from
    its underlying methodological principles-a concern with the
    discovery, generation, and development, as well as testing, of
    theory; a commitment to learning the culture of those being
    studied; and a recognition of the importance of context.
    against this background, outlines some ethnographical
    techniques-grounded theorising (theoretical sampling and the
    constant comparative method) and testing theory (triangulation
    and analytic induction). stresses that this is a research
    tradition still in the throes of development.
