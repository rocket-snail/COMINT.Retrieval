calculation of the capacitance of a circular annulus by
    the method of subareas an approximation method is described and
    applied to the determination of the capacitance and charge
    distribution of a circular annulus and of a circular disk the
    fourth approximations for the capacitance are in good agreement
    with the known exact values
