microwave single sideband modulator using ferrites the
    modulator uses a ferrite rod inserted in a waveguide section
    and subjected to a rotating transverse magnetic field as a
    phase shifter a transmission type and a reflection type are
    described both are designed to shift the frequency of an x band
    signal by
