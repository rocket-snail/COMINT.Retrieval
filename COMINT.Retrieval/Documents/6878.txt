fjell branch, drammen' minimum library in populous
    suburb. vacated postal and bank premises in fjell, norway, were
    taken over in sept 80 as a provisional solution to the acute
    need for library facilities in a tower-block suburb with 6,000
    inhabitants. though only 105 sq.m. (40% of the area needed),
    the premises were suitable for library use with minimum
    alteration, accommodating 3,500 adult and 2,500 junior books,
    and reading places for adults and children. with such
    restricted space, priority is being given to serving the least
    mobile sections of the community, old people, children and
    housewives.
