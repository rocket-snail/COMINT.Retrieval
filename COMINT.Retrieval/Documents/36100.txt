relations between the critical frequency of the
    ionosphere f layer at freiburg and solar activity centres
    during the years analysis is made separately for night time and
    day time observations no significant variation of f layer
    critical frequency was associated with the passage of those
    sunspots giving no rf radiation on passage of sunspots giving
    rf radiation the night time critical frequency suffered a
    significant reduction while the day time value was not
    significantly affected this night time effect is in concordance
    with observations of ionospheric absorption reported by davies
    and hagg of june
