the role of cold electron emission due to field effect in
    the maintenance at the cathode of an electric discharge in a
    highly rarified gas the hypothesis of electron emission at the
    cathode under the influence of the space charge due to positive
    ions is proposed and supported by preliminary experimental
    results
