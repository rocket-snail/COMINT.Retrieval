the frequency lock afc circuit noise free operation of
    the system is analysed and its performance at low signal noise
    ratios is considered a theory of the system operation under the
    latter conditions is developed from an examination of the
    tracking errors resulting from noise and changes in signal
    frequency practical results obtained are in agreement with this
    theory
