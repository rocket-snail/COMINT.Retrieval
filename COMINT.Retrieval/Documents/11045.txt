read to them. few parents regularly read stories aloud to
    their children. the affectionate atmosphere given by reading a
    story is reassuring and security-building at any age. it is a
    mistake to discontinue the practice. the child learns language,
    and about the written word through this. reading to him can
    help him to understand concepts he cannot grasp by reading to
    himself. literature with humour, insight and maturity needs to
    be sought. children from literary rather than gifted
    backgrounds are the best readers.
