geomagnetically trapped electrons from cosmic ray albedo
    neutrons the energy spectrum for outer belt electrons derived
    from a neutron albedo source is calculated the spectrum peaks
    at whereas rocket results indicate no such peak there is fair
    agreement above only the small fraction of electrons above can
    be accounted for by a neutron albedo source the capetown
    anomaly is found to give only a relative minimum in the
    equatorial plane compared with the observed
