quantum effects in the interaction between free electrons
    and electromagnetic fields a discussion of the possibility of
    arranging experiments so that the spread of an electron beam in
    a transverse field due to the quantum dispersion of the energy
    exchange can be distinguished from that due to practical
    experimental factors
