influence of large fluctuations on an electronic relay
    the probability of untimely triggering by fluctuation voltages
    is considered theoretically the cases discussed include the
    effect of fluctuations on a relay with or without inertia both
    in the presence and in the absence of regular pulses the effect
    on a coincidence type circuit is also discussed
