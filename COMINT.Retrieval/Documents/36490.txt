effect of vertical drifts on the nocturnal ionization of
    the lower ionosphere vertical ionic drifts present in quiet
    conditions and enhanced during a magnetic storm result in a
    vertical redistribution of ionization and thus change the
    apparent recombination coefficient at a given height the
    resulting n profiles are calculated and shown to explain the
    sudden cessation of night time echoes of lf radio waves at
    times of magnetic disturbance reported by linquist
