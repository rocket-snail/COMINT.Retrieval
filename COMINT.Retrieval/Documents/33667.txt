the optimum piston position for wide band coaxial to
    waveguide transducers matching of a coaxial line to a waveguide
    can be effected by means of a probe located ahead of a short
    circuiting piston in the waveguide matching can usually be
    achieved by varying any two of the following dimensions off
    centre distance of the probe probe length distance from piston
    to probe as there is theoretically an optimum piston position
    giving greatest bandwidth it is convenient to vary dimensions
    and experimental results are quoted which corroborate the
    theory bandwidths to the swr points were obtained
