national needs for critically evaluated physical and
    chemical data. reliable values of numerical data that express
    in quantitative terms the properties and behaviour of materials
    are essential in all branches of science and technology and are
    needed to arrive at valid decisions whenever a governmental or
    industrial decision involves elements of science and
    technology. the scientific literature contains many valuable
    data covering a wide range of diverse fields. unfortunately, it
    also contains many erroneous values. a substantial intellectual
    effort is a required to select reliable values from the total
    of those reported. for this reason, a number of specialised
    data centres have been established to compile and evaluate data
    in a systematic fashion.
