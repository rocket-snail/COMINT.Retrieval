greenland's library service through 150 years. 1980 was
    the 150th anniversary of greenland's 1st public library (in the
    capital, godthab) and was also the year in which responsibility
    for the country's library service passed from denmark to
    greenland's home government. briefly outlines the service's
    history up to 1956 and describes subsequent events in greater
    detail. in 1956, a proper country-wide service was established
    to provide danish-language children's books to support teaching
    of danish in schools, and greenlandic material for those
    speaking only that language. the main library in godthab (later
    designated the greenland national library) began to build a
    collection of greenlandic material. the library service's main
    handicap is the acute shortage of material in
    greenlandic.
