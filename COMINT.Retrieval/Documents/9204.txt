improving round-off in runge-kutta computations with
    gill's method a runge-kutta-gill scheme in common use is based
    on an incomplete adaptation for floating point operations of
    gill's method. an improved version reduces round-off error
    significantly. in this note the heart of the scheme is
    presented in fortran language. it is then shown how an improved
    version of the method can be obtained with the addition of two
    fortran statements. the two version is a significant
    improvement. a numerical example comparing the two is included.
