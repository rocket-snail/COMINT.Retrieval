electron effective mass in solids a generalization of
    bardeens formula a formula is derived for the effective mass of
    an electron in a crystal which replaces the sum over excited
    states in the usual sum rule by an integral over the surface of
    the unit cell the integrand of the surface integral involves
    the wave functions at the symmetry point or band extremum ad a
    second solution of schroedingers equation at the same energy
    but satisfying inhomogeneous boundary conditions on th cell
    surface
