the media centre in a vocational training school.
    students in a vocational training school will include former
    pupils of both grammar and secondary modern schools. some
    students will be on part time, some on full time courses; most
    of them will have had some work experience and many will have
    practical rather than academic ability. the media centre needs
    a wide range of subject material for all academic levels.
    self-teaching programmes are very important; audio-visual media
    are particularly helpful in demonstrating the operation of
    machinery. some students will have learning difficulties and a
    lack of motivation; provision of material for leisure as well
    as academic activities should encourage them to use the
    library, where they may find their last chance to make up for
    educational deficits. the media centre should also promote the
    idea of job flexibility.
