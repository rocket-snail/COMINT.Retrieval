diffusion coefficients from the rate of decay of meteor
    trails an estimate of the diffusion coefficient in the meteor
    zone is obtained by an extension of huxleys theory of ambipolar
    diffusion the absolute value of the diffusion coefficient thus
    calculated and its gradient with height are confirmed by
    comparison with results of measurements made at adelaide using
    radar technique at a wavelength of the theory appears adequate
    to account for the observed variation or diffusion coefficient
    with height
