fluid self excited dynamo the possibility that a simply
    connected perfectly conducting fluid body could generate an
    increasing external magnetic field by acting as a self excited
    dynamo is demonstrated by exhibiting a cycle of motions that
    doubled the external field each cycle the essential feature of
    the motion is that interior points become surface points
