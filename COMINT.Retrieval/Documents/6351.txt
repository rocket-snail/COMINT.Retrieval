on deviations from ohms law in metals it is shown on the
    basis of the kinetic equations of electrons in metals in strong
    fields that the deviations observed are due primarily to the
    delayed transmission of energy at the collision of electrons
    with the lattice at sufficiently low temperatures the
    resistance should pass through a minimum at a given
    current
