network analysis by repeated voltage superposition a
    method of analysis is described with worked out examples which
    reduces considerably the number of simultaneous equations to be
    solved for an m mesh network the method essentially involves
    successive applications of thevenins theorem each application
    reducing by one the number of meshes in the network considered
    with a corresponding reduction of the number of simultaneous
    equations to be solved a similar method has been described by
    tasny tschiassny of who used residual current generators at the
    final nodes instead of residual voltage generators in the final
    branches and whose method differs from the present method in
    other details
