dissemination of information on energy conservation to
    small energy users. an institutional network that provides
    homeowners, small businesses, and other small-scale energy
    users with access to information on energy conservation
    techniques and alternative energy technologies was created when
    the national energy extension service (ees) was established in
    1978. to help ees provide practical reference materials and
    responsive technical assistance to state energy extension
    service offices, the center for energy policy and research
    (cepr) of the new york institute of technology was retained by
    the us department of energy to set up and operate a national
    information clearinghouse for the energy extension service.
    through this clearinghouse cepr produces and delivers to all
    states and us territories monthly energy information packages
    that contain complete copies or summaries of practical
    reference materials on energy conservation and alternative
    energy sources, as well as retrieval aids for all package
    enclosures.
