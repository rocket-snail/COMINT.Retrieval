dynamical structure of the ionospheric f layer formulae
    giving diffusion velocity and its divergence are derived for
    the electron ion gas in the ionosphere on the assumption of a
    linear temperature gradient the change in electron density
    distribution is then calculated using these formulae for
    different models of the ionosphere comparisons of the
    calculated and observed changes in the f layer show that
    bradburys rather than chapmans theory is more
    appropriate
