use of complex conductivity in the representation of
    dielectric phenomena a representation for complex conductivity
    is proposed in which a simple debye mechanism results in a
    semicircular locus a non zero value of dc conductivity does not
    cause this plot to lose its unique shape in the low frequency
    range
