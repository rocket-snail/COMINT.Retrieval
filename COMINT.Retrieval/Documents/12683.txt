audio frequency electromagnetic radiation in the auroral
    zone spectrograms of the energy in the frequency range were
    recorded in n sweden during the winter and early summer of the
    energy is low during the day and high at night and the ratio is
    greatest in the range no clear cut correlation with magnetic
    indices could be found except during some geomagnetic
    disturbances the main contribution to the energy probably
    originates in atmospheric noise from thunderstorms but magnetic
    fluctuations may be important at lower frequencies
