noise power radiated by tropical thunderstorms lightning
    discharge phenomena are reviewed and an expression is derived
    for the average electric field due to a stroke the power at the
    source corresponding to the noise field strength measurements
    of which were reported previously of january is hence evaluated
    over the frequency range the noise power varies as discharges
    within the cloud or into the air are the main noise
    sources
