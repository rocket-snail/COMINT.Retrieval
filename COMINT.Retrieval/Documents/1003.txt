culture in hedemora-a challenge. describes the cultural
    life of a small local authority, hedemora (sweden). remarks on
    the concept of culture as outlined in the official programme,
    where the dreams are put forward, and warns against expanding
    it into absurdity. divides the concept into' popular and
    amateur culture, nurtured by societies and study circles and
    exemplified by biennial art exhibitions, an anthology of poems,
    craft demonstrations and musical events during the summer; high
    culture, as represented by the drama, art and chamber music
    societies and the library which aim to preserve the cultural
    heritage; and children's culture. this aspect is neglected as
    the library has a poor children's section and no children's
    librarian.
