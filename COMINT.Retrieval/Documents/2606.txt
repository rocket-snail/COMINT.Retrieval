effect of a gravitational field due to a rotating body on
    the plane of polarization of an electromagnetic wave it is
    shown that for electromagnetic waves the gravitational field of
    a rotating body acts as an optically active medium thus the
    plane of polarization of the wave rotates while it passes
    through this field the effect is small the angle of rotation
    due to the gravitational field of the sun is about
    radian
