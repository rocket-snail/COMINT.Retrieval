calculation of the natural frequency of a type cavity
    partly filled with an absorbing dielectric the system
    considered comprises a re entrant cylindrical cavity resonator
    with a solid dielectric specimen in the form of a truncated
    cone placed between the base of the cylinder and the butt end
    of the inner conductor formulae derived for the natural
    frequency and the damping can be used also to determine the
    components of the complex dielectric constant of the specimen
    this analysis also provides the theoretical basis of the
    measurement method described by works and others
