bibliometric studies on a protein-rich crop: the cowpea.
    2 bibliographies on cowpeas, one covering the period 1888-1949
    and the other 1950-1973, were analysed to study various
    characteristics of the literature. results showed that growth
    of the literature has been exponential, doubling every 20
    years, with the english language accounting for over 87% of the
    literature. though the periodical was the most popular
    publishing medium, format changes were evident and bradford
    distributions of the 2 groups resulted in a third bradford
    distribution when merged.
