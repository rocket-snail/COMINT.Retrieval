effect of electron exchange on the dispersion relation of
    plasma oscillations the dispersion relation is derived from a
    canonical transformation slightly different from that of bohm
    and pines a correction factor is introduced for electron
    exchange effects but agreement between theory and experiment is
    not thereby improved
