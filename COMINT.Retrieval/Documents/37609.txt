concepts of reference service in academic libraries. to
    ascertain the attitudes of reference librarians in academic
    libraries towards reference service, an enquiry based on
    personal interviews and questionnaires was carried out during
    part of 1979 and 80. the survey population was selected from
    the 3 melbourne university libraries and 3 of the larger
    colleges of advanced education libraries. interviews were
    designed to provide information about attitudes to reference
    provision, and questionnaires sought to measure respondents'
    attitudes towards specific reference services as expressed by
    the acceptance or rejection of an opinion of such a service.
    findings suggest that professional education and on the job
    training may be both haphazard and ineffectual. it appears that
    a reassessment of the whole of the professional education and
    training might be in order.
