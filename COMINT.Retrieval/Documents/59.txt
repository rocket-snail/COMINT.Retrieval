current fluctuation phenomena in current carrying sliding
    contacts an account is given of an experimental investigation
    of sliding contacts as sources of interference voltages the
    dependence of the noise characteristics on sliding speed and
    current intensity is examined most of the observed phenomena
    have a thermal origin several ranges of operation involving
    different mechanisms are distinguished
