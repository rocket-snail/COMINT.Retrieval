horizontal winds and ionization drifts in the ionosphere
    from a study of geomagnetic observations during the
    international polar year it is concluded that ionization drifts
    in the f region are due to an applied electric field and not to
    air movement while in the e region the ionization drift is
    almost the same as the air movement
