stability criteria for an electrical or mechanical system
    with distributed parameters for electrical or mechanical
    systems with distributed parameters or with an element
    producing a finite time delay to be stable all the roots of the
    appropriate characteristic equation must be negative or have
    negative real parts if these equation is expressed in the form
    then for positive must be positive and must be greater than a
    certain critical value which is a functions of the example is
    given of the application of these criteria to a
    servomechanism
