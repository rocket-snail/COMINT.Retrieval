energy loss by a charged particle passing through a
    laminar dielectric part a general expression has been obtained
    for losses of a particle moving in an unbounded laminar medium
    or a waveguide filled with a dielectric polarization losses are
    examined and an expression for the spectral distribution of
    parametric cherenkov radiation is derived
