libraries, librarians and disabled persons: helping or
    handicapping?. discusses the efforts of librarians toward
    creating an awareness of, and initiating a response to, the
    library needs of the print-handicapped. these efforts have been
    confined to a relatively small group of librarians, who through
    individual and committee endeavours have managed to arouse the
    conscience of the profession and force it into meaningful
    action. the international year of the disabled has emphasised
    the need for people to firstly understand and secondly cater
    for the needs of handicapped people.
