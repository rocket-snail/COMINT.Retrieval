limits to collaborative authorship in science publishing.
    evidence is presented to demonstrate that the tendency for
    increased collaboration in science publishing does not proceed
    without limit. there appears to be a maximum extent of
    collaboration, related to the optimum size of a research unit.
    empirical corrections to allow for the sociological differences
    between various science subjects enable a generalised curve to
    be generated which appears to be a feature of research groups'
    dynamics. the study incorporates publication data from one
    research division over the last fifty years, with the
    time-independence of the relationship established by
    interpolation with similar data for 13 other new zealand
    research divisions for the period 1970 to 1977.
