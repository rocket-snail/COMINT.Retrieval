secondary processes due to absorption of the lyman lines
    emitted from aurorae discussion indicated that the line of the
    hydrogen lyman series emitted from aurorae my be effective in
    ionizing in the lower atmosphere but not to the extent required
    for polar blackouts absorption of the lyman line by oxygen
    atoms is not significant in ordinary aurorae
