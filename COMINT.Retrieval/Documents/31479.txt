some considerations about the epistemological situation
    of library science. a postgraduate paper presented at ufmg
    library school, brazil, examining the validity of the
    scientific status claimed for librarianship. the distinction
    between science and technology is clarified, and recent
    theoretical studies on library science adduced as evidence that
    although in theory librarianship is scientific in character, in
    practice it is rather a technology. in conclusion the
    non-scientific characteristics of librarianship are analysed
    and a programme presented for achieving a proper scientific
    basis.
