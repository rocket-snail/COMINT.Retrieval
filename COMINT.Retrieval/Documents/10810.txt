a study on the triggering of a plate coupled
    multivibrator by negative pulses experimental observations
    showed that voltage waveforms at different electrodes were
    markedly influenced by the form of the input pulses that
    triggering action depended largely on the input pulse amplitude
    that triggering might not take place for either very small or
    very large pulse amplitudes depending on circuit arrangement
    but larger amplitudes caused greater difficulties analysis of
    the circuit response to pulses of various durations and
    amplitudes gave results supporting the observations
