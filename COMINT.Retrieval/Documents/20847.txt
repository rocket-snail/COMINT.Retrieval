propagation of solar cosmic rays through interplanetary
    magnetic field type polar blackouts are closely associated with
    solar flares which are accompanied by type noise outbursts the
    delay before the commencement of the type blackout is about
    hours for flares in the east sector of the sun and about hours
    for flares in the west the difference is ascribed to a regular
    distortion of the outer solar magnetic field the commencement
    of the geomagnetic storm is not dependent on the solar
    longitude of the flare
