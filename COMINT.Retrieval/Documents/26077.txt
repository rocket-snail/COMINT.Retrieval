space charge effects in field emission a progressive
    reduction of the observed field current below values expected
    from the empirical law for increasing values of the potential
    is attributed to space charge the current density expected in
    the presence of space charge is calculated from the fowler
    nordheim field emission theory using values of the cathode
    electric field obtained from a solution of poissons equation
    for plane electrodes with boundary conditions appropriate to
    field emission the result is a generalization of childs
    equation and is asymptotic to it when the applied potential is
    large compared with the value for appreciable field
    emission
