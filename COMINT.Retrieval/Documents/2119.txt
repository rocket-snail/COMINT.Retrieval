thermodielectric effect a theory is put forth to explain
    the electrical effects which accompany phase changes occurring
    in dielectrics and aqueous solutions ionic movement in the
    interface is treated as a transition between energy levels
    separated by potential barriers the height of the barriers and
    the value of the energy levels are supposed to be diferent for
    positive and negative ions such a model results in a net
    current flow across the solid liquid interace when the
    interface moves during a phase change of the system the excess
    electric charges thus produced constitute space charges in the
    solid and surface charges in the liquid see also of september
