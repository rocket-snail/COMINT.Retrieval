an optimal real-time algorithm for planar convex hulls an
    algorithm is described for the construction in real-time of the
    convex hull of a set of n points in the plane. using an
    appropriate data structure, the algorithm constructs the convex
    hull by successive updates, each taking time o(log n), thereby
    achieving a total processing time o(n log n). july, 1979
