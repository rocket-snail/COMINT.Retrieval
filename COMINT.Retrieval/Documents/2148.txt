on the d electron and ion density distributions from the
    lower up to the uppermost pz part of the f region the thesis
    that the main ionizing radiations in the f region are the
    helium resonance lines at and the lyma continuum leads to the
    following results the calculated electron density distribution
    in the lower f region is in good agreement with experimental
    electron density profiles the observed and calculated relative
    abundances of the ions and are not in good agreement unless
    their charge exchange reactions are assumed to be a few orders
    of magnitude slower than expected on simple theory and if a
    scale height gradient of is assumed then the calculated and
    experimental electron densities are in agreement up to above
    the f region maximum
