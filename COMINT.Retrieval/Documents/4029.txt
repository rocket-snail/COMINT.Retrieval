zero field masers solid state three level masers
    operating with zero magnetic field are shown to be feasible and
    to have advantages over magnetic field masers in many
    applications the requirements of the working substance are
    discussed and it is found that compounds of cr fe ni and gd
    should be suitable diagrams and tables of maser properties of
    selected compounds are given on the basis of present knowledge
    a number of amplifying frequencies between and should be
    available the range of suitable compounds which has been
    studied is very small and should be extended
