the location of the auroral absorption zone a study of
    data from a chain of radio wave field strength recording
    stations along the meridian suggests that the auroral
    absorption zone coincides with the zone of maximum frequency of
    occurrence of visible aurora the significance of the results
    for radio communications across the zone is discussed
