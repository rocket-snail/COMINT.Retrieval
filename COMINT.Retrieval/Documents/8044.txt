lack of standardization of the journal title data element
    in databases. the problem of data element representation is
    more extensive than most perceive. the number of standards
    (internal, national, and international) is large, but the use
    of standards in data bases is not widespread. the result is a
    significant lack of standardisation both within and across data
    bases. the result becomes apparent when one attempts an
    exhaustive search on a particular data element in multiple data
    bases. the journal title element was studied in 8 data bases,
    and 4 measures were developed to show the extent of
    standardisation within a data base and some of its implications
    for searching.
