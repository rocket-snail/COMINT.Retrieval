a digital potentiometer description of an instrument
    developed for use with a teleprinter perforator for feeding
    measured voltage readings into an electronic computer by
    comparing the input signal voltage with a series of reference
    voltages the former is represented in integers on a binary or
    decimal scale tests on a stage instrument described indicate
    that a reliable stage unit with a reading time under can be
    constructed with readily available components
