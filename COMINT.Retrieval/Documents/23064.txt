the war of aacr 2: victors or victims?. the
    anglo-american cataloguing rules (2nd edition)-aacr 2-provide a
    case study of achievement, controversy, and failure. while
    proponents applaud the 'internal harmony' of aacr 2, observers
    note the sacrifices already made to transatlantic expendients
    and critics seek to delay implementation. discusses the
    revision of aacr and explores the actions and possible motives
    of various participants to provide a better understanding of
    the conflict. the lack of support for aacr 2 can be explained
    partially by the uncertainty about its implementation costs,
    the difficulty of justifying its benefits, and the feeling that
    it intrudes on more important local priorities. makes some
    suggestions for improving the effectiveness of the next aacr
    revision.
