hydromagnetic theory of geomagnetic storms the sudden
    commencement of a magnetic storm is attributed to the collision
    of solar plasma with the geomagnetic field the disturbance
    being propagated to earth by a hydromagnetic wave the initial
    positive phase is attributed te sustained pressure by the
    plasma the main negative phase by breakup and diffusion of the
    plasma which is trapped in orbits in the van allen belt and the
    recovery by conversion of trapped protons into neutral
    hydrogen
