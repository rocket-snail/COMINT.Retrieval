stoic influences in librarianship: a critique. paper
    presented at library history seminar vi 'libraries &
    culture', austin, texas, 19-22 mar 80. expresses a deep
    indebtedness by librarians and information scientists to the
    thought and culture of ancient greece, but sounds a warning to
    information scientists that some of the lessons learned from
    the greeks are being blindly and unthinkingly misapplied today,
    to the detriment of clear thinking about library problems.
    describes the ancient greek theory of the sign expressing the
    relation between words, thoughts, and things which is still
    influential in philosophy, linguistics, and psychology, but is
    often inappropriately invoked in these disciplines and in
    library and information science and the study of communication.
    the model is ambiguous, and so an alternative, based on human
    linguistics, is proposed.
