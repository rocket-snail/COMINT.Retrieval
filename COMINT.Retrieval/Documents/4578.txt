amplifier low frequency compensation general expressions
    are deduced for the indicial response ie response to unit step
    input and gain frequency and phase frequency response leading
    to conditions for maximal flatness compensation is then
    considered together with the effects of negative feedback
    multistage amplifiers are also discussed
