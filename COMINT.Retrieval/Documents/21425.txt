natural frequencies of coils and windings digest only
    calculations for an equivalent circuit consisting of reactors
    only were made using punched card equipment an ac network
    analyser the effect of neglecting the mutual inductance between
    elements partly or completely is shown graphically very close
    agreement with measured natural frequencies was obtained
