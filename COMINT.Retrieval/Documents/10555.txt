cover picture (library at bad neuenahr-ahrweiler). a
    declining readership caused the library at bad
    neuenahr-ahrweiler to close in 1970. in 1975 it was reopened in
    the town hall and permanent accommodation has now been found in
    a restored building of great historic interest to the town.
    readership has expanded from 837 in 1975 to 4,400 in 1981
    (population 28,000). the bookstock of only 4,000 in 1975 had
    risen to over 15,000 by 1979 and further expansion is now
    planned.
