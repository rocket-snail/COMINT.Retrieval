the study of a magnetic inverter for amplification of low
    input power dc signals the principle of operation of the
    magnetic inverter differs from the conventional magnetic
    amplifier in that the load current corresponds to the even
    harmonic mmfs present in the asymmetrically excited iron core
    system power gains up to can be obtained with time constants of
    about sec when operating at the zero stability is within
