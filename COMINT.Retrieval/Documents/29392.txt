the growth of the high frequency electrodeless discharge
    the various stages in the growth of electrodeless discharges
    are discussed in detail with particular consideration of
    electron multiplication processes increase of the number of
    positive ions and the effect of charges on the wall of the
    discharge tube a new experimental technique for measuring the
    discharge current is described in which the large capacitive
    current across the external electrodes is balanced in a bridge
    circuit so that when a discharge occurs the unbalanced voltage
    after amplification and rectification can be used to give a
    proportionate representation of the value of the discharge
    current on a cro for measurement of the growth of the current
    with time hf voltage pulses are applied to the discharge tube
    and the timebase of the cro synchronized with the pulses
    oscillograms show how the growth of current depends on the
    pressure the nature of the gas the excess voltage and the
    frequency of the applied field in the initial stage the
    properties of the tube walls mainly control the multiplication
    process and thus the starting field in the later stages the
    properties of the gas become important and so determine the
    total time of growth of the discharge for previous work see
