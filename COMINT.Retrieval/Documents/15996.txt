some gyrator and impedance inverter circuits the design
    of feedback amplifiers to provide impedance inversion is
    considered negative impedance elements may be included to
    compensate for the residual impedances in the inverter when
    this is done the circuit exhibits gyrator properties
    measurements on a high stability amplifier with a series
    resistance of in the input lead indicated that accurate
    impedance inversion was obtained for load resistances from
    to
