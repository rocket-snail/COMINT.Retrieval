some observations of ionospheric absorption at
    geomagnetic conjugate stations in the auroral zone the boundary
    of the polar cap absorption regin appears to extend to the same
    effective magnetic latitude in the northern and southern
    hemispheres during auroral events the absorption generally
    occurs simultaneously at the nearly magnetically conjugate
    stations of farewell and campbell island
