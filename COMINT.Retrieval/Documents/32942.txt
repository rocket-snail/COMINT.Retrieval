feedback theory some properties of signal flow graphs the
    equations characterizing transmission systems may be
    represented by networks of directed branches termed signal flow
    graphs the branches terminate at nodes which represent repeater
    stations the topology of these diagrams is studied with
    particular reference to feedback circuits the technique is
    illustrated by application to specific circuit design
    problems
