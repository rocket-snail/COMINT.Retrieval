interlibrary lending or document supply in the 1980s.
    examination of the problems of interlibrary loan made it clear
    that the issue libraries in australia are facing is the much
    wider one of document supply. while the interlibrary lending
    procedures which had been established as an expression of
    voluntary cooperation based on goodwill were adequate in the
    1930s and 1940s, they became inadequate in the 1960s and 1970s
    and will bring disaster, if retained, in the 1980s.
