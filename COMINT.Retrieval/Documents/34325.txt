accurate linear bidirectional diode gates discussion of
    switching circuits to be controlled by square wave voltages
    with gates of several milliseconds bridge arrangements of two
    four and six diodes are described operating factors considered
    include amplitude of control voltage gain constancy of gain
    signal characteristic backward leakage through the diodes and
    effects of unbalance series parallel and series parallel
    combinations are illustrated the use of a series parallel
    arrangement of gates for processing radar data is
    described
