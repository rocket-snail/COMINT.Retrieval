the calculation of meteor velocities from continuous wave
    radio diffraction effects from trails meteor velocities are
    calculated from the time interval between cw echo maxima or
    minima neglect of the initial phase relation between echo and
    ground wave introduces large errors an analytical method is
    described and preliminary results are given
