bibliography as a science: from textual criticism to
    bibliometrics. a revised version of a paper presented at a
    brazilian conference in 1975 and 1st published in 1979,
    discussing 20th century developments from the work of pollard
    onwards. reference is made to major publications in the field
    by scholars such as cole, zoltowski, gaskell and levebre. the
    search for bibliographical information is distinguished from
    true bibliographical research, and the establishment of a
    scientific basis for bibliography through statistical analysis
    in bibliometrics is outlined. an account is given of the
    procedures of macrobibliographical analysis, and of the
    development of microbibliographical analysis with the
    introduction of citation indexes. the next advance envisaged is
    the construction of citation chains when a humanities citation
    index becomes available, which may well have major
    repercussions on the history of ideas.
