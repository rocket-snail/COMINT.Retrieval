on the polarization of sources of solar activity on three
    cm wavelength about sixty per cent of the bursts observed were
    polarized the probability of observing a polarized burst being
    greater when the source had a small diameter great bursts
    associated with metre wave bursts of type four have been found
    in most cases to be polarized
