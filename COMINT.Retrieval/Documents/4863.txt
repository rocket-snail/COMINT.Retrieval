cooperation between the libraries of the royal dutch
    academy of science and the technical university of delft' a
    review of activities in the first year. following the
    recommendations of a working party of library representatives
    from the koninklijke nederlandse academie van wetenschappen
    (royal dutch academy of sciences) and the technical university
    of delft in the netherlands in 1979 for closer cooperation
    between the 2 libraries, a formal cooperative agreement was
    made in 1980. regular meetings of staff from both libraries are
    now held to discuss possible areas of cooperation. in both
    libraries consideration of the partner's holdings is taken into
    account before the purchase of new books, periodicals and
    reports. the libraries further cooperate closely in
    interlibrary lending and the provision of computerised
    information retrieval services. in addition both libraries have
    agreed with the european space agency international retrieval
    services to act as a back-up service for libraries in t he
    netherlands in providing copies of articles retrieved in
    computer searches.
