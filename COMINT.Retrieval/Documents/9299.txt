analogue multiplier based on the hall effect discussion
    of the application of the hall effect for electronic
    multiplication of voltages an investigation of semiconductors
    shows si to be the best for accurate multiplication the choice
    of crystal dimensions is discussed with reference to the
    solution of a potential problem with skew boundary conditions
    which determines the hall voltage
