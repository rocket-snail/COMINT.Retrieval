applying game theory to library networks. the application
    of game theory to library networks consists of 4 basic
    subjects' the development of a systematic way to study
    individual coalitions, the calculation of the costs of a
    network, the calculation of the gross benefits for the whole
    network, the stability of the network. concentrates on the 1st
    and last of these subjects. coalitions are compared in a
    systematic way by 1st defining coalitions and introducing the
    concept of a division. the latter is defined as a unique
    combination of coalitions such that every participating library
    is a member of 1 and only 1 coalition and the division exhausts
    all 'n' libraries.
