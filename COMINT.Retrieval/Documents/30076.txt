collection processing as a team effort. describes the
    experiment, carried out at the archives of appalachia, to
    compare the team approach to collection processing with the
    more traditional one. student-workers were employed on
    repetitive processing tasks, including cleaning/flattening and
    treatment for moulds and insect infestation and results showed
    that the experimental collections were processed expeditiously
    without any sacrifice in the quality of either arrangement or
    description and total monthly output from the team was 3 times
    that from a single archivist working alone.
