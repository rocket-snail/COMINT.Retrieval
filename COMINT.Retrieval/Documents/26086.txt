on the scalar diffraction by a circular aperture in an
    infinite plane screen application of variational principles
    reduces the problem of finding the aperture distribution to the
    solution of an infinite system of linear equations an
    investigation is made of a particular system of equations based
    on a convenient expansion of the aperture distribution given by
