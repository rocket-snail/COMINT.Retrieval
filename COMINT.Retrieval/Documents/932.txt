reference services as a teaching function. contribution
    to a thematic issue on library use instruction. reviews some of
    the arguments for and against the idea of a teaching function
    for reference librarians which have been put forward within the
    us library profession. describes the way in which the librarian
    fulfils his teaching role on a 1 to 1 basis at the reference
    desk, and by preparing various kinds of user guides. argues
    that in school and academic libraries the teaching function of
    the librarian must be intensified because of the educational
    objectives inherent in these environments. suggests that with
    decreasing library budgets in the 1980s, librarians, especially
    those in reference services, will be faced with justifying
    their functions and that a suitable way of doing this would be
    for the library to become a 'teaching library'.
