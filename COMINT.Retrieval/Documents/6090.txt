transmission of radio waves through highly ionized gases
    preliminary theoretical discussion of the effect of highly
    ionized media on the transmission of em waves with special
    reference to the possible use of centimetre waves in the study
    of the intense thermal ionization produced in a gas subject to
    high pressure shock waves
