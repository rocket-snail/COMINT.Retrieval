some geomagnetic effects in the equatorial f region o
    observations at ibadan nigeria during show that the midday
    minimum of the maximum concentration of ionization exhibited on
    magnetically quiet days disappears and is replaced by a maximum
    as the degree of magnetic disturbance increases the total ion
    content below the height of maximum ionization varies similarly
    perturbations due to magnetic disturbance have both diurnal and
    semidiurnal components difficulties in the application of
    martyns theory of are discussed and certain modifications are
    suggested
