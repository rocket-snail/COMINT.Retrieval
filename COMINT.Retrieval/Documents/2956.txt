electromagnetic effects in the ionosphere effects of
    crossed constant magnetic and alternating electric fields the
    effect of the crossed fields on the distribution of the
    velocities of the free electrons in an ionized gas is studied
    by means of the general equation of boltzmann collisions
    between electrons being assumed negligible the result obtained
    includes as particular cases those of dryvestyn abstracts and
    of chapman and cowling the mathematical theory of nonuniform
    gases and margenau
