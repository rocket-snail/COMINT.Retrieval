rural library services' the welsh scene. looks at the
    effects of legislation on the development of rural library
    services in wales and the problems of maintaining these
    services for a bilingual community which is very scattered. the
    cost of running such services is high whereas income is low
    because of the lack of industry and thus low rateable values.
    describes the work of the welsh book council, the development
    board for rural wales and the welsh national centre for
    children's literature. the manpower services commission's
    schemes have given welsh rural libraries an opportunity to
    offer employment in order to launch a host of interesting and
    worthwhile schemes.
