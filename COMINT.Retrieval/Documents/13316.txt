the various statements of kirchhoffs principle and their
    application to the diffraction diagrams of electromagnetic
    waves the various approximation methods based on kirchhoffs
    principle are applied to the case of microwave diffraction at a
    diaphragm and a reflector disk particularly for oblique
    incidence comparisons are made with experimental results
    reflection at mirrors with dimensions of the order of a few
    wave lengths is considered with regard to the calculation of
    surface utilization and reflection cross sections
