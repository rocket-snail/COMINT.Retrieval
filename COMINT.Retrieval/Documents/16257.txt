notes on a cause of frequency instability of partially
    plated piezoelectric crystals proximity effect external field
    conditions may have a marked effect on the resonance frequency
    of partially plated crystals movement of an object close to the
    resonator may produce a relative frequency shift of the order
    of or even as an extreme example a shift of about was produced
    by hand effect in a at cut crystal of diameter mm and electrode
    diameter the equivalent resistance simultaneously increasing by
    a quantitative explanation of the effect is given by reference
    to equivalent circuits
