    assesses the impact of technology. factors relevant to the
    design, and criteria for judging the effectiveness of
    interlending systems are presented. current practices are
    summarised and in the light of such information, potential
    basic and combined models are suggested. factors telling
    against efficient national interlending systems are enumerated
