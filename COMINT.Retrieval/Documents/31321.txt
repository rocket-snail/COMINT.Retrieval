the effect of driving electrode shape on the electrical
    properties of piezoelectric crystals formulae are derived for
    the electrical admittance of a piezoelectric crystal in terms
    of its resonant frequencies and static and dynamic capacitances
    the results are applied to the investigation of the effect of
    electrode shape on the resonance spectrum and the capacitance
    ratio of the crystal
