development of the electrical resistance of thin films of
    platinum subjected to a relatively high direct voltage
    measurements made on films of different thicknesses before and
    after the application of voltages of or indicate that the
    resistance is increased decreased or unchanged depending on the
    amount of heat developed which in turn depends on the initial
    resistance and hence on the thickness
