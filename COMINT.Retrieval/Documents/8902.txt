copyright compliance in health sciences libraries' a
    status report two years after the implementation of pl 94-553.
    based on a paper presented at the 80th annual meeting of the us
    medical library association, washington, d.c., june 80. briefly
    reviews developments since the implementation of the new us
    copyright law (pl 94-553) in jan 78 and reports on a us-wide
    survey of academic, hospital, and special health sciences
    libraries. the libraries were asked to report anonymously on
    their current policies and the procedures used to comply with
    the new law. they were also asked to indicate any special
    concerns they have with the law or the guidelines they have
    followed. the results show that, with few exceptions, us health
    sciences libraries are complying with the law and that
    compliance has not significantly affected library
    services.
