a new concept of further training for professional staff
    in public libraries. the scheme, whose text is included, was
    devised by das zentralinstitut fur bibliothekswesen (central
    institute for library science) in 1981. general training on
    cultural and social problems is provided together with various
    types of specialist material and information for management.
    the course includes lectures, discussions and visits to various
    different libraries; use is made of facilities in large central
    organisations and in small branch libraries. the experience
    gained from training courses already available in potsdam and
    erfurt has proved valuable. all professional staff in municipal
    and rural libraries in east germany will have a regular
    training programme; in some areas a training centre has been
    created to serve several libraries.
