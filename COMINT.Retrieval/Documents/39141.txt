good american and english experience with on-line
    searching. examines some publications concerned with the role
    of public libraries in computer searching. describes a 3 year
    project (dialib) in california seeking to investigate the role
    of the public library as a linking agent to commercial data
    bases using the lockheed dialog information retrieval service.
    the service was free for the 1st year only. users were
    university students and researchers, professional people and
    librarians. provides a checklist of points to be observed in
    the planning phase. concludes that on-line services are a
    natural development in public libraries supplementing
    traditional reference services. describes another project
    involving 4 public libraries in england. the planned on-line
    service in lancashire (biros) was to be a service separate from
    the manual reference work. here too, staff was specially
    trained and the public, mainly from educational institutions,
    seemed willing to pay the necessary fees. a set of '
    guidelines' was prepared. finally, discusses atherton and
    christian's' 'librarians and online services', which examines
    how and why libraries make automated search systems available
    and stresses that these systems change the role of the
    reference librarian qualitatively from that of an archivist to
    that of an information specialist.
