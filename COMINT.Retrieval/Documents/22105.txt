automation: a challenge to the social function of the
    library and the social character of the staff?. discusses the
    ideas of cobabus and thiem on the relationship between
    automation and' (1) productivity; (2) product quality; (3)
    staff qualifications and training, and the effects of
    governmental restrictions on expenditure upon these
    relationships. automation in libraries tends to lag behind
    automation in other fields but it demands changes in staff
    training, intellectualisation of production work and a new
    relationship between public and academic libraries. processes
    previously separated can be integrated by automation. before
    automation there was a tendency towards rigidity in the higher
    staff grades; now automation requires changes in the staff
    hierarchy and the old idea of the 'classical librarian'.
