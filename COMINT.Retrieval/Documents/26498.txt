the absorptivity spectrum of a uniform anisotropic plasma
    slab the absorptivity spectrum of a plasma slab is computed for
    waves propagating parallel and normal to an applied static
    magnetic field for various electron densities electron
    collision frequencies and slab thicknesses peaks in the
    absorptivity occur at frequencies near the edges of the stop
    bands within which little energy can enter the plasma because
    of reflection at the first boundary
