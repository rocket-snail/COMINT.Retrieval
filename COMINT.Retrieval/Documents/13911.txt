the rydberg constant and the atomic mass of the electron
    re evaluation of the spectro scopic data pertinent to the
    rydberg constant and the mass of the electron yields the values
    r and atomic mass units from microwave measurements and cm
    houstons and chus data can be brought into agreement with those
    of drinkwater richardson and williams by assuming differences
    in the wavelength standards used
