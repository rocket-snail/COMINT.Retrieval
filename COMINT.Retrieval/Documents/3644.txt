the great either/or debate; or coping with the cultural
    continuum.(p aper presented at the annual gathering of the
    university of rhode island graduate library school 12 apr 80.)
    discussion of popular culture in libraries, reviewing the
    difficulties of defining 'popular culture', and differentiating
    between popular, high and mass culture. the public library
    supports popular culture in trying to meet the needs of people
    at all levels, regardless of background, education and economic
    class, but is in a catch-22 situation of trying to respond at
    all levels, but wherever possible, with the best in each of
    these levels; thus the librarian must still be selective, and
    accordingly reject works which some may still want or
    need.
