a study of the interaction in book selection between
    provincial library systems and their affiliated public
    libraries in south africa. (m.a. thesis). examined current
    methods of book selection in rural, provincial libraries, in
    south africa, with a view to establishing whether they are the
    most effective possible. results showed that relatively little
    change had taken place in the organisational structures of
    these libraries and their book selection methods since their
    inception and that involvement of local librarians in book
    selection was negligible. rural libraries in countries outside
    south africa were reviewed in order to obtain a model against
    which to measure the performance of south african
    libraries.
