examination of the formation of the ionosphere f region
    continuation of work noted in of two different possible
    mechanisms are discussed namely photo ionization of and
    ionization by soft x rays the photoionization hypothesis is
    only acceptable if the dissociation of the is assumed to take
    place at a relatively high altitude of about km ionization by x
    rays of solar origin certainly occurs but a recent calculation
    of the spectral distribution of solar energy indicates too high
    an ionization at km
