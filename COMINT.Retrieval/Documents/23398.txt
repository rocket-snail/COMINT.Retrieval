scattering of a plane wave from a circular dielectric
    cylinder at oblique incidence analysis is presented for the
    general case the solution indicates that the scattering field
    includes a significant cross polarization component which
    vanishes at normal incidence the results are applicable to
    scattering by ionized columns such as meteor trails
