elements of boolean algebra for the study of information
    handling systems terminology symbols definitions and proofs of
    basic theorems of boolean algebra are given as a preliminary to
    the use of this algebra for studying methods of minimizing the
    number of physical elements required on information handling or
    computing systems the method is illustrated by examples of
    design of computer circuits
