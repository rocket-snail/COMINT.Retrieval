the possibility of adjusting the internal impedance and
    varying the gain in amplifiers with combined current and
    voltage feedback the internal impedance can be reduced to and
    maintained at any desired level r inc independent of the gain
    or the amount of feedback by using a fixed amount of the total
    feedback to achieve the impedance reduction and apportioning
    the remainder so that where r and k are the current and voltage
    feedback factors of this remainder three commonly used circuits
    incorporating this feature are discusr attention is devoted to
