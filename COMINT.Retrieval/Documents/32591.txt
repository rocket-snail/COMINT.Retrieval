pre s c polar cap ionospheric black out and typeiv solar
    radio outburst short wave radio blackouts in polar cap regions
    are often found to occur well before the sudden commencement
    magnetic storms and this phenomenon is closely correlated with
    the occurrence of type iv solar bursts a possible explanation
    of these effects is given which is consistent with other
    related phenomena such as cosmic ray storms
