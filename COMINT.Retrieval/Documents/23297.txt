analogous transistor system design and nodal methods of
    construction with applications to research equipment and
    prototype evaluation transistor action and circuits are
    described in terms of the thermionic valve analogy a modular
    technique of circuit construction based on this principle is
    described in which stages are assembled individually using a
    method which simplifies their interconnection
