book presentation. an enquiry into french
    schoolchildren's preferences in layout and typography.
    describes a project to determine children's attitudes to the
    physical qualities of books. over 200 questionnaires were
    completed by children after examining 75 books of all types.
    using this as a basis, a series of group discussions was
    conducted to give a more detailed picture. the results,
    relating to both literary and intellectual content, and
    physical characteristics, are presented graphically. it was
    found that choice was influenced more by aesthetic than by
    literary considerations. as a follow up, a project was devised
    enabling groups of children to compose pages of text
    themselves. an audio-visual presentation on book production for
    school audiences using insights gained from this survey is
    planned.
