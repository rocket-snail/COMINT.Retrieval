note on the design of wide band low noise amplifiers
    methods of reconciling the design requirements for minimum
    noise factor and those for adequate bandwidth are discussed the
    problem can be solved by equalization using either feedback or
    complementary networks some measurements on an experimental
    grounded cathode amplifier with feedback are reported
    satisfactory performance with bandwidths up to about appears
    possible
