the solution of a certain differential equation a method
    of obtaining approximate solutions to a class of nonlinear
    network problems is discussed the method wal developed in
    relation to the problem of a capacitor in series with a
    nonlinear resistor of the type and its application is
    illustrated by reference to this problem the resistor
    characteristic being assumed cubic and the applied voltage
    simple harmonic an exact steady state solution for this network
    is unobtainable but an approximate solution is obtained by
    choosing the constants in the formula for the voltage across
    the resistor such that the applied voltage has no third
    harmonic component
