instrumentation for measuring changes in phase of
    ionospheric echoes changes in carrier phase of ionosphere pulse
    echoes are determined from a comparison of the transmitted
    signal stored by a memory circuit with the echo signal received
    the phase variation is presented in the instrument described on
    a cro and a continuous photographic record is obtained the
    equipment used is similar in principle to that of findlay of
