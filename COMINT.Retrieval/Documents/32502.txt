on the reflection and refraction of hydromagnetic waves
    in ionized gas reflection and refraction of hydromagnetic waves
    at a plane boundary between two semi infinite homogeneous media
    of anisotropic electrical conductivity are considered for the
    case of a steady uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the
    plane difficulties in obtaining solutions when the field is at
    other angles are demonstrated
