recommendations for constructing regional network systems
    and building up regional library centres. recommendations for
    constructing regional network systems and building up regional
    library centres were put forward by the sub-committee on data
    processing in conjunction with the library committee of the
    german research society (deutche forschungsgemeinschaft). they
    underline how necessary and urgent it is to build up regional
    data processing networks for cooperative cataloguing in
    libraries. regional networks provide the optimal means of
    rationalising library work. these networks should not be
    constructed in all 11 federal states but should be built up on
    the existing 7 lending system regions; they would all be
    connected in a national network. regional library centres would
    form the national network and would have the following general
    task areas' cataloguing and acquisition, central editing of
    catalogues etc., data exchange with other central institutes
    and networks, supplying ordered boo ks within the planned
    national order system, developing systems and programmes for
    the software of the regional network, and planning and
    coordination.
