effect f the geomagnetic field on the absorption of short
    waves in the ionosphere vertical incidence an approximate
    formula for the index of refraction is used to calculate the
    coefficient of absorption for five frequencies around the
    results are sensibly the same as those obtained by use of the
    rigorous appleton hartree formula those previously given by
    argence mayot and rawer or of are about higher
