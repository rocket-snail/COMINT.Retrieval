the correlation between decay time and amplitude response
    an investigation is made of the relation between the decay time
    and the delay time of the indicial response and the bandwidth
    and peak values of the steady state amplitude response for
    various minimum phase lumped parameter networks formulae are
    derived expressing the functional relation between decay time
    and the ratio where is the bandwidth at and that at a formula
    for delay time is derived which is valid for multistage
    circuits
