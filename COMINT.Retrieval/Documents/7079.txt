force densities in dielectrics a new approach to the
    theory of electrical conductivity of solids since the
    electrical conductance of a body is a measure of the
    fluctuations of charge in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium
    an analysis of these fluctuations gives the value of the
    conductivity the value derived agrees with that of drude but is
    found to be half that for the lorentz sommerfeld model
