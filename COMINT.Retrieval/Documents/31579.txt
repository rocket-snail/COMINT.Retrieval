library services for africans in the r.s.a. a recent
    policy statement by the south african government opened the way
    for all races to use libraries previously reserved for whites.
    describes library services for africans, covering the
    recommendations of the interdepartmental committee of enquiry
    into library services for non-whites (the de vaal committee,
    reported in 1965); school library services; provision for
    students; public library services in the provinces and national
    states; and the role of national institutions in assisting
    developments. the south african institute for library and
    information science, as a multi-racial body, should devote
    immediate attention to provision of adequate library services
    for all, especially africans.
