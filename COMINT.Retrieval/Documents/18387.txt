teaching about computers and library automation in
    schools of librarianship and information science' a comparative
    survey. beginning with a detailed analysis of 24 published
    surveys and programmes of library and information science
    curricula from 1969-75, discusses the professional continuity
    in changing courses. a particular problem is maintaining the
    identity of 'core studies' in professional curricula. the
    content and objectives of computer courses are listed and
    discussed. the coverage of the author's own survey is
    explained. all 17 schools in the uk, 1 in dublin and 13 in
    eastern usa and canada were visited in 1978 involving
    interviews with over 130 people individually or in groups. 10
    schools overseas provided further data in questionnaires. the
    results of the survey begin by summarising the various stated
    objectives for computer courses. there follows a review of the
    structure of such courses and the views on options in this
    subject. outlining the titles, content, duration and staf fing,
    reviews, with supporting tables, courses for computer
    appreciation, programming and library automation. separate
    tables and commentary cover the data from the questionnaires.
    in the conclusions, it is emphasised that computing is now an
    essential part of professional education, though how much and
    for whom is not yet decided. advanced courses will soon be
    needed for those wishing to specialise.
