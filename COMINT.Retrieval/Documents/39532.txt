popin: an international information network for the
    population field. (note. original presentation in french;
    english version published at author's request.) the
    international population information network (popin) is being
    established in response to the increasing recognition of the
    value of such information, the desire of developing countries
    to build their own information infrastructure, and the need to
    tie together isolated activities to maximise benefits. it is
    developing as a regional and national operation with activities
    integrated through a central coordinating unit. the 1st meeting
    of the popin advisory group (scheduled for early 1980) was to
    discuss ways of improving interconnections among existing
    population information systems; resolve problems of
    standardisation, uniformity, and coordination; and reach a
    consensus on the network's operation.
