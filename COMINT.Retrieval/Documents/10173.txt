bifurcation and other irregularities of the ionospheric f
    layer splitting is considered to occur when the excess of
    energy of each ionizing photon over the ionizing potential is
    transformed into heat on account of the quasi neutrality the
    rarefaction of the gas at the maximum of ionization can create
    a small secondary minimum of electron density which separates
    the f layer into f this secondary minimum of electron density
    appears just at the maximum of electron production
