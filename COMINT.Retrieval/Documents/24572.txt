electrically tuned rc oscillator or amplifier two
    variants are described of a feedback circuit including two all
    pass phase shifting networks tuning is performed by adding a
    variable amount of the output of the one phase shifter to the
    output of the other the variation being controlled
    electronically by means of a modulator circuit theoretically
    the tuning range is from zero to infinite frequency in practice
    the frequency ratio obtainable without appreciable change in
    gain is about
