dissociative recombination in the e layer an examination
    is made of the consequences of assuming that electrons in the e
    layer disappear mainly by dissociative recombination it is
    shown that this assumption provides a far more satisfactory
    basis for explaining actual e layer observtions than ion ion
    recombination and that most of the atomic processes involved
    are amenable to accurate laboratory measurement
