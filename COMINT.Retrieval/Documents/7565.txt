a somewhat unbureaucratic project. describes the
    background to a campaign to reach more readers with quality
    literature initiated by the cultural council. in a memorandum
    of feb 81 it was decided that the campaign should consist of 2
    projects' a regional project, in which new methods should be
    used to stimulate interest in reading and improve the
    distribution of books, and the effects of the methods
    evaluated; and a national information campaign with the object
    of giving information about books, and stimulate interest in
    the regional project. contact with various organisations was
    made, above all the public library commission. in the regional
    project the emphasis was to be on local involvement. the
    project, called the dala project, is to start in the autumn 81
    in the kopparberg region and has 4 cornerstones' schools,
    public libraries, study circles and mass media. the project
    should lead to cooperation and better use of resources, but
    also to suggestions for models for future local library
    services and for the opinion forming role of the cultural
    council.
