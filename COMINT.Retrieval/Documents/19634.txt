library automation in the united states of america.
    covers the past, present and future of library automation in
    the usa. begins with the establishment of networks, describing
    the role of oclc and adoption of marc. the 2nd step is seen as
    the growth of on-line data bases, with particular reference to
    lockheed, sdc and brs. costs, though, have deterred full use of
    these. makes a case for standardisation of formats. the effect
    of on-line systems on retrieval is related to the increasing
    interest in document delivery systems. notes the contribution
    of mini- and microcomputers to this area. centralised shared
    systems have allowed automation to progress. all this needs
    paralleling in the library schools which have difficulty in
    providing the facilities. the real problem lies in making
    systems user friendly. perhaps librarians should cultivate
    self-sufficiency in programming, using easy high-level
    languages like forth and speakeasy. word processors also will
    need to be a standard part of library equipment. the future
    must lie in achieving access to all information from a
    terminal.
