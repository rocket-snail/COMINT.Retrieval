geomagnetic storms and the earths outer atmosphere re
    hydromagnetic oscillations of the ionized outer atmosphere are
    considered theoretically and discussed in relation to
    observations of geomagnetic pulsations the geomagnetic storm on
    february is analysed in terms of hydromagnetic disturbances in
    the outer atmosphere during such storms a corpuscular cavity
    earth radii in size is formed enclosing the earths magnetic
    field a model of the interplanetary space is proposed
