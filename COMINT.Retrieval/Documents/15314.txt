the romanization of cyrillic script. in terms of
    published literature russian language material is 2nd only to
    english language production. however, there is still no
    generally accepted scheme in the western world for converting
    cyrillic characters into roman script. transcription, by which
    cyrillic characters are romanized into phonemes, gives good
    results for pronunciation but leads to a number of alternative
    spellings, whilst transliteration, by which a single roman
    character is substituted for each cyrillic character leads to
    pronunciation difficulties. with the growth in schemes for
    catalogue automation it is essential that a solution is found
    to this problem. research has shown that the iso standard
    offers the best solution although this has unfortunately found
    little favour in the usa and uk.
