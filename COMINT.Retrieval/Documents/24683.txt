infoterra: an international information network.
    infoterra (international referral system for sources of
    environmental information) was established by the united
    nations environment programme as part of earthwatch, its
    programme for the critical assessment of the global
    environment. in operation since jan 77, it has a decentralised
    structure and its national, regional and sectorial focal points
    and the infoterra programme activity centre act as
    switchboards, connecting users with appropriate information
    sources or (if their resources allow) sometimes providing
    information directly to the user. infoterra is not a
    substantive information system and does not provide documents.
    after initial hostility towards the system, developing
    countries are now major participants and infoterra is
    encouraging and helping them to establish their own national
    environmental information systems.
