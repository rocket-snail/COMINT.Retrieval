two new electronic analog multipliers improved types of
    four quadrant multipliers for deriving the product of two time
    functions are described one uses a double amplitude modulation
    scheme applying the work of sternberg and kaufman on the two
    frequency modulation product problem of the other uses
    successive phase modulation and amplitude modulation of a
    carrier the accuracy obtainable is discussed
