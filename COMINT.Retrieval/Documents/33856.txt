regional cooperation' some practical developments. paper
    presented to a meeting of the working party on provincial
    central libraries in deventer, 19 nov 81. in the netherlands
    the cutbacks in local government finances together with the
    growing demand on libraries for technical information have
    encouraged public libraries to cooperate with one another on a
    regional basis to improve the quality and efficiency of their
    services. in addition the expectation that the existing network
    of libraries charged with a regional support function will be
    increased, and the decentralisation of local government
    services as proposed in the new public services act, will
    further encourage this trend. however, where libraries enter
    into schemes of cooperation the needs of their readers should
    remain the prime consideration.
