a new theory of formation of the layer electron pairs
    generated in the upper part of the region diffuse rapidly
    downwards under gravity but at sufficiently low heights they
    are rapidly lost by the mechanism of charge transfer and
    dissociative recombination suggested by bates and massey giving
    rise to a maximum ionization density at a greater height this
    theory gives results in accordance with observations
