euro-american conflicts in the sphere of transborder data
    flow (tdf). the conflicts and possibilities for their solution
    within the area of transborder data flow between the usa and
    the european community are structurally similar to those within
    the area of mass-media between the industrial countries and the
    third world. the author calls for redefinition of the european
    interests and commencement of political autonomy, as well as a
    certain and clearly defined dissociation of europe from the
    usa, comparable to the objectively different interests of
    europe in the national security and energy politics. the
    dissociation from the usa is proposed last but not least in
    order that europe remains credible vis-a-vis the third world in
    the mass-media debate.
