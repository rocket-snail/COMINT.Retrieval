educational centres-a new challenge to libraries.
    describes the educational centre in gentofte, denmark, which
    aims to be for children's institutions (creches, nurseries, day
    and youth centres, etc.) what the resources centres are for
    schools. the centre, opened in aug 80, employs a children's
    librarian with experience of audio-visual materials and an
    instructor. the material consists of 50 subject sets containing
    educational toys, films, slides, and books. film projectors,
    cameras, episcopes and other visual equipment are also lent.
    offset printing is available for use by the institutions. the
    centre arranges workshops involving children and instructors in
    producing films, and theatrical and film shows. urges libraries
    to cooperate in establishment of such centres and make deposits
    of books available.
