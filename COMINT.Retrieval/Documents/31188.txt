standardization of printed circuit materials results of
    tests on metal clad plastic laminates for thermal endurance
    under simulated manufacturing conditions adhesion variation
    between the centre and the edge of the sheet bond strength
    during solder dipping ad hand soldering effects of dust are
    shown graphically these and other types of bond strength tests
    are discussed from the point of view of establishing quality
    standards and standard conditions of test the positioning of
    components to avoid bond stress and the proer choice of
    operating temperatures are also considered
