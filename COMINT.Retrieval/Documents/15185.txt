intelligent access to prestel. the facilities of prestel,
    the uk post office viewdata service, are outlined, emphasising
    the aspects of its design which make it very easy to use. the
    very simple structure of the data is also discussed and
    compared with other viewdata systems. normal prestel terminals
    have limited capabilities but intelligent terminals are being
    developed which will allow telesoftware to be used for program
    distribution. an example of the use of such programs is to
    improve the method of access to specific data. some examples
    are described with emphasis on the need to retain the
    underlying simplicity when adding new capabilities.
