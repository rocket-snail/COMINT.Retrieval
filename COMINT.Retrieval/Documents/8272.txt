the diffraction of galactic radio waves as a method of
    investigating the irregular structure of the ionosphere an
    account of an investigation of ionospheric characteristics by
    observation of changes in the diffraction pattern of radio
    waves from the galaxy ionospheric irregularities cause
    irregular changes of phase in the galactic waves passing
    through them observations at two stations about apart indicate
    that such ionospheric irregularities may have a lateral extent
    of and a variation of electron density of about their height is
    about they are most pronounced about midnight and they show
    little annual variation such portions of the ionosphere have a
    wind like motion with velocities of the order of ms the
    velocities are associated with periods of geomagnetic
    disturbances
