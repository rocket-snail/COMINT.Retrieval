an algorithm for suffix stripping. the automatic removal
    of suffixes is of particular interest in the field of
    information retrieval. an algorithm for suffix stripping is
    described, which has been implemented as a short, fast program
    in bcpl. it effectively works by treating complex suffixes as
    compounds made up of simple suffixes, and removing the simple
    suffixes in a number of steps. in each step the removal of the
    suffix is made to depend upon the form of the remaining stem,
    which usually involves a measure of its syllable length.
