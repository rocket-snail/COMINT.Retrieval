the librarian, informatics, and the interrelation between
    professionals working in libraries today. paper presented at
    the 14th brazilian seminar on informatics and library science,
    sao paulo, 16-23 oct 81. the library of today is described with
    reference to recent organisational and technical innovations,
    within the context of its long history of development. to
    fulfil its responsibilities of collecting, processing and
    disseminating information in the 1980s, the library has become
    increasingly reliant on information analysis; the availability
    of new techniques and technology has freed professionals from
    many traditional tasks and professional training has altered
    greatly in scope and orientation. compares and contrasts the
    roles of the librarian and the information scientist in a
    society like brazil undergoing rapid development, pointing out
    the potential danger in lack of communication between them when
    complementing cooperation is essential to meet economic and
    social needs.
