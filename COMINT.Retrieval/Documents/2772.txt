stability problems with low frequency amplifiers with
    transformers in the feedback path measurements were made of the
    attenuation and phase variation of typical push pull output
    transformers over the frequency band outside the low frequency
    band the phase variation was compared with that of a minimum
    phase rotation network with the same attenuation variation the
    results indicate the possibility of simplifying the stability
    testing of the amplifier circuit by testing the transformer as
    a minimum phase rotation network
