the synergism of user needs, system requirements and
    technological limitations. user perception of data importance
    and the economic feasibility of hardware and storage devices
    will determine the future direction of on-line systems. a
    retrieval system's functions are ultimately dictated by data
    base design. early on-line systems were designed for
    bibliographic information limited to citations only using
    sequential files. now full text information, numeric
    information, and manipulative systems are being perceived by a
    class of users not interested in specialised vocabulary skills.
    these users are placing demands that will require sophisticated
    internal technology, improved and expanded storage capability,
    more sophisticated file structure, and transparent data
    manipulative devices. the economic potential of these demands
    will bring about the development of a new generation of
    multitiered data bases that allow users at all skill levels to
    approach them. the point is that, as the user's need for types
    of data to be retrieved changes, so must the data base
    technology change. report not available from ntis.
