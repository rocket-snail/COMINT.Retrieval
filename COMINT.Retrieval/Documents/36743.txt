energy distribution of secondary electrons from magnesium
    and berylium alloys experiments were carried out at a pressure
    of mm hg with alloys and activated by heating either in a
    vacuum or in an atmosphere of oxygen curves showing the
    dependence of the secondary emission coefficient on the energy
    of primary electrons and of the secondary current on the
    voltage at the collector are plotted the mechanism of secondary
    emission from complex surfaces is not considered to be similar
    to that of the malter effect the role of the accelerating field
    is probably reduced here to the compensation of local retarding
    fields above the inhomogeneous surface of the activated
    layer
