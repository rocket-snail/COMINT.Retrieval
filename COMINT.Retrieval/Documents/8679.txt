the interpretation and synthesis of certain spread f
    configurations appearing on equatorial ionograms computer ray
    tracing to thin irregularities in the equatorial ionosphere
    explains three classes of spread f from synthesized ionograms
    it is possible to deduce the position size and drift velocities
    of patches of irregularities
