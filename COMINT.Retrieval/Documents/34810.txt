some not necessarily linear poles composed of linear
    poles and in some other poles linear relations exist between
    the voltages and the currents and the resulting impedance
    matrix is symmetrical a generalization to include nonlinear
    relations is given by the condition that must be symmetrical in
    and where is the pd between the and the zeroth terminal and is
    the current flowing into the terminal examples and properties
    of such poles are given
