differential amplifier design the possibility is
    discussed of providing good rejection of in phase signals
    without using a balancing adjustment or specially selected
    components to achieve the desired result by use of in phase
    negative feedback care must be taken that the feedback and
    input voltages are correctly combined two circuits combined two
    circuits are described illustrating the principles v involved
    both have the disadvantage of requiring floating batteries and
    isolated heater supplies
