library stock as a system of partial bookstocks. in a
    particular library the bookstock is a heterogenous entity which
    consists of materials in different subjects and languages, with
    different chronological and regional connotations which serve a
    broad spectrum of readers. thus, the available bookstock
    naturally subdivides into a number of entities which belong to
    the same category and the subject matter appears to be the most
    important criterion. large libraries in slovakia e.g.
    university libraries have specific reading rooms for partial
    bookstock e.g. natural sciences or librarianship. special
    partial bookstock may consist of internal publications such as
    theses, research reports, internal translations and others. in
    dealing with partial bookstock it is important to establish the
    type of reader using it (e.g. children), the physical form of
    the stock (traditional or micro), geographical relevance and
    the frequency of its usage. the differential aspect of
    bookstock is well worth bearing i n mind for the most effective
    way of utilising library resources.
