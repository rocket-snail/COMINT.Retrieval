reciprocal ladder networks the transfer impedance of a
    system comprising generator and load with ladder network
    interposed is unchanged if instead of the original network a
    reciprocal network is connected in reverse the reciprocal
    network is derived from the original one by replacing series
    impedances by shunt impedance and vice versa the product of the
    original and new impedances being in each case equal to the
    product of the generator and load impedances
