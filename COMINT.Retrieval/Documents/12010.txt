sone effects in inductively coupled electrodeless high
    frequency gas discharges with super posed magnetic field the
    effects noted by lindberg were further investigated the
    resonance effect appears to be due to electrons moving
    initially in circular orbits coaxial with the tube wall rapidly
    acquiring energy in the alternating field an application fo the
    effect in a ion source is briefly described for another
    application
