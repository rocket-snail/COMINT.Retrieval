on-line search experience on the subject of the texture
    of zirconium alloys. the technical information service of the
    metallgesellschaft ag (metal association company),
    frankfurt-am-main, noted that many on-line searchers required
    information from 2 or more data bases since the information
    overlap between different bases is narrow. an investigation was
    made concerning search term frequencies in material on
    zirconium alloys and concerning the information potential of
    various data bases between 1972-78 and 1964-71; results are
    described in detail. economic aspects of data processing must
    be watched; more simplification, unity and accuracy are needed.
    the many national data stores on science and technology should
    be amalgamated into 1 well-organised data bank, since modern
    technology is becoming more and more multidisciplinary.
