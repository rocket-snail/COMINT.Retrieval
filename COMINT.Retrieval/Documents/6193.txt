a ferrite frequency modulator the modulator described
    comprises a ferroxcube ring carrying a rf winding and located
    in the gap of a ni fe core carrying lf and polarizing windings
    it is suitable for operation over the frequency range from to
    uhf with slight modifications its demodulated distortion is at
    an oscillator frequency of and a frequency deviation and at and
    respectively
