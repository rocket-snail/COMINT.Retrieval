exchange as a traditional method of acquisition for
    national libraries. (ma dissertation.) analyses the main issues
    and concepts that should be considered by the library
    profession in countries without a tradition of international
    exchanges of official publications and documents. defines these
    terms and examines the unesco special convention on the
    subject. examines different organisation patterns arising from
    interchange of duplicates and notes the 2 arrangements best
    suited for nationwide operation (the collecting depot and the
    central bureau). taking these factors into consideration, makes
    recommendations for the new instituto autonomo biblioteca
    nacional y de servicias de bibliotecas in venezuela (which
    absorbed the biblioteca nacional in 1977) and the consejo
    nacional de investigaciones cientificas y tecnologicas
    (conicit).
