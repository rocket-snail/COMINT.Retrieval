the observed outer belt electron distribution and the
    neutron decay hypothesis the electron flux distribution along a
    line of force of range in the equatorial plane is compared with
    a curve based on the neutron albedo theory of electron
    production there is sufficient disparity between the two curves
    to suggest that other sources of electrons must exist
