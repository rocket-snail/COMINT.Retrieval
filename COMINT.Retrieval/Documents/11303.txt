transistor convert sine waves to pulses a circuit using
    eight point contact transistors to amplify limit and
    differentiate a sine wave input is described the power supply
    unit uses junction diodes the frequency range is minimum input
    is pulse output maximum pulse rise time pulse width adjustable
    from to and output impedance of
