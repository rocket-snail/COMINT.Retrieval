the israel legal deposit law (in hebrew). in 1953 the
    law, originally promulgated by the british mandatory
    government, was amended. as it now stands, publishers must
    deposit 5 copies of each new book within 1 month, as follows' 1
    to the ministry of education and culture, 1 in the israel state
    archives, 1 in the knesset library and 2 in the jewish national
    and university library (jnul). the present law does not cover
    non-book material; editions are not strictly defined; there is
    no way to prove delinquency in deposit of books during the
    statutory period of 1 month; the fines are not high enough to
    deter publishers; and the procedures for instigating legal
    action are in themselves a deterrent against such action.
    outlines the steps taken by the jnul to encourage publishers to
    comply with the law, in order to ensure that as many books as
    possible are deposited until the law can be amended.
