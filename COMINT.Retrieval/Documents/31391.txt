new filter theory of periodic structures theory for
    linear passive quadripoles is developed in terms of
    characteristic reflection and transmission factors which can be
    specified by references to the standing wave pattern on lines
    connected to the input and output the relations between these
    factors and the usual circuit constants particularly the image
    function of symmetrical circuits are studied the method is
    illustrated by examining multisection structures combining
    quadripoles and loss free lines the uses of these
    characteristic factors leads to major simplifications in
    dealing with loss free structures where most of the work can be
    done graphically
