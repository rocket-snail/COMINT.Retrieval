photoelectric emission in the extreme ultra violet
    results of experimental studies on photoelectric emission from
    various metals for quantum energies up to cannot even
    qualitatively be ac ounted for by the common free electron
    surface effect representation a new theoretical model capable
    of explaining the observations at high photon energies is
    presented
