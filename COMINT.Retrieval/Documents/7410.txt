new petred of solution for unretarded satellite orbits an
    axially symmetric solution of laplaces equation in oblate
    spheroidal coordinates is found which may be used as the
    gravitational potential about an oblate planet this potential
    which makes the hamilton jacobi equation for a satellite orbit
    separable has an expansion in zonal harmonics in which the
    amplitudes of the zeroth and second harmonics can be adjusted
    to agree exactly with the values for any axially symmetric
    planet and a fourth harmonic which then agrees approximately
    with the latest value for that of the earth
