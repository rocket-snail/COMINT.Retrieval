some numerical experiments using newton's method for
    nonlinear parabolic and ellipticboundary-value problems using a
    generalization of newton's method, a nonlinear parabolic
    equation of the form u(t)-u(xx)=g(u) and a nonlinear elliptic
    equation u(xx)+u(yy)=exp(u) are solved numerically comparison
    of these results with results obtained using the picard
    iteration procedure show that in many cases the quisi
    linearization method offers substantial advantages in both time
    and accuracy. april, 1961 bellman, r. juncosa, m. l. kalaba, r.
