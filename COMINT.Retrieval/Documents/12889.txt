geomagnetic and geoelectric variations analysis of
    records of geomagnetic pulsations especially those with periods
    of sec indicates that they may be associated with ionospheric
    vibrations caused by a disturbance of the ionization
    equilibrium information regarding the distribution of ground
    conductivity is obtained from the relation between the magnetic
    pulsations and the associated transverse electric field
    pulsations
