on the problem of starting conditions of the avalanche
    process in relaxation oscillators on poinoscillators on point
    contact triodes it is shown that the oscillators can be
    considered as nonlinear voltage or current amplifiers
    conditions governing the formation of the avalanche process are
    given and fomulae are derived for coefficients of voltage and
    current amplification circuits are shown
