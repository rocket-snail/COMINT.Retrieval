the ionosphere over halley bay the ionospheric phenomena
    observed at halley bay are briefly described and the influence
    of the weddell sea magnetic dip anomaly stressed some
    ionization is generated in the lower ionosphere by solar
    photoionization processes at solar zenith angles up to about
    the f layer variations appear to be dominated by movements of
    ionization which can also be seen near the maximum of the f
    layer ionization drift velocities in the e region reverse with
    season and are greater in winter than in summer other features
    of drift and absorption are generally consistent with those
    expected
