libraries and documentation centres in secondary
    teaching. results of recent american and canadian research.
    extract from a project for a thesis in education sciences
    prepared for the university of montreal. american theses from
    1976-77 to 1980-81 on secondary school libraries have focussed
    on the topics of media programmes, personnel, and use, whereas
    in quebec interest has been concentrated chiefly on use. the
    results of research on use are summarised, and the situation in
    the usa in general compared with quebec. quebec shows little
    change, and is far from moving towards the american conception
    of the library as central to all teaching. further research is
    proposed to establish the reasons for this developing
    crisis.
