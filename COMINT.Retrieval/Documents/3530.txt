high frequency transistor polyphase oscillator conditions
    for oscillation of a polyphase transistor oscillator are
    developed from its valve equivalent of march experimental
    results show the relative performances of single polyphase and
    push pull transistor oscillators and demonstrate the
    superiority of the polyphase oscillator when a high power
    output is required at high frequencies
