the gene-tox program: genetic activity evaluation. the
    gene-tox program, a 2-phase evaluation from the existing
    literature of selected bioassays for detecting mutagenicity and
    presumptive carcinogenicity, is described. sponsored and
    directed by the office of testing and evaluation within the us
    environmental protection agency's (epa) office of pesticides
    and toxic substances, this program will aid epa in establishing
    standard genetic testing and evaluation procedures for the
    regulation of toxic substances and determining the direction of
    research and development in the area of genetic
    toxicology.
