pseudo rectification and detection by simple e bilateral
    nonlinear resistors an analysis of ac dc converting circuits
    using symmetrical nonlinear resistors the operation of which
    may be largely independent of temperature two applications are
    described for developing the hv focusing potential bias for a
    picture tube and for improving the detection threshold of a
    photoelectric sensing device
