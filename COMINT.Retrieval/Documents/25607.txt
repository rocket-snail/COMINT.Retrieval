kinetic theory of weakly ionized homogeneous plasmas part
    a rigorous method is presented for integrating boltzmanns
    equation by successive approximations for a weakly ionized gas
    subjected to an alternating electric field and a static
    magnetic field the electron velocity distribution function is
    developed with respect to the electric field and the individual
    functions obtained are developed as spherical functions the
    method is applied to investigation of a lorentz type gas
