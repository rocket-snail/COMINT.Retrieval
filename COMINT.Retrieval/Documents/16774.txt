automated interlibrary loans. ben an sssr, (ussr academy
    of sciences natural sciences library), (asns), uses for
    interlibrary loans the natural sciences stock of 50 moscow
    learned libraries; this necessitated an automated process. asns
    has automated its service controlling the flow of requests,
    their processing, and overdues. a computer provides information
    on the progress of loan requests and statistical data on
    interlibrary loans. a special triplicate order form permits the
    introduction of information into the computer without
    pre-machine processing. a machine calendar scans loan periods.
    owing to computerisation asns has eliminated 2 card indexes
    recording interlibrary loans, (60,000 cards p.a.), and freed
    staff for other work. asns plans to introduce automation into
    other sections.
