academic librarians in colleges of further and higher
    education. argues that, as a generalisation, librarians who
    regard themselves as acting within an educational environment
    behave rather differently from those who stress their
    librarianship functions and that these differences are related
    to academic status. the award of academic status encourages the
    former by attracting and retaining those willing to adopt an
    extended educational role. academic rank also elicits the
    internalisation, or self-ascription, by the librarian of
    educational roles.
