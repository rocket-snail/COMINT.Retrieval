generation of rosary permutations expressed in
    hamiltonian circuits systematic generation of a specific class
    of permutations fundamental to scheduling problems is
    described. in a nonoriented complete graph with n vertices,
    hamitonian circuits equivalent to .5(n - 1)! specific
    permutations of n elements, termed rosary permutations, can be
    defined. each of them corresponds to two circular permutations
    which mirror-image each other, and is generated successively by
    a number system covering 3*4*...*(n-1) sets of edges. every set
    of edges {e[k]}, 1 <= e[k] <= k, 3 <= k <= (n-1) is
    determined recursively by constructing a hamiltonian circuit
    with k vertices from a hamiltonian circuit with k-1 vertices,
    starting with the hamiltonian circuit of 3 vertices. the basic
    operation consists of transposition of a pair of adjacent
    vertices where the position of the pair in the permutation is
    determined by {e[k]}. two algorithms treating the same example
    for five vertices are presented. it is very easy to derive all
    possible n! permutations from the .5(n - 1 )! rosary
    permutations be cycling the permutations and by taking them in
    the reverse order-procedures which can be performed fairly
    efficiently by computer. june, 1971 harada, k. permutation,
