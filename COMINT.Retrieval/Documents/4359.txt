the stability of a homopolar dynamo the stability of the
    self exciting disk dynamo is considered taking into account the
    friction at the axle and the effect of an external electrical
    load in parallel with the field coils possible analogies
    between the results obtained and the motion of an electrically
    conducting fluid in a magnetic field are discussed the theory
    may be useful in explaining the magnetic field of the earth and
    of sunspots
