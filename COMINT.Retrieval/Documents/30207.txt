a statistical study of world whde occurrence probability
    of spread f parts one and two diurnal seasonal and latitudinal
    variations in the occurrence of spread f during the i g y are
    analysed marked differences between high and low latitudes
    suggest an essentially different origin for the phenomenon in
    the two regions the correlation of spread f with geomagnetic
    activity is discussed and abnormal occurrences during magnetic
    storms are examined in detail
