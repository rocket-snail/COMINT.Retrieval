determination of position on the earth from a single
    visual observation of an artificial satellite if a reliable
    orbit is available and an observation of the satellite against
    a background of of stars can be made to an accuracy within and
    timed to the position of the observer can be determined with
    sufficient accuracy for navigation purposes a single visual
    observation of echo provides the reference in a worked
