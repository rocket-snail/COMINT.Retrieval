mechanisms of creation of i nospheric inhomogeneities
    results of approximate calculations indicate that a negative
    temperature gradient of about deg cm or greater at a height of
    about could result in thermal convection current such as would
    produce inhomogeneities and high velocity winds in the
    ionosphere the temperature at km is assumed to be about
