make libraries accessible to all!. 6 years after the
    government agreed on a new cultural policy, no proposals for
    such a policy on the needs of the handicapped exist. despite
    our concern for freedom of expression, many handicapped are
    denied access to the spoken and printed word. libraries have an
    obligation to make their cultural activities available to all.
    direct physical accessibility means that the handicapped can
    reach the library, enter it and stay there. but improved
    buildings and transport cannot replace the domiciliary library
    service. indirect accessibility means that library activities
    and media must be adapted to reach new groups. 'easy readers'
    are an example of such a medium and their publication and
    distribution through libraries are discussed. the new state
    library for speech and braille printing is the 1st stage in
    provision for the blind and partially-sighted; the next is the
    increased distribution of such material to other groups.
