training without education: a lost cause. formal and
    ongoing training of computer searchers is fundamental to the
    success of any computerised information service. argues that
    all library staff should be educated in the use of computers
    for reference work so that computer searching can be fully
    integrated into the normal everyday service. libraries must not
    feel that they have failed if they decide to ask for a computer
    search rather than hunt through books for themselves. briefly
    discusses the advantages of on-line access to reference books
    and indexes to popular periodicals and newspapers.
