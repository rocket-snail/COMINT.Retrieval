theory of maximally flat and quasi tchebycheff filters
    the synthesis of a quadripole with a prescribed attenuation
    function is described this function has to satisfy certain
    conditions the synthesis s is carried out for maximally flat
    and quasi tchebycheff low pass filters the results being
    presented in curves suitable for calculating the values of the
    circuit components the treatment is extended to band pass
    filters by means of a well known frequency
    transformation
