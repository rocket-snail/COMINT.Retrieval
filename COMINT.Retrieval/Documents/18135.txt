how analogue networks solve air conditioning problems the
    thermal properties of a unit area of the structural elements
    are represented by an equivalent electrical circuit a complelt
    block diagram shows how these are used to simulate the thermal
    behaviour of a room and its air conditioning system some
    detailed circuitry is given
