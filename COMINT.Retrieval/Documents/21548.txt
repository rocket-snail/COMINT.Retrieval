two anomalies in the behaviour of the f layer of the
    ionosphere report of a study of electron density data at a
    number of widely distributed observatories during equinox in a
    year of high sunspot activity results show that the geomagnetic
    anomaly described by appleton extends much farther from the
    magnetic equator as lower heights are investigated a diurnal
    asymmetry also exists with forenoon electron densities greater
    than corresponding afternoon ones
