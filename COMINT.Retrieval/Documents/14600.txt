simultaneous partial absorption reflection and
    transmission of a uniform plane wave by a thin metal layer
    simple analysis is used to derive expressions for the energy
    reflected transmitted and absorbed for a normally incident wave
    for given conductivity the absorbed energy has a maximum value
    of half the incident energy at a particular value of thickness
    the reflected and transmitted energies being then equal
