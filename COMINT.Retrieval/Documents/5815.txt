ionosphere electron density measurements with the navy
    aerobee hi rocket electron densities were measured at heights
    between km and above new mexico by the doppler shift method in
    which the beat note between a signal and a reference signal at
    was recorded the results corrected for obliquity effects
    confirm the general structure of the ionosphere previously
    measured and are consistent with simultaneous records the
    ionosphere remains dense between e and f regions sporadic e was
    associated with a sharp spike in the distribution at
    approximately km thick
