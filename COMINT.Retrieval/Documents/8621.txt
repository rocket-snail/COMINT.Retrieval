correlation of amplitude and phase fluctuations in wave
    propagation in a medium with random inhomogeneities the two
    problems noted in of april are treated more fully the value of
    the correlation coefficient r between amplitude and phase
    fluctuations at the receiving point is given by equation and
    reduces to for small distances and to in for large distances
    where is given by where and is the dimension of the
    inhomogeneities the autocorrelation coefficient for amplitude
    fluctuations o at points and is plotted as a function of in
    curve that of phase fluctuations in curve the curves refer to
    the case when d and lies between and
