talking to the television. brighton polytechnic (in
    collaboration with itv and bbc) is conducting a project to
    study the educational implications of teletext. 10 suitable
    television sets will be placed in schools, teaching materials
    will be produced for them and their use will be monitored. the
    bbc's ceefax, itv's oracle and the gpo's prestel form the basis
    for the experiment, but it is felt that these have shown
    certain limitations for educational use in the past. a new
    development, telesoftware, could overcome such limitations.
    telesoftware allows the user to 'talk' to the television set,
    pages of information become instantly available, some pages can
    carry instructions, and specific programmes for microcomputer
    use may be received.
