libraries, radio and television in work with young
    people. there are 3 main ways in which libraries and the media
    can cooperate. radio and television can broadcast relevant
    programmes such as discussions, interviews with authors and
    story readings. librarians can use television and radio to
    focus the attention of young people on particular issues,
    recommending programmes and linking book displays to them.
    alternatively, librarians can be actually involved in the
    production of programmes and can use them to publicise popular
    literature and authors. a survey, undertaken in rostov, showed
    how effective this form of cooperation could be, but it is
    often difficult to achieve.
