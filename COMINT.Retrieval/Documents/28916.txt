vacuum fluctuation noise the possibility of observing
    vacuum fluctuations by measuring the resultant electron stream
    noise when an electron stream interacts with a damped
    oscillator is discussed an electron stream i shown to provide a
    means of precise measurement of the mean square noise emf for
    certain modes the circuit must be at low temperature
