sdi in an academic community. a 6-month experimental sdi
    service was undertaken at the university of natal library,
    pietermaritzburg south africa, as part of a plan to make
    subject librarians more service orientated, and in the
    knowledge that research time for academics was at a premium. a
    methodology was devised and 21 lecturers from across the
    academic spectrum submitted 27 profiles. references were
    supplied from journals and monographs and from abstracting
    tools where the library had poor literature coverage. at the
    end of the 6 months, feedback revealed that 93% of the
    references assessed (82%) were relevant or apparently relevant,
    showing that bibliographic rather than terminological skills
    were the salient factor. academic response was unanimously in
    favour of a continuation of the service, while a few
    respondents wanted minor improvements. the subject librarians
    found that the service increased job satisfaction and allowed
    them to look more critically at library stock. in terms of time
    and financial cost the sdi service was easily absorbed into the
    existing work structure of the library. it was found to be
    particularly relevant to interdisciplinary research, and it
    relied upon a well-developed subject librarian structure. its
    success, however, depended on an active campaign by librarians
    directed at potential participants.
