thermal radio emission from the sun and the source of
    coronal heating a statistical analysis is made of data obtained
    from measurements of solar radiation at frequencies between and
    th total radiation is separated into a component associated
    with sunspots and a basic component showing no such connection
    results indicate that sunspot radiation and the very hot
    regions responsible for it diminish loss rapidly than the spot
    area and exist for a month or more after the spot has vanished
    the basic component at some frequencies is much lower than
    previously believed s regions above the sunspots are the source
    of coronal energy and gases spreading from them can completely
    replace the corona in about four days
