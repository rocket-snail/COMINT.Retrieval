dynamic phenomena in the ionosphere records of f layer
    height obtained with the rapid sweep sounder at freiburg show
    trace detail indicative of transient ionospheric variations
    various types of deformation of the trace are noted these short
    lived disturbances are nearly always propagated from a high
