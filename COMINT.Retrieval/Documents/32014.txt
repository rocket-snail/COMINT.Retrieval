magnetic demodulation with sinusoidal variation of the
    induction flux with magnetic demodulation using sinusoidal
    current in the demodulating reactor the flux is distorted by
    arranging instead for the flux to be sinusoidal the power can
    be increased analysis is given based on analogy with diode
    theory the flux being treated as the equivalent of the voltage
    across the diode essential differences between magnetic and
    diode demodulators are discussed
