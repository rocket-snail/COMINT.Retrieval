quantum theory of spatial dispersion of electric and
    magnetic susceptibilities electromagnetic effects in a
    homogeneous medium can be described in terms of a conductivity
    dependent on frequency and wave vector and a susceptibility
    dependent only on the wave vector a universal relation between
    conductivity and susceptibility is derived
