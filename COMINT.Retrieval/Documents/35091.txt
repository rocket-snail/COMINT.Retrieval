waveform computations by the time series method the time
    series method greatly reduces the work of computation in the
    solution of waveform or transient response problems of cascade
    connected linear quadripoles practical procedures for dealing
    with time series are described and illustrated by numerical
    calculations relating to waveform tests on a mile coaxial cable
