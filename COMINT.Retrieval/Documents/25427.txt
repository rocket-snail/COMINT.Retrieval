molecular microwave oscillator and new hyper fine
    structure in the microwave spectrum of an experimental
    arrangement which can be used as a high resolution microwave
    spectrometer a microwave amplifier or a stable oscillator
    consists of a focused beam of molecules directed into a high
    oscillating cavity within which the molecules give up energy an
    emission line is seen when the excitation frequency of the
    cavity is varied through the molecular transition
