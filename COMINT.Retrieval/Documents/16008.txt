hospital library resources in massachusetts' data
    collection and analysis. massachusetts hospitals were surveyed
    to establish some ranges and base line statistics for hospital
    medical information resources. data were evaluated in terms of
    theoretical compliance with the joint commission on
    accreditation of hospitals standards as well as the more
    specific proposed appendices to the canadian standards for
    hospital libraries. the study quantifies hospital library
    resources and services in a state with a substantial number of
    acute care facilities. 67.6% of those studies were judged as
    meeting either the revised jcah or the canadian criteria. the
    central finding is that the 100- to 299-bed hospitals reflect a
    significant number of deficiencies when evaluated against
    either quantitative or nonquantitative standards. suggests
    further areas of study.
