algorithms for finding a fundamental set of cycles for an
    undirected linear graph given the adjacency matrix of the
    graph, the algorithm presented in this paper finds a spanning
    tree and then constructs the set of fundamental cycles. our
    algorithm is slower than an algorithm presented by welch by a
    ratio of n/3 (n is the number of nodes) but requires less
    storage. for graphs with a large number of nodes and edges,
    when storage is limited our algorithm is superior to welch's;
    however, when the graphs are small, or machine storage is very
    large, welch's algorithm is superior. timing estimates and
    storage requirements for both methods are presented. december,
