the analysis of rocket experiments in terms of electron
    density distributions the relative delay o of a pulsed signal
    as a function of rocket position is used to deduce the electron
    density distribution to heights of about km the data are
    analysed for ascent and descent at frequencies of and peaks are
    shown at and and an intense irregularity on ascent at km good
    agreement with a simultaneous record is obtained
