the policies and strategies of quebec publishers. based
    on a thesis for the master's degree in sociology. the marketing
    and publishing strategies of quebec french language publishers
    in 1960-77 are analysed, using the results of a 1978 survey, in
    terms of publishing policies. results show a shift from
    religious to ideological publishing; a continuing distinction
    between 'cultural' and 'practical' books: and a largely
    unstructured industry.
