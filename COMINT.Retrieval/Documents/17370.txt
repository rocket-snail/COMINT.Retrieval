on diffraction by a strip limitations of the integral
    equation and fourier lame methods of dealing with the problem
    of diffraction by a strip or slit are discussed the variational
    technique of levine and schwinger of can b used to obtain an
    approximate value of the far zone field in a form which is
    stationary with respect to small variations about is true value
    of the current induced in the strip a calculation using this
    representation and assuming as a rough approximation as a rough
    approximation a uniform density distribution of current in the
    strip gives a good approximation to the value of the far zone
    field the scattering cross section is then found by using the
    scattering theorem of papas
