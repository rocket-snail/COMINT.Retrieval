a simplifying technique in the solution of a class of
    diffraction problems considerable simplification of the
    treatment of diffraction problems leading to wiener hopf
    integral equations results from taking the transform before
    applying the boundary conditions this is demonstrated by
    consideration of the sommerfeld problem for the semi infinite
    plane the diffraction of small amplitude sound waves by a semi
    infinite rigid cylinder the diffraction of a plane em wave by a
    finite waveguide a vector field
