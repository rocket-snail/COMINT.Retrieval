impact of other disciplines on information retrieval and
    librarianship. the central focus of this research was to
    analyse the impact of ideas originating from within
    librarianship and information retrieval and those from other
    disciplines. 12 most cited journals in librarianship and
    information retrieval (source specialties) were chosen for
    citation analysis. from these journals, 40 articles were
    randomly selected from the last complete year and their
    references recorded, resulting in 1,159 citations. the analysis
    consisted of measurements of self-citation, cross-fertilisation
    (proportion of citations made by one to the other source
    specialty), and openness (the degree to which a specialty is
    open to the ideas of other disciplines). report not available
