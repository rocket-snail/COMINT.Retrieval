electromagnetic waves in hollow metal cylinders with
    circular cross section the object of the paper is to coordinate
    the treatment of the subject and to clarify some points the
    electric and magnetic lines of force are mapped in perspective
    other diagrams show the distribution of poynting vector over
    the cross section and the currents in the walls wave
    propagation in concentric lines is investigated
