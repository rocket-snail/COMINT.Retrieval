scattering of waves by a statistically irregular surface
    a method is proposed for calculating the field of plane waves
    scattered by a perfectly reflecting statistically irregular
    surface the irregularities being large in comparison with the
    wave length the method can be used for acoustic as well as
    electromagnetic waves
