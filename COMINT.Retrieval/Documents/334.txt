a personal view of the zambia library service. personal
    view of the service, based on observations made during work
    under the voluntary services overseas scheme. in kasama, the
    provincial centre of the northern province, 3 major problems
    faced library services-poor transport; the legacy left by an
    acting librarian who had operated his own kind of library
    service which was extremely confused ; and the lack of
    provision for the practical training of newly qualified staff.
    improvements need to be made to the system in terms of
    authority, development, transport, training, professional
    status and promotional activities.
