vip manual' guidelines and procedures for eric vocabulary
    improvement. this manual was developed for use by eric
    personnel involved in the 2 1/2 year vocabulary improvement
    project (vip) which culminated in the publication of the 1980
    completely revised edition of the thesaurus of eric descritors.
    based on the idea that indexing is not about description of
    documents but about retrieval, it applies criteria derived from
    the capabilities of manual and on-line retrieval to examples of
    thesaural problems. project procedures and principles for
    vocabulary improvement are presented in the first 2 sections,
    followed by detailed discussions of the functions and treatment
    of main terms, scope notes, and use/use for references. report
