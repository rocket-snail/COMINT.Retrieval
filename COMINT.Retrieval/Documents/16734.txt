action of periodic telegraphy signals on cascaded rlc
    resonant circuits the response to rectangular trapezoidal and
    sine squared pulses of a cascaded arrangement of up to three
    similar tuned circuits is investigated theoretically and the
    results compared with the response of a single tuned circuit of
    the effect of a bandwidth and signal repetition frequency is
    studied from the point of view of using the circuit for fourier
    analysis and for reception of telegraphy
