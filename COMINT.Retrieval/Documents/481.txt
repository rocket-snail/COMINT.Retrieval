some results obtained by measuring the magnetic field at
    the earth with a space rocket results obtained using
    magnetometers with a range of and a telemetry channel
    sensitivity of v where oersted indicate that at a distance of
    earth radii the magnetic field does not depend only on the
    earthpotential but also on external sources such as charged
    solar particles measured values recorded by space rocket are
    lower than calculated ones the difference between these values
    reaches a maximum at km and a minimum at km
