issues in school librarianship in britain: a canadian
    perspective. presents impressions gained by a canadian during a
    2-week british council study tour of uk school libraries in apr
    80 and compares the uk and canadian scenarios. the school
    librarian is a librarian 1st in the uk, a teacher 1st in
    canada. uk school librarians spend precious time selecting and
    cataloguing materials; canadians rely on selection aids and
    spend time on in-service programmes designed to give ideas on
    use of material. professional politics in the uk are
    destructive. the next decade will be decisive for uk school
    librarians who must define their goals and decide whether they
    are part of education or the public library.
