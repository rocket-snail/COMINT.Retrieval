cosmic ray intensity variations during two solar cycles
    from ionization chamber data the decrease of cosmic ray
    intensity from its maxima near sunspot minima is shown to lag a
    year or more behind the increase of solar activity following
    sunspot minima the variability of daily mean values was
    particularly great in
