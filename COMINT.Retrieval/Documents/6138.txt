the linear distortion of fm signals in band pass filters
    for large modulation frequencies the linear distortion of a fm
    signal in a highly selective band pass filter follows almost
    exactly the static response curve of the network provided the
    following conditions are fulfilled the modulation frequency is
    not less than two thirds of the semi bandwidth the modulation
    index does not exceed unity the network q is sufficiently
    large
