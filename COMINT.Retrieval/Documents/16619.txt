action of an unlimited train of telegraphic signals on a
    resonant rlc circuit the response of a series rlc circuit to a
    train of pulse signals is considered for three types of pulse
    rectangular symmetrical trapezoidal and of sine squared form
    analysis shows that in the steady state whatever the degree of
    mistuning of the circuit with respect to the signal hf the
    amplitude of the current varies continually with time the
    variations are due partly to energy dissipation during the
    intervals between the signals and partly to beating of the
    forced oscillations due to the signals with the natural
    oscillations of the circuit the latter effect is particularly
    noticeable in a very selective circuit but its magnitude is
    largely dependent on the degree of mistuning of the circuit see
