bibliometrics: its theoretical foundations, methods and
    applications. the term 'bibliometrics' was coined by pritchard
    in 1969 to replace the term 'statistical bibliography' but the
    1st bibliometric study appears to have been made by cole and
    eales in 1917 when they conducted a statistical analysis of
    comparative anatomy literature published between 1550-1860.
    bibliometric data conform to a number of laws viz. bradford's
    law, lotka's law, and zipf's law. the major sources of data are
    bibliographies and citations. bibliometrics has its
    applications in the fields of book and periodical selection,
    characteristics of subject literature, evaluation of
    collections and bibliographies, history, and sociology.
