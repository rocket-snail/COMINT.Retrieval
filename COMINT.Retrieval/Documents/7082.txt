methods for the calculation of transient distortion based
    on the general properties of transfer functions theories of
    transients in filters developed by kupfmuller wheeler and cotte
    are compared cottes method of calculation is considered most
    suitable for the general investigation of transient distortion
    a definition of bandwidth is proposed it is shown that in the
    general case there is no simple analytical relation of the type
    derived by kupfmuller between bandwidth and rise time see also
