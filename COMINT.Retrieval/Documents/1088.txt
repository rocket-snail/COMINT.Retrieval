pulse switching circuits using magnetic cores design
    theory is presented for nonstorage uses of cores with
    rectangular hysteresis loops in digital computers to facilitate
    determination of the sense of the em processes a method of
    representation due to mayer is used in which the magnetic
    circuit elements are replaced by elements of a mirror system
    devices for eliminating output voltage on shuttling the core
    are discussed operating frequencies are attainable
