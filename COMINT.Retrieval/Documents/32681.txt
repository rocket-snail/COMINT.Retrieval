an analysis of a class of variable frequency sinusoidal
    oscillators using a single active element an analysis is given
    of a class of oscillators requiring a single active element
    with an electronically variable mutual conductance the
    oscillation frequency is directly or inversely proportional to
    two experimental circuits are described and compared with
    theory
