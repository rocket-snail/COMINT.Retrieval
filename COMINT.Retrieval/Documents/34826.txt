the design of filters using only rc sections and gain
    stages a method is described of synthesizing filters using rc
    sections within a feedback loop design information is given for
    high and low pass filters of and per octave slope and fixed cut
    off frequency and others of approximately and per octave slope
    whose cut off frequency is variable continuously by the
    adjustment of a single element
