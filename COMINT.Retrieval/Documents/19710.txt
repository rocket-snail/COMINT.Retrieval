microwave study of positive ion collection by probes the
    electron density in a plasma is determined from the shift in
    resonance frequency of a cavity in which a discharge is
    maintained the results are used to verify theory of positive
    ion collection by negatively biased or double probes
    experiments were performed in h ar and he at pressures from to
    mm hg agreement between experimental and theoretical results is
    good at the lower pressures at high pressures the probe
    collected about twice the current predicted by theory
