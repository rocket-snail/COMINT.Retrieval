why produce current bibliographies in the netherlands?.
    more than 100 current bibliographies are being published at the
    present time in the netherlands. in the past many attempts to
    produce current bibliographies have failed from lack of
    financial support. in the field of bibliographical control the
    most important development has been the introduction of the
    computer enabling complex searches to be made rapidly on very
    large data bases. major reasons for producing a current
    bibliography include the wish to keep abreast of material
    published in or about an individual country or region and the
    desire to make scattered references on a particular subject
    more readily available. in future the emphasis in
    bibliographical control will be on more comprehensive
    coverage.
