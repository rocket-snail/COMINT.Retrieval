some features of the development of research library book
    stocks within a region. over the last 20 years there has been a
    rapid growth both in the numbers of libraries and in the size
    of their stocks. belorussia provides an example of this and its
    statistics can be favourably compared with those of the ussr as
    a whole. the development of new libraries into cooperative
    networks necessitated specialisation in book selection, but
    there was found to be little value in small libraries
    specialising while all the larger ones maintained universal
    stocks. various methods of profiling were used to avoid
    this.
