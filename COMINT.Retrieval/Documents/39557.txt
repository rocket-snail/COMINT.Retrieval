stimulated light emission by optical pumping and by
    energy transfer in organic molecules observations of stimulated
    light emission in organic glass matrices are described
    particularly in glass containing ap approximately of
    benzophenone and of naphthalene in which energy is absorbed by
    the naphthalene in which energy is absorbed by the benzophenone
    and transferred to the naphthalene
