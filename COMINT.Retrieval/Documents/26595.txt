diffraction field of a circular aperture an equation
    expressing the diffracted field is derived for the case of a
    normally incident plane wave and a perfectly reflecting screen
    the equation is of the form given by stratton of but is
    modiffied to agree with certain theoretically and
    experimentally established conditions
