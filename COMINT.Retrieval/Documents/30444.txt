conservation in music libraries. an updated version of a
    paper presented as a joint report to the research libraries
    commission at the 11th congress of the iaml, mainz, 1977.
    discusses how the deterioration of books and paper can be
    brought about by' environmental factors; the intrinsic
    properties of the materials used; mechanical factors (i.e.
    general wear and tear); and biological factors (attacks by
    fungi, insects, etc.). describes briefly some of the major
    conservation techniques such as deacidification and lamination.
    suggests a number of ways in which librarians can instigate
    conservation measures in their own libraries, and mentions some
    remedies that should be avoided. notes the steps which have
    been taken towards setting up international and national
    cooperative preservation programmes.
