    on medical librarianship, who/unesco, belgrade, sept 80.)
    discusses the choice of equipment for computerised retrieval
    systems in the light of training requirements for present
    staff. emphasises that the acceptance of purchased systems is
    highly dependent on the training effort made. elements of
    systems (networks, hardware and software) are related to the
    training techniques needed.
