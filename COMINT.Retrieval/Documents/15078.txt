experiments on the behaviour of an ionized gas in a
    magnetic field probe measurements in a plasma comprising
    electrons and helium ions in a toroidal tube with a toroidal
    magnetic field reveal an oscillatory current which is
    interpreted as indicating fluctuations of ion concentration
    consistent with magnetohydrodynamic waves of the type described
    by alfven of microwave measurements on a toroidal cavity
    resonator indicate that the degree of diffusion control in
    helium at low pressure is very much less than expected from the
    classical theory of ambipolar diffusion of ions and electrons
    in a magnetic field the diffusion coefficient magnetic field
    curve passes through a minimum at about tentative explanations
    of the experimental results are advanced
