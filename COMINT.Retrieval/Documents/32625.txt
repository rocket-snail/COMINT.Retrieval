contribution to the theory of ferroelectric polarization
    curves the principles of the polarization theory for single and
    many domain ferroelectric crystals with one or two curie points
    are developed for weak strong and medim fields in contrast to
    magnetization curve theory rotation can be neglected in the
    first approximation
