charge penetration into a conductor in equilibrium
    statistical mechanics is used to show that the electric charge
    on a conductor in equilibrium is not restricted to its surface
    but penetrates into the interior in the form of a space charge
    density the effective penetration depth being of the order of a
    few atomic distances similarly the electric potential in a
    charged conductor is not strictly constant but varies in space
    which results in a small but finite potential difference
    between the interior and the surface layers
