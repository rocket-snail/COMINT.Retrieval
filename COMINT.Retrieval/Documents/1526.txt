library planning for future networks. automation
    developments of individual libraries are viewed as leading
    toward involvement in networks. the primary issues of
    machine-readable record formats, holdings formats mechanisms
    for updating machine-readable data bases, and system interfaces
    for hardware, software, and operating systems need to be
    addressed if the local developments are to be a step toward the
    library's eventual networking capabilities. libraries and the
    bibliographic networks are all progressing in their use of
    computer technology, but not necessarily toward a common
    goal.
