long delay ionospheric echoes at a report of results
    obtained at pennsylvania state college ionosphere research
    laboratory using a vertical incidence pulse transmitter with mw
    peak power recordings with a min exposure were made every half
    hour from to of the signals received on an aerial system
    suitable for receiving circularly polarized waves three records
    obtained on november showed an isolated echo corresponding to a
    reflection height of about km the echo only appeared on the
    records of the extraordinary wave similar records were obtained
    on two subsequent nights possible explanations of these long
    delay echoes are considered they may be due to reflections from
    a region above the height of maximum ionization of the f
    region
