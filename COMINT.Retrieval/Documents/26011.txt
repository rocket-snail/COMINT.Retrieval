transmission of electromagnetic waves through pairs of
    parallel wire grids an analytical solution is obtained for the
    power transmission coefficient of a double grid system
    transmission coefficients are plotted as functions of the
    integrid spacing for different wire spacing and angles of tilt
    the curves are compared with those obtained by measurement at
    cm using wire of radius cm agreement is good until the wire
    spacing approaches reasons for this divergence are noted
