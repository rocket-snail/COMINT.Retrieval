a special classification for general linguistics. the
    classification described is a shortened version of a
    classification used for a classified catalogue of general
    linguistics and originally devised for the systematic
    documentation of essays and dependent works at the institute of
    general linguistics in munster. since the essays are on highly
    specialised subjects, a classification of great depth was
    needed which, because of costs and organisational problems, had
    to be operable manually. manual procedures also reduce the risk
    of faulty indexing. the classification is strictly hierarchic
    since it must be capable of vertical and horizontal expansion
    without risk of structural alteration. work on the scheme began
    in 1978; the 21 main classes are listed with their subordinate
    sections.
