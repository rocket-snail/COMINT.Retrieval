a comparison of media services of washington community
    colleges and oregon state colleges and universities. the
    educational media programmes, staffing, and budgets of 27
    community colleges in washington and 7 state colleges and
    universities in oregon are compared in this study. the results
    indicate close similarity in the types of services offered.
    most washington community colleges have integrated
    library-media programmes. less than half of the state colleges
    and universities in oregon have integrated library-media
    programmes. media staff size appears to be larger in oregon
    with respect to the ratio of staff to students but smaller in
    terms of the ratio of staff to faculty. although the overall
    media dollars spent per student are not much different between
    the 2 states, the washington community colleges have a more
    generous budget for operations, equipment, and
    materials.
