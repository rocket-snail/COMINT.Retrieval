geomagnetic distortion of the f region on the magnetic
    equator calculations based on an atmospheric model inferred
    from rocket observations and using the dynamo theory of the
    earths magnetic field show that the diurnal variation of the
    vertical electron drift due to the es field is sufficient to
    account for the observed distortion of the f region over the
    magnetic equator the presence of the f layer is also accounted
    for changes following the sunspot cycle may be caused by a
    slight shift of the phase of the drift
