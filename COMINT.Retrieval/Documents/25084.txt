a choice between quality or quantity' the consequences of
    the recruitment ban in enschede public library. since the world
    war ii the public library service in the netherlands has
    undergone a period of rapid growth. in many towns, new central
    libraries and branch libraries have been opened and special
    services have been initiated, such as mobile library services,
    record libraries and services to foreign workers and open
    school students. in addition, the dutch government plans to
    increase the number of regional support libraries from 13 to
    19. however, enschede public library, which has been designated
    a regional support library, is compelled by financial cutbacks
    to reduce its present staffing levels by 25%. as a result the
    library will be unable to maintain the current volume of loans
    and consideration has been given to limiting the number of
    books which a borrower may take throughout the year and to
    refusing to enrol new members.
