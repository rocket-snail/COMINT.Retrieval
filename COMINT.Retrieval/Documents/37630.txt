the ring current geomagnetic disturbance and the van
    allen radiation belts the negative phase of a magnetic storm is
    ascribed to the formation of a ring current at a distance about
    four earths radii from the earths centre the magnetic field due
    to the current is calculated and compared with observational
    results
