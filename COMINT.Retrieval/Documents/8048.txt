comparison of results obtained using the chemical
    abstracts data base in searches performed through dialog and
    esa-quest. report of research carried out at the spanish
    national scientific information and documentation centre
    (cenidoc). identical searches were performed through the dialog
    and esa-quest systems, using 2chemical abstracts1 (ca), for
    equal lengths of time. full details are given of the initial
    research hypothesis to explain previously observed differences
    in references retrieved, and the construction of the ca file.
    results obtained using a wide variety of search criteria are
    presented. the systems agreed only when registration numbers or
    periodical codes were used, and more information was always
    obtained through dialog using indexing terms. the conclusion
    reached is that quest does not use the complete ca search, and
    details are given of its limitations.
