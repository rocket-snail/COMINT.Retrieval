high frequency diffraction by a wedge with a linearly
    varying surface impedance an asymptotic representation valid
    both in the illuminated and shadow regions is derived for the
    scattered field due to an incident plane wave and its
    properties are analysed as a function of the rate of variation
    of surface impedance
