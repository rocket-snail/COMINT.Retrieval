lowest eigenvalues of nearly circular regions analysis
    relevant to waveguides and vibrating membranes is presented the
    principal eigenvalue of the nearly circular element is found by
    a method involving the circle of equal area the usefulness of
    the method is illustrated by comparing approximate values thus
    found for a rectangle with the exact values
