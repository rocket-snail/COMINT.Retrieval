second approximation in the method of small perturbations
    the propagation of a plane wave in a medium containing random
    inhomogeneities is considered a second approximation in the
    perturbation method is obtained assuming that the correlation
    coefficient of refractive index fluctuations is gaussian this
    is applied to determine the form of the normalizing factor in
    the wave equation
