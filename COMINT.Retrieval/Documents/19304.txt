electromagnet oscillations in a parabolic tube as a
    particular case of the interactions of tow cavities through a
    throat free oscillations in a tube of parabolic profile and
    rectangular cross section are considered the tube is regarded
    as consisting of two cavities interacting through the throat
    the wave equation is derived and solutions are found for the
    cases where the two cavities are identical and not identical
    experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical
    conclusions
