a comparison of two systems of weighted boolean
    retrieval. a major deficiency of traditional boolean systems is
    their inability to represent the varying degrees to which a
    document may be written on a subject. in this article a number
    of criteria that should be met by any boolean system
    generalised to have a weighting capability are isolated. it is
    proven that only 1 weighting rule satisfies these conditions;
    that associated with fuzzy-set theory; and that this weighting
    scheme satisfies most of the other properties associated with
    boolean algebra as well. probabilistic weighting is then
    introduced as an alternative approach and the 2 systems
    compared. in the limit of zero/1 weights, all systems
    considered converge to traditional boolean retrieval.
