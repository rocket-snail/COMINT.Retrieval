books at the workplace: are workplace libraries needed?.
    contribution to an issue devoted to public library services in
    sweden. questions the need for workplace libraries in sweden
    vis-a-vis provision of public and branch libraries. in fact,
    almost 2/3 of the swedish population do not regularly use their
    local municipal library-they have not discovered the library as
    an intellectual resource, or as a source of pleasure and
    emotional experience. suggests the benefits which library use
    can afford the population, and sees the paucity of usage as a
    warning signal to school staff, popular educationists and trade
    unions.
