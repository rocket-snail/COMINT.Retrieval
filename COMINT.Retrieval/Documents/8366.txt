the invisible library. argues that the neglect of pr
    activities by public libraries has led to an increasing lack of
    understanding of their basic aims among politicians and a
    consequent reduction in their budgets. the library service
    occupies a modest place in the public debate compared to other
    sectors because it has no competitors and the public lacks a
    basis for comparison. library matters get little publicity
    either in the national, local or professional press. actions by
    user groups, especially if these are generally respected
    citizens, can be very effective and contact with organisations
    such as the chamber of commerce and the trade unions should be
    nurtured by the library. this could take the form of 'friends
    of the library groups, as found largely in the usa, or, more in
    line with danish practice, user councils.
