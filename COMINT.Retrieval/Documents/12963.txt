cathode drift compensation in dc amplifiers the miller
    circuit has been found effective in compensating against
    cathode drift but it has been assumed necessary to use a load
    resistance large enough to make the anode current of the output
    valve small compared with that of the other simple analysis is
    presented to show that this limitation is unnecessary an
    improvement of the circuit based on this analysis is
    suggested
