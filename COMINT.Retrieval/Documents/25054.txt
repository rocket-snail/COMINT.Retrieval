a simple varying capacitor method for the measurement of
    contact potential difference in high vacuum apparatus based on
    kelvins original method and suitable for use at a pressure of
    mm hg is described the value found for the contact potential
    difference between cu and ag films evaporated on to w sheets
    was the ag being positive with respect to the cu
