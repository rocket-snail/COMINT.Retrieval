electromagnetic properties of plasmas conditions for the
    propagation of longitudinal and transverse em waves are
    considered taking account of the effect of collisions on
    electron velocities and assuming no applied magnetic field the
    mobility coefficient relating the electric field to the mean
    velocity imparted by it to the electrons and dispersion
    formulae linking wavelength and frequency of the propagated
    disturbance are derived
