transistors in amplifier output stages the optimum
    effective load impedance and the efficiency are calculated
    using idealized characteristic curves the results for point
    contact and junction type transistors in class a and in class b
    pushpull amplifiers are compared with the corresponding
    formulae for triodes and pentodes distortion the efficiency
    limit and circuit design are also briefly considered
