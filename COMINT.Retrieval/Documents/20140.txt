termination variation in the constant k filter the
    problem treated is that of finding the modification required in
    a conventional filter when the terminations are resistive but
    otherwise quite general the filter elements are given
    normalized values and in addition modified by factors and to
    correspond with the change in termination from equal values to
    those modified by factors and from the expressions for the
    insertion transfer ratio of the original and of the modified
    circuit by equating appropriate terms and solving a diagram is
    constructed relating the four factors and two numerical
    examples illustrate the practical application of the diagram in
    the design of filter half sections full section and
    multisection filters are treated in similar fashion the
    calculations being correspondingly more complex
