the relation between electrical and diffusion currents a
    linear relation is derived between the electric current through
    a conducting gas in a magnetic field and the currents due to
    diffusion of the charge carriers in the gas from this relation
    the vertical displacements of the ionosphere e layer due to
    lunar effects are determined from the current system inferred
    from the lunar changes of the geomagnetic field both the
    amplitude and phase of the displacement are consistent with
    observations if it is assumed that the main lunar current flows
    in the lower part of the e layer and that approximately equal
    numbers of ions and electrons are present at the point of
    observation
