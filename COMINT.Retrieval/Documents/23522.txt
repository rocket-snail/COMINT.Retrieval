regional bibliographies. in accordance with the dynamic
    development in socialist countries, greater attention has been
    turned to regional and local problems recently. members of the
    governing bodies must therefore be kept abreast of the latest
    information on their regions to be able to run their economy
    smoothly and to pursue the correct cultural and other policies.
    thus departments of local history in libraries, and those in
    the central district libraries in particular, have the duty and
    responsibility to build up appropriate bibliographic resources.
    in addition to books, daily papers and periodicals, non-book
    materials such as records, tapes, documentary films, slides,
    photos and picture postcards have become rather significant. as
    to contents, materials have to be sifted very carefully to give
    a comprehensive knowledge of facts, events and development in
    the relevant region.
