the microwave properties of precipitation particles the
    theory of scattering and attenuation by rain snow and cloud is
    reviewed and theoretical results are presented in the form of
    equations are presented in the form of equations tables and
    graphs so that the radar response to meteorological particles
    can be calculated at six wavelengths and various temperatures
    particular emphasis is placed on developments since rydes
    comprehensive paper in published experimental results are
    compared with the theory all results computed from the theory
    are contained in tables and the attenuation by water vapour and
    oxygen is given in an appendix
