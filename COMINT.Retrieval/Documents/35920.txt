collisional effects and the conduction current iin an
    ionized gas a first approximation to the transport equation for
    the conduction current in a binary ionized gas id derived the
    collision damping factor derived is a weighted mean of the
    electron and ion collision frequencies which is times the
    electron collision frequency corresponding approximations made
    to the equations of conservation motion and thermal energy when
    combined with maxwells equations yield a set of equations for
    the investigation of the interactions between an ionized gas in
    motion and the associated radiation field the results are
    applicable to the solar atmosphere and the h h and lower
    ionosphere regions
