a method of finding a large class of electrostatic and
    magnetic fields for which the solutions of the fundamental
    equation of electron optics may be expressed in terms of known
    functions exact solutions of equation are of great interest for
    various types of e s and magnetic fields until recently such
    solutions were known only for a very limited number of cases
    grinberg in particular indicated a class of fields for which
    the trajectories of electrons are expressed in terms of
    cylindrical functions solutions are now found for a much larger
    class of fields
