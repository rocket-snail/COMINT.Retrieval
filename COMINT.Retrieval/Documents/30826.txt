great differences in the financial position and level of
    services of research libraries. comments on the sections of a
    report by the research planning council' 2the conditions for
    research in the public sector1 which deal with research
    libraries. the conclusion is that the reduction of funds
    available for acquisition of literature has led to severe
    problems for research. analysis of the development in the 1970s
    shows increase in expenditure on staff and fall in the real
    value of that for acquisitions, together with a doubling of
    issues. the comemnts on libraries are scattered throughout the
    report, but can be classed as those that mention' libraries
    without problems of acquisition, or libraries where problems
    have not yet arisen, and libraries with considerable problems.
    arts faculties have seen an increase in subjects and foreign
    specialised literature coinciding with a decrease in book
    grants. in the natural science faculties, institute libraries
    have been forced to acquire books which would normally have
    been borrowed from a research library; gaps are appearing in
    runs of periodicals, and reference works are in short supply.
    service level has gone down as a result of undermanning of
    libraries. some libraries, for example those of the
    agricultural and the commercial high schools, stand out as
    particularly hard hit.
