ferromagnetic relaxation part the role of four magnon
    processes in relaxing the magnetization in ferromagnetic
    insulators the effect of the exchange induced four magnon
    process should be observable in parallel pumping experiments
    four magnon processes arising from dipole cubic anisotropy and
    exchange coupling are not very effective in relaxing the
    uniform precession
