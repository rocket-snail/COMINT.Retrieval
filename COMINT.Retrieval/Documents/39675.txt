charge densities in the ionosphere from radio doppler
    data a method is described whereby the directly observable
    radial velocities of a missile relative to a ground receiver
    both in a radio doppler electronic system of tracking may be
    compared to radial velocities determined by vacuum trajectory
    formulae and the differences converted to ionization densities
    at the levels through which the rocket is passing this method
    was used to compute ion densities for several missiles fired at
    the white sands proving ground new mexico results gave density
