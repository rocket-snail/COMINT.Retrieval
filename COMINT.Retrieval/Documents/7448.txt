observations on the ionospheric f layer at night part
    height of maximum ionization critical frequency and semi
    thickness of f layer at night measurements taken at cambridge
    england agree with those for other stations the scale height
    determined from the semi thickness of the layer is too small
    when compared with rocket and satellite observations
