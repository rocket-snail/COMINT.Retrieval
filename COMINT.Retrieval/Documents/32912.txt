resonance conditions in a sytem of two circuits with
    inductive coupling assuming m r l and c constant conditions are
    derived for the existence of one minimum and two maximum values
    of current in the secondary in the general and in two
    particular cases the results are applied to a band pass filter
    and presented graphically for two different parameter valuex
    low q values are assumed
