antiferromagnetism a survey of theoretical and
    experimental aspects the spin wave approximation is useful
    especially for lattices of higher dimensions and for larger
    magnitudes of spin this method can be easily generalized eg so
    as to take second neighbour interactions and dipole forces into
    account great mathematical difficulties are involved in the
    refinement of the theory to apply to higher temperatures and
    the calculation of higher order quantities such as the
    fluctuations or the short range order over references see also
