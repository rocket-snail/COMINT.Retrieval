the professional preparation of librarians at university
    level. the professional training of librarians has not improved
    in italy during the last 50 years. university reform has
    completely ignored the problem of library organisation in
    respect of research and teaching. librarians should take degree
    courses in the specific disciplines of the cultural areas
    served by the libraries in which they intend to work.
    professional preparation cannot be considered complete without
    adequate practical experience. librarians lacking the capacity
    to organise a library on traditional lines will not profit much
    from the assistance of advanced technology. the university
    should rationalise its own libraries and concentrate its
    internal services at all levels on satisfying the requests of
    all potential readers.
