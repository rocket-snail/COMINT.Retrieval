resonance type secondary electron multiplication electron
    multiplication by means of an hf field applied between a pair
    of parallel plates with secondary electron emission rate
    greater than unity is considered theoretically and a relation
    is derived between the hf amplitude the length of field lines
    and the phase at impact required for avalanche multiplication
    expressions ar also obtained for the starting and cut off
    voltages calculated results are in good agreement with
    experimental results see also of
