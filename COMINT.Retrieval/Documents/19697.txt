ala in san francisco' councilor's report. report of the
    council session at the ala annual conference, san francisco,
    1981, presenting a personal view of council's 'operating
    agreement between ala and divisions', currently under revision.
    new by-laws which set student dues in divisions at $5.00 and
    authorise divisions to set up national conferences generated
    strong support. this latter decision reflects the impossibility
    of joining divisions and round tables of peripheral interest,
    and its questionable whether the national or regional
    conferences will hurt state conferences in terms of attendance
    and exhibitors.
