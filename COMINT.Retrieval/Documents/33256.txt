a study of the problems of information flows in selected
    physicochemical problem areas. determines volumes of document
    flow in selected physicochemical problem areas and the pattern
    of distribution of serial and periodical articles. both
    parameters are shown to vary with time and problem. no
    significant differences are identified in the subject
    orientation of publications grouped according to the bradford
    3-zone model. suggests that to develop reference/information
    collections in specific subject areas, all published sources
    should be separated into 2 broad categories-core publications
    with respect to a given theme and the rest. describes a method
    for identifying core publications.
