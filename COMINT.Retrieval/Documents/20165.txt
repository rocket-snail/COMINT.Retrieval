the periodic solutions of a nonlinear differential
    equation of the second order with unsymmetrical nonlinear
    damping and a forcing term the differential equation considered
    gives a closer approximation to the behaviour of valve
    oscillators than the van der pol equation and demonstrates the
    frequency deviation associated with the presence of higher
    harmonics
