on the properties of the electron beam in the presence of
    an axial magnetic field of arbitrary strength a study of the
    effect of an axial magnetic field on the propagation of waves
    in an idealized electron beam using small signal theory and
    neglecting collisional effects the possibility of angular
    asymmetric excitation is considered and special attention is
    paid to the influence of the a c drift lorentz terms and of the
    relativistic corrections in the derived equations
