continuing education in library science in the united
    states. a summary translation of a paper given at the
    university of sao paulo in 1979, surveying the us situation,
    where the necessity for continuing library science education is
    generally agreed, but satisfactory implementation of programmes
    is not yet fully achieved. the account covers activities to
    date by the library schools, professional associations, and
    national bodies; the fields in which training is most
    essential; and the problems of sponsorship for courses, systems
    of official recognition, and location and organisation.
