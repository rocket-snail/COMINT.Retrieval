theory of noisy quadripoles analysis is based on
    equivalent circuits in which the original quadripole is
    depicted as noise free all noise sources being transferred to a
    separate noise quadripole connected in front of it the noise
    figure is found from the equivalent noise resistance the
    equivalent noise conductance and a complex correlation
    admittance methods for the experimental determination of the
    elements of the noise quadripole are outlined
