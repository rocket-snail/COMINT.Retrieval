derivation of a frequency multiple of a variable
    frequency a mask is placed across the face of k c r o
    displaying the variable frequency f the mask outline is
    sinusoid representing the frequency multiple n it is viewed by
    a photocell whose output varies at a frequency nf equations
    defining the mask outline for any value of n are given
