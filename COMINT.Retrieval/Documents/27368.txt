pulling effect in synchronized systems synchronization of
    a valve oscillator with a low pass filter in the feedback loop
    is considered and the phase equation method of analysis applied
    with parameters m and t proportional to the detuning and to the
    filter time constant respectively for the operating point lies
    within the synchronization range but the system remains in the
    asynchronous state ie pulling effect exists for values of
    greater than a critical value for the system is synchronized
    and if this is an initial condition of the system
    synchronization will be maintained for values of up to unity a
    graph of the pulling function ie the relation between m and t
    obtained in part by analysis in part from experiment is shown
    the case of a limiter in the feedback loop is also
    considered
