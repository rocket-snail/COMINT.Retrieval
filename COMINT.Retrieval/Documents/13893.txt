a critical discussion about special ionospheric
    characteristics twelve month running means of f and r are
    compared for locations and linear relations between the two are
    apparent for limited regions deviations from linearity may be
    genuine at some locations and due to magnetic effects but may
    arise from observational errors and inconsistencies at others
    present data are inadequate for examination of m factors on a
    world wide basis
