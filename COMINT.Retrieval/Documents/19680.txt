    week-end school at bath in april 1980. comprises 2 papers:
    partnerships, by jane anderson which argues for closer,
    deliberate collaboration between public library systems and

    must find a way of developing national policies and strategies
    vis-a-vis educational broadcasting, they must present
    themselves as providers and partners in adult education rather
    than as servicing agents, and they must become more aggressive
    as service retailers, professionals, and potential
    collaborators with other agencies.
