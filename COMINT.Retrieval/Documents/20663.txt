a comparison of tree-balancing algorithms several
    algorithms-height-balance (i.e. avl and extensions),
    weight-balance (i.e. bb and wb), and total restructuring-for
    building balanced binary search trees are compared. the
    criteria for comparison encompass theoretical aspects (e.g.
    path lengths) and implementation independent and
    machine/algorithm-dependent measures (e.g. run time). a
    detailed analysis of code is also presented at a level believed
    to be language-and compiler-independent. the quality of the
    resulting trees and the overhead spent on building them are
    analyzed, and some guidelines are given for an efficient use of
    the methods. if insertion and subsequent queries are the only
    operations of in terest, then "pure" avl trees present the
    overall best qualities. may, 1977 baer, j. l. schwab, b. binary
