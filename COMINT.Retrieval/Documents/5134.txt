response of a series of resonant circuits to an applied
    emf whose frequency is a linear function of time a formula is
    derived for the response of two or three rlc circuits in series
    to an emf of unit amplitude represented by the expression where
    is half the frequency sweep speed the fluctuations in the
    response curve of a single circuit are very much reduced when
    several circuits are connected in series the increase of
    selectivity obtainable is investigated and frequency sweep
    speeds permissible for one two and three circuits are
    determined
