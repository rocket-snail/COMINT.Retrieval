confocal multimode resonator for millimetre through
    optical wavelength masers the mode patterns and diffraction
    losses are obtained for a resonator formed by two concave
    spherical reflectors these are shown to be a minimum hen the
    reflector spacing equals the common radius of curvature of the
    reflectors the optical alignment is not extremely
    critical
