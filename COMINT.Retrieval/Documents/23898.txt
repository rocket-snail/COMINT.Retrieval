on the interpretation of the doppler effect from senders
    in an artificial satellite the doppler effect is simply related
    to the angle of incidence of the transmitted signal if the
    geomagnetic field is ignored otherwise the relationship is
    complex and an investigation of the actual ray paths is
    necessary even for the deduction of approximate numerical
    values
