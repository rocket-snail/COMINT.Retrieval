plasma oscillations in a periodic potential the one zone
    theory the plasma oscillation theory of collective electron
    interactions developed by bohm and pines of and back references
    can be applied to the problem of the cn conduction electrons in
    metals by modifying it to take account of the periodic
    potential present this modification is carried out neglecting
    the interactions of electrons in different zones and assuming
    that the effect of inter zone transitions on the collective
    behaviour is small enough to be treated by perturbation theory
    the main effect of the potential is to alter the effective mass
    of the electrons
