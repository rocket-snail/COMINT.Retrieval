methods and means for microfilming colour sources of
    scientific and technical information. discusses the unique
    aspects of the microfilming of scientific and technical data in
    the soviet state scientific and technical information system.
    considers methods and means of colour microfilming on
    multilayer materials, possibilities of spectrum and zone
    photography, additive colour picture synthesisers, holography,
    lippmann photography, and photography with carrier frequency.
    black-and-white and colour microfilming system compatibility
    can be attained when using spectrum and zone methods. this is
    of particular interest for those services in which a relatively
    small amount of material being microfilmed is in colour.
