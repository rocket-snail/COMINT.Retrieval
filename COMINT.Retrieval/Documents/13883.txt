classification policies in denmark. aims to give some
    ideas of classification and indexing policies in danish public
    and research libraries as well as a state-of-the-art report of
    present literature searching. discusses the influence of new
    technology and the possibilities of utilising data such as
    subject entries from marc tapes for cataloguing, and predicts a
    development within the next 10 years towards on-line
    information systems in 1 or both of the danish library sectors,
    either as large shared systems or, perhaps more likely, as
    smaller library data bases in networks.
