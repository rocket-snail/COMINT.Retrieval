nomenclature and conventions used in analysis of
    ionospheric data it is proposed to classify the layers
    according to their thickness a critical thickness is introduced
    to define the difference between normal layers which are always
    thick and abnormal thin layers caused by transitory phenomena
    the term critical frequency may be used of thin layers if
    account is taken of the intensity of the echoes characteristics
    directly determined and those found by extrapolation should be
    distinguished revised lists of characteristic symbols and code
    letters are given in appendices
