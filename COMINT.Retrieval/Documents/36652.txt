electronic circuits of the narec crystal diodes are used
    where practical for all nonlinear functions in this digital
    computer thermionic valves being used only for inversion or
    amplification all circuits are designed to provide low
    impedance output signals whose maximum and minimum levels are
    held to prescribed potentials the circuits are packaged in
    standard valve plug in units see also
