elevation height and electron density of echoing points
    of meteor trails these parameters may be evaluated by the
    continuous operation of cw equipment on mcs at least of all
    echoes are found to be distorted the electron density
    distributions are in qualitative agreement with known meteor
    mass distributions and trail shapes
