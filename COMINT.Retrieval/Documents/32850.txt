origin of the f layer the splitting of the f layer into
    the f and f layers is considered to be be due to a thermal
    effect the maximum temperature occurs in the region of maximum
    ion production but since the density of gas in this region is a
    minimum higher electron concentrations will occur above and
    below it the region of maximum ionization lies in the lower
    half of the f layer and hence the f layer will be thinner than
    the f layer the formula derived for the height distribution of
    the electron concentration shows that the thermal process could
    lead to splitting of an ionized layer and also explains the
    secondary nocturnal maximum of the peculiarities of the
    equatorial layer described by osborne are briefly
    discussed
