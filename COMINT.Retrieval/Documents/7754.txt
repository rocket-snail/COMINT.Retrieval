radiation of plasma oscillation radiation of em waves
    from a mercury discharge tube was picked up by a horn feeding a
    receiver tuned to a peak value of received signal was obtained
    for a discharge current corresponding to a plasma resonant at
    reflections from the plasma were also observed they reached a
    peak value at the same discharge current but did not fall with
    higher currents
