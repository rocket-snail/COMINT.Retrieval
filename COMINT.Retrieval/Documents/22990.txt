magnetic pulse modulators mathematical analyses are given
    of and charged series type saturable reactors for generating
    pulses in radar systems automatic core resetting is achieved
    the production of pulses of duration and the prevention of
    parasitics in the output are discussed and a circuit is
    described enabling the thyratron cathode in a charged modulator
    to be operated at ground potential
