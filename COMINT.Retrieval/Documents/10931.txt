correlation in the fluctuating outputs from two square
    law detectors illuminated by light of any state of coherence
    and polarization the correlation is found by treating light
    fluctuations as a random process the expression takes a
    particularly simple form when the light is spectrally pure two
    special cases are applicable to the hanbury brown twiss effect
    of and to correlation experiments with light from optical
