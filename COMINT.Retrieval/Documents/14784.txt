a parametric amplifier using lower frequency pumping
    experimental verification of the principle of parametric
    amplification using a pumping frequency lower than the signal
    frequency is described variable inductance ferrite core and
    variable capacitance semiconductor diode elements have both
    been used the former at with pumping at and the latter at with
    pumping at bandwidth and noise have been measured as functions
    of gain for the diode amplifier and the results compared with
    theory see also of june and
