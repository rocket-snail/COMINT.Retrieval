a general mathematical treatment applicable to certain
    electrode systems formulae are developed for a basic system of
    two coaxial dielectric cylinders of different homogeneous and
    isotropic media containing an embedded line charge these are
    applied to determine the field in a circular cylinder electrode
    system the result being expressed as series converging
    reasonably rapidly other electrode systems considered are a
    semi infinite strip an elliptic cylinder and a parabolic
    cylinder
