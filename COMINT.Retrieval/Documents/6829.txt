a piezoelectric high pass filter a lattice filter is
    considered whose special feature is the use of transformers in
    its arms with crystals included in the secondary circuits the
    main parameters of the filter are determined and formulae are
    derived for calculating the resonances and antiresonance
    frequencies of the arms a method is proposed for designing the
    filter elements and for calculating its basic loss the
    experimental curve of a filter designed in this manner shows a
    sharp cut off
