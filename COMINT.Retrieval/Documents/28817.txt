highly regulated rf voltage supply a rf output voltage of
    rms maximum with low harmonic content is obtained by using a
    crystal controlled pentode oscillator at the fundamental
    frequency with positive feedback regulation of the output is
    achieved by means of a negative feedback loop incorporating a
    high gain dc amplifier which supplies the oscillator screen
