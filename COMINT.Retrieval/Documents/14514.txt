using page residency to select the working set parameter
    denning's method for selecting the working set parameter, which
    uses interreference intervals, is examined. several omissions
    in his model are noted, and new assumptions are introduced to
    overcome these omissions. using this modified model, dening's
    results on page residency are rederived and reconsidered for
    selecting the working set parameter. october, 1973 prieve, b.
