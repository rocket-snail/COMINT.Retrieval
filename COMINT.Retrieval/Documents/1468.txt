a statistical study on the minimum frequency in curve for
    the e region of the ionosphere the diurnal and seasonal
    variation of the minimum frequency in the curve for the e
    region is investigated and also its relation to the sunspot
    number the diurnal variation suggests the existence below the e
    layer of an absorbing layer which is ionized by solar radiation
    the electron density in the d layer is estimated to be
    cm
