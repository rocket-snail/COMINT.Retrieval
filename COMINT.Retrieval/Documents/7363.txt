q factor anomalies in series coupled ferrite rod
    inductances an examination of the variation of the q factor of
    a coil divided into two series coupled parts positioned at
    different points on the core results are discussed with
    reference to high q oscillatory circuits and in particular the
    efficiency of ferrite rod aerials
