books have their own destiny; about the paris library of
    i.s. turgenev. the fate of i.s. turgenev's paris library,
    containing 3,000 volumes, remains unresolved. only 12 volumes
    definitely survive. in 1897, turgenev's compatriots asked his
    heiress, polina viardot to donate books from turgenev's paris
    library to the orlovsk provincial museum. she denied possessing
    the library. turgenev had 1643 russian books in paris, 816
    german, 147 english and 246 french. a note in a turgenev
    ex-libris mentions his russian books were sold in leipzig.
    occasionally turgenev's books return from oblivion and arrive
    in the orlov i.s. turgenev museum. the surviving books from
    turgenev's paris library are multifarious, but all associated
    with his circle and studies.
