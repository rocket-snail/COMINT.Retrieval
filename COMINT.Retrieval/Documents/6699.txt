geomagnetic activity and average deviations of daytime
    layer critical frequencies in different geomagnetic latitudes
    analysis of data from six ionospheric sounding stations and one
    geomagnetic observatory shows a distinct dependence of the
    average daytime deviations from median valves on the
    geomagnetic latitude the seasons and the sunspot cycle the
    effect on the prediction of ionospheric disturbances is
    discussed and the reliability of predictions is assessed
