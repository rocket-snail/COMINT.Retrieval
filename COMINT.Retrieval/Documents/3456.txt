an informal survey of operational microprocessor-based
    systems, autumn, 1979. traditionally computer applications in
    libraries have been limited, both in scale and type, by the
    relatively high price of conventional computer equipment.
    advances in microelectronics technology, and especially
    microprocessor-based machines, such as microcomputers and word
    processors, have the potential for radically altering this
    situation. reports on a survey undertaken by aslib to see how
    far this technology has penetrated the library and information
    world. systems in the various organisations visited are
    described, as well as the applications for which they are
    utilised.
