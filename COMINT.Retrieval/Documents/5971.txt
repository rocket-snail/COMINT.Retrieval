the book house in larsboda. important for the development
    of the swedish library service was the contact between the
    bookbinder, edvard hassler, and the library service, which led
    in 1952 to the creation of the joint binding service. hassler
    has recently moved to new premises in larsboda, where the
    library service hires 4000 sq.m. space for the binding service.
    b. skold describes the uses of this space as store,
    distribution area, offices and exhibition hall, where the work
    of the service is displayed. e. hassler describes the history
    of the bindery from its start in 1902 and its cooperation with
    the library service since 1952. today it binds 2.6 million
    library volumes and prepares 400,000 publishers' volumes. the
    new building in larsboda houses hasslerband, which is an
    umbrella organisation for 3 binderies' librex, sambok and knut
    hassler.
