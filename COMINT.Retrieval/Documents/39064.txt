the relation of magnetic micropulsations to electric
    current and space charge systems in the lower ionosphere from
    observations made in using a large wire loop theory is
    developed to suggest that micropulsations in the range are
    associated with absorption of auroral particles in the
    ionosphere and in the range are the result of the absorption
    and reflection of hydromagnetic waves in the lower
    ionosphere
