a classification scheme for local government documents
    collections. the university of dayton's roesch library required
    a classification scheme for its local documents collection. it
    needed a scheme that would assign each title a unique call
    number. existing schemes were examined but rejected. a new
    alphanumeric scheme was devised. it is intended primarily for
    collections limited to publications from the government and
    civic organisations of no more than several counties.
