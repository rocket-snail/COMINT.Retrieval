facing the public. ponders on the joint promotions
    offered by the mcdonald's fast-food chain and the us public
    library, suggesting that the former possesses all the
    attributes that the latter hankers after. librarians have a
    preference for nice, clean-cut, definable, easily-retrievable
    questions. unlike fast-food chains, however, the library has a
    mandate to serve special interests and individual needs.
    otherwise there is no need for it to exist, regardless of the
    number of fast-food items (such as paperbacks and rock records)
    that it circulates.
