spectrum intensities and radio frequency noise in a dc
    hydrogen arc rf noise generated by the arc was reduced by
    shunting the arc with a capacitor this caused an incidental
    modification of the ultraviolet spectrum the results suggest a
    connection between the noise intensity and the distribution of
    energy among the electrons
