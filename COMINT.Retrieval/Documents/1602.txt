the design of function generators using silicon carbide
    nonlinear resistors the effective current vol ge
    characteristics of sic resistors are modified by linear
    resistors placed in series and parallel such modified resistors
    are then used as input or feedback components in amplifiers to
    give nonlinear functions design details are given of squie law
    and sine function generators using this device
