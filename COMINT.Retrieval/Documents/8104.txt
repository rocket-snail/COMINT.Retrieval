some thoughts on the financing of libraries. argues that
    saving money for the university by cutting its library budget
    is counterproductive. the argument is applied to such areas as
    staff cuts and processing backlogs, serious reductions in
    service leading to undermining of the library's supportive role
    for the university's teaching and research function. argues
    that rationalisation of subject interests and subjects taught
    by the universities in an area should lead to more efficient
    use of resources.
