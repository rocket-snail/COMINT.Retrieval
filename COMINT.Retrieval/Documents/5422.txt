propagation of electric waves in stratified and
    continuously variable plasmas for a plasma of sandwich
    structure with the denser medium inside there are two possible
    frequency ranges for propagation in which the phase velocity
    falls from the value at the lower limiting frequency to zero at
    the upper limiting frequency when the density varies linearly
    towards the interior to an arbitrarily high value the wave is
    strongly concentrated at the plane for which and the phase
    velocity tends to zero for a plasma of uniform density and
    natural frequency with outer layers in which density falls off
    linearly propagation is possible only when the more the wave is
    concentrated at the region and the smaller its phase velocity
    the nearer approaches to
