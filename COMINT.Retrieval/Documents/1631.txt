patterns in the use of oclc by academic library
    cataloging departments. a survey of the cataloguing departments
    of 166 oclc-member academic libraries showed that libraries did
    not rely exclusively on oclc for card production and that a
    large majority did not accept non-library of congress oclc
    records without substantial checking. the survey indicated also
    that libraries that used or planned to use their oclc-marc
    tapes generally were more concerned with the completeness and
    accuracy of their oclc-marc tape records than libraries that
    did not plan to use their tapes.
