structure of the thermosphere the vertical distribution
    of density in the thermosphere as deduced from satellite
    observations is examined and it is shown tht the varying scale
    height gradient s is due to a decrease in the molecular weight
    of the atmospheric constituents the temperature of the night
    time isothermal atmosphere and the distribution of scale height
    in the sunlit atmosphere is related to the ultraviolet heating
    available during the day
