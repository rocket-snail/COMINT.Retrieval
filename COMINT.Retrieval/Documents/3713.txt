feeling the draft: quality in our ethical debate. report
    on the draft code of professional ethics produced by the
    library association working party on ethics. librarians and
    information workers in the uk are latecomers to the question of
    professional ethics. a us code was developed in 1938, and other
    professions have had codes since the 19th century. the
    overriding reason for such a code is the protection of the
    client, but it also offers protection for the professionals
    themselves, and could enhance the status of the profession. at
    the very heart of the la code is responsive and responsible
    professionalism.
