on the plane weve extinction cross section of an obstacle
    the relation between the extinction cross section of an
    obstacle which both absorbs and scatters power and the
    amplitude and phase of a scattered time harmonic plane wave is
    proved using an explicit representation of the scattered field
    the result is valid for a plane wave with arbitrary elliptic
    polarization
