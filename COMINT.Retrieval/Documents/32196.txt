the worldwide distribution of the f layer electron
    density seasonal and nonseasonal variations and correlations
    with solar activity seasonal and nonseasonal variations of the
    maximum electron density in the f layer at noon are largely
    asymmetrical in the two hemispheres at midnight they are
    symmetrical a general circulation of the upper atmosphere is
    suggested as an explanation for these and other anomalies
