years of citatel'.on the eve of the 30th anniversary, the
    main points of the periodical's history are outlined. it was
    founded with the main purpose of assisting staff in public
    libraries. with time, its impact has spread to all types of
    libraries, in particular in slovakia. librarians have been
    informed of new, inventive ideas, both from home and abroad.
    theory and practice of librarianship in the soviet union has
    always attracted special attention. although the educational
    role of citatel' has been emphasised as the most important one,
    there has always been enough space on its pages to advise
    librarians of improvement in working conditions, and to
    campaign for the establishment of new libraries. today,
    citatel' is well established not only in czechoslovakia, but it
    also has a good reputation abroad, and interest in it is on the
    increase.
