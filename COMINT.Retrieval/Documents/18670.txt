    isometric representation of a space curve prowse of has shown
    that the characteristics of an oscillatory circuit can be
    similarly represented by a three dimensional locus curve whose
    projections on the three reference planes give respectively the
    usual circle diagram a resonance curve and an n shaped
    susceptance diagram wire models on similar lines are described
    which show the relation between impedance and frequency or
    between admittance and frequency for some simple and coupled
    circuits
