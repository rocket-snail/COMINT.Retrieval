magnetic storms and the van allen radiation belts
    observations from satellite explorer fourth a marked decrease
    in intensity of particles in the outer belt was observed during
    magnetic storms it is suggested that this is due to atmospheric
    heating and expansion at fairly high latitudes the absence of
    intensity changes in the inner belt is consistent with a cosmic
    ray albedo neutron origin of inner zone protons
