children's access to library systems. paper presented at
    the 41st conference of the graduate library school, university
    of chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access to services and
    materials in school and public libraries. in order to guarantee
    children access to information, we must' establish the
    appropriate resource-sharing arrangements; grant children the
    right to participate in them; and include children's materials
    and resources in the developing data systems. current studies
    reveal that, although as children reach junior high age they
    use the public library predominantly for school projects,
    neither school nor public libraries are important in the
    child's total pattern of information seeking. lack of
    transportation, time, and school assignments based on library
    resources contribute to this pattern. while multiple
    cooperatives such as those developing in colorado and being
    initiated in new york are of interest and show promise,
    large-scale failure to develop inter- and intralibrary loan
    policies and procedures which include children and young adults
    as users further inhibit access by the young. as of this time,
    little of the massive amount of curricular, historical,
    textual, or literary materials for children are being included
    in developing automated data bases and systems, thus denying
    their access to adults as well as to youth. in fighting the
    battle of access for the young, librarians must develop broader
    competencies in the areas of management and communications
    technology.
