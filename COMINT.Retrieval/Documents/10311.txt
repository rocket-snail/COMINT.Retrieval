modulation distortion in frequency modulation by special
    frequency band the distortion factors are calculated which
    arise in two three or four double tuned critically coupled band
    filters used in f m receivers under the assumption of
    linearized phase characteristics and for two different
    selectivity specifications the amplitudes of combination tones
    are calculated for the case of three filters when two f m
    signals are applied
