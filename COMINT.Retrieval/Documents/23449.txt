the synthesis of reactance networks consisting only of
    rejector circuits in series by the method of partial networks
    the modification required in a filter network with given
    resonance and anti resonance frequencies in order to introduce
    a further prescribed resonance or antiresonance frequency is
    determined numerical examples illustrate the method which is
    also applied to the reduction of the number of resonance
    frequencies and to a mechanical oscillator
