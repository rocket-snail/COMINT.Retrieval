standardisation of information work as a means for
    improvement of the organisation and methodology of scientific
    and technical information departments. 1 of the trends of the
    future development of the ussr state system of scientific and
    technical information is standardisation of information work
    and library tasks. approximately 50 standards are planned to be
    published within the 11th 5-year plan. standards are being
    prepared by a number of information departments attached to
    academic institutions and manufacturing companies, thus the
    preparation of standards is not always sufficiently
    coordinated. an analysis of the standardisation of various
    aspects of information work was therefore carried out. its
    results show that it is essential to prepare an unified plan of
    standardisation covering all aspects of information work.
    methodological recommendations must be prepared in cooperation
    with official bodies of the state system of scientific and
    technical information and particular attention sh ould be paid
    to the terminology used.
