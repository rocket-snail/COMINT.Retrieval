atmospherics with long trains of pulses the waveforms of
    atmospherics having long continued trains of pulses and the
    systematic modifications associated with time of recording
    storm distance and the presence of a low frequency component
    are described their interpretation is discussed and the results
    of analysis assuming the simple ionospheric reflection
    mechanism are presented estimates of reflection height and
    storm distance show the applicability of the theory to the
    temporal parameters of the waveforms and the origins of two
    groups of atmospherics having calculated ranges are considered
    the variation of pulse amplitude with reflection order is shown
    to lead to the channel during the later stages of the return
    stroke although difficulties arise in reconciling this concept
    with considerations of the magnitude and orientation of the
    horizontal elements
