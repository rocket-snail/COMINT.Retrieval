transistors in switching circuits analysis of transistor
    trigger circuits is based on an approximate representation of
    the negative resistance characteristic by three straight lines
    circuits using point contact transistors for waveform
    generation level restoration delay storage and counting are
    described and their properties n and limitations are discussed
    in detail
