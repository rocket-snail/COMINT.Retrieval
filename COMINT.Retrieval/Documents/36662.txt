resistance and frequency variations due to unwanted modes
    in quartz crystals a numerical relation is shown to exist
    between the peak resistance increase and peak frequency
    departure caused by an unwanted mechanically coupled mode the
    value provides a useful means of estimating frequency
    departures and determining whether a particular crystal is
    satisfactory
