criteria for weeding books in a university music library.
    guidelines on weeding of books in a university music library,
    based on experience at the music library of the university of
    california at berkeley, where a sample study was conducted to
    develop quantitative criteria for selecting books for storage.
    measurable information of circulation records, subject,
    language and publication date were used and selection was made
    on the basis of these quantitative means to provide a framework
    for the application of subjective qualitative criteria.
