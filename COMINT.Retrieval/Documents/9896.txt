investigation of high frequency discharge by method of
    probes the methods used by banerji and ganguli were compared
    experimentally the results obtained in the two cases were
    similar a study was also made of the temperature concentration
    of electrons and potential along the axis of the discharge tube
    at various pressures between about and mm hg of and at
    frequencies of the order of the distribution was found to
    depend on the gas pressure the diameter of the tube and the hf
    field strength results are presented graphically
