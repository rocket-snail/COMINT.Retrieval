the role of the network in automated acquisitions.
    contribution to the lita (american library association. library
    and information technology association) institute. examines
    non-profit bibliographic networks to assess why they offer, or
    plan to offer acquisitions services, what major contributions
    they can make, and the advantages and disadvantages of network
    acquisitions systems for individual libraries. networks can
    contribute significantly because cataloguing and acquisitions
    functions are complementary, and the networks can provide both
    acquisitions and in-process control over materials, thus
    allowing a library to operate more efficiently with improved
    internal controls. as a network system will display member
    holdings, cooperative acquisitions and interlibrary loan will
    also be facilitated.
