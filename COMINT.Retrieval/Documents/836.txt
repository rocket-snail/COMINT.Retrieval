the effect of attachment on radio echo observations of
    meteors the observed relation between visual meteor magnitude
    and echo duration is explained by this mechanism as are the
    departures from the wavelength squared variation of echo
    duration predicted by diffusion theory attachment processes
    also account for the observation that the final heights of
    enduring meteor echoes all centre about ninty five km even
    though bright meteors may show a maximum in light intensity
    below eighty km
