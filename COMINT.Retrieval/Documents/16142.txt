the campaign for public libraries in new south wales,
    1929-1950. the period 1890-1930 witnessed a decline in the
    number of public libraries in new south wales but by 1930
    several prominent citizens began to see them as useful adjuncts
    to the campaign to improve australian education. the carnegie
    corporation of new york provided financial support and the free
    library movement was set up in sydney. mass demand for public
    libraries was not really a motive force in the revival. world
    war 2 emphasised the need to preserve democracy through
    education and also established the idea that culture was not
    the preserve of the intellectual elite alone. post-war
    reconstruction brought with it a tide of largely british
    immigrants who had higher expectations of public library
    services. the impetus provided by the war was short lived,
    however, and public libraries were forced to stand alone. this
    time they were able to survive through the professionalism of
    the librarians.
