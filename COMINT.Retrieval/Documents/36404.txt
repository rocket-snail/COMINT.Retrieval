function generator for sines or cosines operation of the
    transistorized unit described is based on the fact that the
    area under a sine curve varies as a cosine function basic
    components required are a linear pulse width modulator an ideal
    switch two pnp transistors connected emitter to emitter an
    integrator and a sine wave source
