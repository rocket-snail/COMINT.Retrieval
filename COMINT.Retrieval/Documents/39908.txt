a commission with possibilities-in spite of all.
    discusses the functions of the public library commission
    (folkbiblioteksutredningen) in sweden after 1 year's work.
    suggests that the commission should formulate not only
    cultural, but also social and educational goals for public
    libraries. it should indicate ways in which libraries in
    cooperation with schools and adult education organisations can
    save the book at a time when aural and visual media threaten to
    take over. to this end the commission has begun to cooperate
    with the cultural council's planned literature campaign in the
    kopparberg region. the commission can contribute to the
    equalisation of services by placing more emphasis on the
    regional library's role in this respect. any extra money should
    be channelled through the regional library.
