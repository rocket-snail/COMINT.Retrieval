radio frequency breakdown controlled by drift of
    electrons in an inhomogeneous magnetic field measurements of
    breakdown rf electron field versus magnetic field were made at
    pressures between and in and the breakdown field varied as the
    inverse square root of the magnetic field as predicted by
    theory
