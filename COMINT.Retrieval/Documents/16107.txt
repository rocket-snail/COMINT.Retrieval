line breadths of the microwave spectrum of oxygen the
    microwave absorption band for consists mainly of lines around
    the wavelength mm with spacings of only a few hundred the
    intensity of the band depends on the variation of line widths
    with pressure this variation is expressed in terms of the line
    breadth parameter defined as the half width measured at half
    intensity of an absorption line at a pressure of atm
    determinations of this parameter made with a zeeman modulation
    spectrograph are reported and discussed and an interpretation
    of the self broadening collision process is developed
    measurements are also reported for broadening due to collisions
    with foreign molecules
