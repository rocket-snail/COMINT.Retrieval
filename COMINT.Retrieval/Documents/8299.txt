alphabetization in indexes: experimental studies.
    discusses the respective advantages of the 'letter by letter'
    and 'word by word' system of alphabetisation, and presents the
    results of several studies of how students and children
    sequence words and retrieve items from indexes with different
    sequences. concludes that students use a variety of methods
    when asked to put words in order for an index, with sense and
    meaning being a prime consideration. schoolchildren, however,
    were found to be less ambitious in this respect, and to order
    words alphabetically using the letter by letter method. no 1
    method of sequencing indexes was found to lead to better
    retrieval than any of the others used, and it appears that
    either of the 2 methods currently used by indexers can be
    employed without causing undue difficulty for young
    readers.
