digital servomechanism controls shaft position devices
    for converting data from digital to analogue form are discussed
    two experimental system which convert binary digital input
    signals into shaft rotation angles are described the converter
    functions as a closed loop servomechanism in which the error
    sensing portion is a digital computer information can be
    indicated remotely with an accuracy within
