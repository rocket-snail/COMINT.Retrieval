the struggle for full implementation of the public
    libraries law-1975 (in hebrew). when the law was passed, it was
    generally understood that the government would finance 75% of
    public library budgets. the situation over the past several
    years has been that an ever-growing percentage of the budget is
    covered by local authorities. this has not only brought about a
    deterioration of public library services, but may lead to a
    situation in which the libraries section of the ministry of
    education and culture will be unable to enforce the high
    standards it has set, since it will not have the necessary
    funds to pass on to local authorities. documents the actions
    and efforts of the committee on the full implementation of the
    public libraries law since its formation in june 78. these
    include correspondence and meetings with senior government and
    parliamentary officials and a public effort to achieve
    implementation, the height of which was a national librarians'
    demonstration before the ministry of e ducation and culture in
    jerusalem in jan 80.
