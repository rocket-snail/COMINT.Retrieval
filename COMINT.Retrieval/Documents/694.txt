this is the way ruc has organised recording of tv.
    describes roskilde university library's videotape collection.
    some recordings were made from the start of the library in
    1971, but they were usually deleted. grants for modern
    video-cassette recorders in 1973 and the new copyright act of
    1977 making it legal to record radio and tv programmes for
    educational use enabled the library to organise recording and
    use in a system parallel to that for books. discusses the legal
    interpretation of who may record, what may be recorded,
    responsibility for possible compensation, free right to lend,
    duty to delete. argues that now that the legal question is
    cleared up, public and research libraries should organise a
    system for acquisition, registration, cataloguing and lending
    of recordings similar to that for books. describes roskilde's
    solution. orders for recording of danish and swedish tv
    programmes are received from staff and students and some
    recording is done on the library's own initiative. after
    recording, registration is done on the basis of the programme
    title. subject entries are made not according to udc, but to
    the library's own estimate of users' needs.
