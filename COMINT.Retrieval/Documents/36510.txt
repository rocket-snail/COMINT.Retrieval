    ionosphere theoretical study on the geomagnetic distortion in
    the layer characteristics of the layer on the magnetic equator
    effect of gravity and ionization pressure gradient on the
    vertical drift in the region world wide observations made
    during the sunspot minimum period and during the second polar
    year are analysed and discussed theoretically the anomalous
    distribution in the region above the magnetic equator may be
    explained by vertical electron drifts caused by the electric
    field an ionospheric model consistent with the results of
    rocket experiments is used the particle density at altitude
    must be of the order of
