meteor echo durations and visual magnitudes the
    statistical relation between the radio echo duration and the
    visual magnitudes was analysed using observations obtained
    during the years on about meteors over a range of magnitudes
    the relation is linear or nearly linear it is inferred that a
    meteor of absolute magnitude produces electrons per of path
    length
