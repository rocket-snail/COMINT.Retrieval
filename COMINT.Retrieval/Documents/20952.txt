microwave method for measuring the probability of elastic
    collision of electrons in a gas a plasma in a dc magnetic field
    has a transverse condductivity component whose reactive part
    depends on the magnetic field by measuring the magnetic field
    necessary to make the reactive part zero the probability of the
    elastic collision of electrons in he is obtained
