electromagnetic fields in a ferromagnetic medium with
    particular reference to harmonic distortion due to hysteresis
    the frequency dependence of the third order distortion factor
    of an inductor at low flux densities is studied theoretically
    an analogue method is described which enables the study to be
    extended experimentally to large flux densities and complex
    input waveforms
