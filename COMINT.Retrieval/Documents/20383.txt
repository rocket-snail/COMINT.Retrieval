ponderomotive force in localized plasma in the
    electromagnetic field of a plane wave a sphere of uniformly
    ionized gas is considered as a rough model of localized plasma
    the radius of this sphere is smaller than the wavelength of the
    field in vacuum or in plasma expressions for the internal and
    surface intensities of the ponderomotive force are
    derived
