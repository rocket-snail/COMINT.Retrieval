children's literature and libraries in mali' problems and
    development. lecture given at the ifla/unesco seminar in
    leipzig, aug 81. in pre-colonial times education in mali was
    provided within the family; in the colonial periods, the
    mediaeval berbers and 19th century french established some
    schools and libraries. between 1960 and 1980, after
    independence, the education system was reformed and a literacy
    campaign promoted in the country's 4 main languages. since the
    1970s 46 public libraries have been opened, each of which
    contains a children's department. keypoints in the development
    of children's libraries are the production of suitable
    literature, stock expansion and staff training, a programme
    coordinated by the central library for children's literature in
    bamako. librarians, authors and publishers are working together
    to make collections of national legends and stories, organise
    cultural events and encourage library use.
