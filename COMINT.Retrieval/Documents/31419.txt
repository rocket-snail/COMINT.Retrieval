theory of the effect of drag on the orbital inclination
    of an earth satellite it is assumed that the drag is in the
    direction of the air velocity relative to the satellite and
    that its magnitude diminishes so rapidly with altitude that it
    is appreciable only near perigee in an elliptic orbit results
    are deduced for the secular changes in inclination up to but
    not including the final ballistic stage
