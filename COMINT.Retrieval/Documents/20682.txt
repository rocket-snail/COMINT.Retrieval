a ferroelectric amplifier a lf signal was applied to a
    capacitor with ceramic dielectric thereby causing its
    capacitance to vary the capacitor formed part of a tuned
    circuit fed by a hf voltage the resulting am hf voltage was
    applied to a detector circuit to recover the signal analysis
    for this arrangement indicates the conditions for maximum
    amplification with a signal frequency of hf of and load
    resistance a power gain of was obtained with the signal source
    removed and the output fed back to the input terminals
    sustained lf oscillations were obtained with only the hf
    voltage applied the oscillation frequency could be varied
    continuously from to by varying the value of a rf choke in the
    input lead and of a capacitor in the detector circuit see also
