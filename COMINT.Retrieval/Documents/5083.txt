the 1st academic library of siberia (the 100th
    anniversary of the scientific library of the tomsk university).
    reviews the history and development and discusses the current
    work of the scientific library of tomsk university. when
    founded, in 1880, the library had a stock of approximately
    96,000 items consisting of valuable collections of books, which
    were either purchased or which the library received as gifts.
    initially the use was not very effective: during its first 10
    years the library handled on average only 5,000 loans per year.
    staff worked under extremely difficult conditions during the
    period 1941-44 when a herbarium and a museum were moved into
    its premises. in addition, during that period the library
    looked after the archives of a.m. gor'kii, l.n. tolstoi and
    a.s. pushkin. despite the difficult conditions, staff not only
    managed to continue their work but the library also provided a
    service to wounded soldiers receiving treatment in tomsk. the
    library has currently a stock of 3, 5 million items in more
    than 50 languages and an extensive collection of periodicals.
    in 1969 the library became a methodological centre for 46
    academic libraries. it organises over 300 book exhibitions a
    year.
