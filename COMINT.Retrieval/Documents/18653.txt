nonlinear phenomena in a plasma located in an alternating
    electro magnetic field a detailed treatment of elementary and
    kinetic theories of a nonrelativistic nondegenerate plasma in a
    uniform electric field with particular reference to the
    distribution function of electron collisions the el effective
    electron temperature and total electric current density results
    are applied to determine the nonlinear effects occurring in the
    in the propagation of radio waves in the ionosphere including
    self interaction cross modulation and the interaction of
    unmodulated waves
