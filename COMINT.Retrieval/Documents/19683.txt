backward wave microwave oscillations in a system composed
    of an electron beam and a hydrogen gas plasma a travelling wave
    interaction structure is used to investigate the properties of
    a low density plasma microwave oscillations near the electron
    cyclotron frequency are observed as the result of growing waves
    in a beam plasma interaction electron ction electron densities
    determined by observing the correlation between the measured
    frequencies of oscillation and the theoretical predictions of
    trivelpiece and gould of are verified by observation of the
    shift in the resonance frequency of a microwave cavity
    containing the plasma
