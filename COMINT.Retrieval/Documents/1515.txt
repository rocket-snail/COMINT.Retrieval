a two state light activated circuit element using
    germanium a bar of n type germanium with a potential difference
    across its ends and a suitably biased point contact near the
    middle will show double base diode action the point contact
    diode will conduct or cease to conduct according as one end or
    the other of the bar is illuminated both states being stable
    when the light is removed in practice the bar is divided near
    the point contact and the two parts are connected by copper
    wire to ensure that holes generated in one section recombine
    before they are swept into the other
