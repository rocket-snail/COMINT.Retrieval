longitudinal waves in an ionized medium plasma the
    permittivity of an electronic plasma is calculated taking
    account of electron motion the value found depends on the
    spatial structure of the field a concept of spatial dispersion
    is introduced the properties of longitudinal waves and their
    relation to transverse waves are investigated
