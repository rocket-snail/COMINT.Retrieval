charged particle variations in the outer van allen zone
    during a geomagnetic storm fluctuations in the particle fluxes
    and local magnetic field were observed by explorer at km during
    the geomagnetic storm of august and found to be correlated the
    numbers of low energy particles decreased and high energy
    particles increased the results are consistent with the
    theories of dessler an parker of
