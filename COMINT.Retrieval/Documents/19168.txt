on the measurement of the average time delay in secondary
    emission the time delay of the secondary emission is measured
    by comparing the duration of short bursts of primary emission
    with the duration of the corresponding bursts of secondary
    emission the primary bursts are produced by deflecting a beam
    across an aperture at high speed while the secondary beam is
    scanned over eg a fluorescent screen the duration of the
    secondary pulses is longer than that of the primaries by an
    amount which depends on the accelerating voltage
