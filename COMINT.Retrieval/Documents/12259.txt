an access control facility for relational data base
    systems. a set of language facilities for the specification of
    security policy in relational data bases is presented. an
    integrated approach to the description of the data base, access
    rights of users, and use of data is based on the hypol
    language. generic rights or types of access are defined over
    the domains of the data base whereas data base operations are
    over the entire relation. language facilities are described to
    produce a static definition of the capabilities of users with
    the incorporation of changes. the appendix lists the syntactic
    definitions of language constructs used. hypol language
    facilities are then contrasted with ims for hierarchical data
    bases, dbtg for network and relational data bases, and ingres
    and system r for relational data bases.
