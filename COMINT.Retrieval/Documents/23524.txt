on the question of charging for public library services.
    a statement from the deutscher bibliotheksverband (german
    library association.) the charges under discussion are for the
    loan of books, periodicals and other media, and do not refer to
    special services such as photocopying. the association is
    strongly opposed to charges being made for basic services which
    it regards as a retrograde step that could only harm the public
    library service and detract from its educational and social
    value in the community. the detrimental effects far outweigh
    any possible financial gain.
