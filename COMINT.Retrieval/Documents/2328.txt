hamburg public libraries-draft development plan. the 10
    year plan, published in oct 81, concentrates on the public
    sector and looks at library provision in the city in the light
    of the ever-increasing output of books and non-book materials
    and of hamburg's growing immigrant population. developments in
    library provision have not kept pace with demand, particularly
    for special categories (e.g. handicapped people). ways of
    cooperation between libraries and library systems and the
    relationship between school and public libraries needs
    reappraisal. the role of the branch library in meeting the
    special needs of the local community must be examined and
    better accommodation is needed if the service is to expand. the
    introduction of computer techniques should release staff to
    expand the scope of the service.
