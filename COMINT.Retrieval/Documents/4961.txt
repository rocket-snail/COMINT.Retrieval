    library institute's committee on central catalogues was
    disbanded in 1980 and, to ensure continuity of its work, a
    standing conference on central catalogues was established,
    meeting 3 times a year. work continues on transferring central
    catalogues to microfiches, and the catalogues of bavaria and
    north-rhineland westphalia are being added in 1981. the
    standardisation of procedures for national and international
