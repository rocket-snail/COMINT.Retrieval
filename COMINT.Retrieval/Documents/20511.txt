    paper presented at the 54th aslib annual conference,
    information '81' forecasts and realities, oxford university,
    uk, 22-25 sept 81. the true cost of obtaining and producing
    information is frequently hidden or distorted through the
    existence of a system in which public and private sectors do
    not always complement each other and may even be in open
    competition. looks at the amount of money spent on information
    around the world and discusses the value of information. to
    charge for information one way or another is unavoidable. urges
    a reduced involvement of the uk government in information
    activities peripheral to supporting the main functions of
    government and argues that with the stimulation of innovation
    through competitive market forces, the quality and relevance of
    information products would greatly increase.
