information flow among engineers in a design company.
    (phd thesis-university of illinois at urbana-champaign.) study
    of the way technical information flows through formal and
    informal channels among engineers in a design company.
    engineers' information needs were identified, and their
    behaviour while searching for information, or while obtaining
    it by chance, was analysed. it was found that the information
    channels, both formal and informal, interact in a complex way,
    although following specific patterns, and that they complement
    each other during the process of information
    acquisition.
