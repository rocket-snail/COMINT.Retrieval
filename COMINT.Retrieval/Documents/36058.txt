the cryotron a superconductive computer component the
    study of nonlinearities in nature suitable for computer use has
    led to the cryotron a device based on the destruction of
    superconductivity by a magnetic field the cryotron in its
    simplest form consists of a straight piece of wire about one
    inch long with a single layer control winding wound over it
    current in the control winding creates a magnetic field which
    causes the central wire to change from its superconducting
    state to its normal state the device has current gain that is a
    small current can control a larger current it has power gain so
    that cryotrons can be interconnected in logical networks as
    active elements the device is also small light easily
    fabricated and dissipates very little power
