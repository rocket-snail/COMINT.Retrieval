on the bearing of ionospheric radio waves systematic
    measurements of bearings obtained by means of special df
    equipment of february et al are analysed and fluctuations are
    interpreted with regard to propagation modes and distance when
    the great circle muf exceeds the signal frequency the mean
    bearing coincides with the direction of the transmitter aerial
    but deviates considerably when the great circle muf falls below
    the signal frequency the changes are attributed to a major
    deviation from the great circle path combined with a final
    scatter hop from continental land masses deviation of anti
    podal signal bearings are explained assuming that the signals
    follow paths of low absorption night zones
