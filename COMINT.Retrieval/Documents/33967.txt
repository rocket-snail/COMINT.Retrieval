a comparison of overlap: eric and psychological
    abstracts. in nov 78, the university of minnesota education
    library investigated the overlap of the eric and psychological
    abstracts on-line data bases, performing the same 4 searches on
    both. discusses the results and suggests that when budget
    restrictions force a choice to be made between the 2, the
    searcher should' consider the end user's discipline-education
    or psychology; use eric for topics dealing with the 'normal'
    population, practical applications, and applied settings; use
    psychological abstracts for material on 'abnormal' or
    'disturbed' populations, clinical settings, and non-us topics;
    remember that eric is easier to search manually than the other;
    and consider their non-journal coverage.
