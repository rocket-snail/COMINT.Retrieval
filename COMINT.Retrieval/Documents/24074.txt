transition radiation in a waveguide investigation of the
    radiation which arises in a waveguide by the passage of a
    charged particle through the boundary between two media at
    ultrarelativistic charge velocities the radiation is mainly in
    the forward direction and its magnitude is proportional to the
    particle energy formulae for the total energy of the radiation
    and its spectral distribution are derived
