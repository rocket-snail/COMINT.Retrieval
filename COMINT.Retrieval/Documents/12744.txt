direct measurement of charged particles associated with
    auroral zone radio absorption rocket observations of electrons
    with energy and protons with energy are described during ascent
    the electron flux showed large and rapid fluctuations which are
    consistent with a columnar structure while the proton intensity
    was relatively steady an estimate is made of the integral
    electron energy spectrum and the angular distribution of both
    electrons and protons are examined
