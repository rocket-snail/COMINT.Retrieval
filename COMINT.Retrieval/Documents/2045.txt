a conversation with celeste west. an interview with
    celeste west covering her library training at rutgers
    university and work for san francisco public library at the bay
    area reference center (barc). she edited the library journal
    2synergy1 which evolved out of experience gained at barc but
    state funding was withdrawn because it was too political. she
    set up 2booklegger magazine1, a feminist, radical library
    journal, with other women and now publishes books under the
    booklegger imprint.
