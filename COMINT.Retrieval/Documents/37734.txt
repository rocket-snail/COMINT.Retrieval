a resonance phenomenon in electrodeless hf gas discharges
    with superposed magnetic field experiments in atmospheres of h
    and ar are described which show that the resonance effect
    previously noted of koch and neuert is associated with a sharp
    drop between two peaks in the intensity of the emitted light it
    occurs always at the same value of the field strength
