the nonlinearity of titanate capacitors ferroelectric and
    ferromagnetic materials are compared and expressions for the
    specific nonlinearity are derived for both these expressions
    give the hysteresis loss cm referred to unity circular
    frequency and a reactive power of the specific nonlinearities
    of material with a dielectric constant of and ferrite with an
    initial permeability of the same order of magnitude
