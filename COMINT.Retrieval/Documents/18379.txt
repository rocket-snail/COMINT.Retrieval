the relation between the geomagnetic field and range
    disturbance in various latitudes analysis of observations leads
    to a theory of the mechanism of magnetic disturbances
    intermediate between the classical theory and tht advanced by
    nikolsky of the true storm time effect is greatest at the
    equator an additional effect comprising instantaneous response
    to and recovery from the disturbance is greatest in the auroral
    zone the effect on the ionosphere at high latitudes is briefly
    considered
