an experiment in classification: based on william
    goffman's 'indirect method' of information retrieval. based on
    a paper prepared for a classification theory course at case
    western reserve university, ohio, a revised version of which
    was presented at a canadian classification research group
    conference, london, ontario, may 78. describes an investigation
    into the subject characteristics of document classes retrieved
    using goffman's indirect method; how these classes are similar
    to, or different from, the classes obtained when a faceted
    classification system is applied to the same set of documents;
    and the characteristics of the clusters of terms which
    inter-relate a definable class of documents. a random sample of
    101 entries in the subject indexing section of 2lisa1, 1976,
    were used. the results indicate that the indirect method could
    have some merit in search strategies in computerised
    information storage and retrieval systems based on keywords or
    a controlled vocabulary.
