electric field induced by vertical component of
    geomagnetic variations an expression is derived for the
    horizontal electric fiel in the earth due to a varying
    geomagnetic field assuming regions of unequal electrical
    conductivities graphs based on published experimental
    determinations of the electric field components and the
    geomagnetic field show typical hour cycles and indicate the
    degree of correlation between the electric and geomagnetic
    fields see also of
