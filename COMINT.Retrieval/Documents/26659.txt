an all year round children's book week. in the
    netherlands the annual children's book week is organised by
    publishers and booksellers to promote the sale of children's
    books. librarians, however, should aim at all year round
    stimulation of children's reading interests. working groups can
    be formed in each community with representatives from the local
    public library and other interested organisations to provide a
    programme of library activities for children. such activities
    may be arranged with local schools as part of the school
    timetable or may be provided outside school hours. activities
    may include reading of 1 or more set books, writing short
    stories and poetry, and providing illustrations to a set book.
    children who have participated in such programmes of library
    activities are more likely to become regular library
    users.
