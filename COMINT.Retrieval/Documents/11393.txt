effects of solar flares on the absorption of cosmic noise
    abnormal variations of ionospheric absorption were investigated
    during the course of the observations reported previously of
    most cases of unusually high absorption appear to be associated
    with solar flares observations of the increases in absorption
    during the resulting sudden ionospheric disturbances are
    compared with observations of sudden phase anomalies in waves
    rn waves reflected from the ionosphere a db absorption
    difference appears to correspond to a phase anomaly of about at
    the frequency considered as a method of detecting sudden
    ionospheric disturbances observation of the absorption
    variation variation is as sensitive as and more convenient than
    observation of phase anomalies evidence was found of a delayed
    increase of absorption about hours after some solar flares the
    magnetic records sshowed no abnormal features at these times
    and it is uncertain whether the excess absorption occurs within
    the ionosphere or outside it
