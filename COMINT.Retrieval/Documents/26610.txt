the electric strength of air in nonuniform fields at
    radio frequencies measurements were made of the breakdown
    potential of atmospheric air between a cylinder and an axial
    wire over the frequency range the breakdown voltage is about
    below the value at and decreases at the average rate of per as
    the frequency is raised above this point the results are
    explained by a modified townsend theory the discharge occurs
    during the part of the cycle when the wire is positive with
    respect to the cylinder
