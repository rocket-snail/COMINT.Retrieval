interpretation of cosmic noise measurements at from
    satellite and the analysis given is based on the assumption
    that observed variations in signal strength were due to three
    causes variation of radiation resistance o the aerial with the
    dielectric constant of the surrounding ionosphere restriction
    of the angular aperture at the aerial due to ionospheric
    refraction and polarization and variation of cosmic noise power
    over the sky
