author cocitation: a literature measure of intellectual
    structure. shows that the mapping of a particular area of
    science, in this case information science, can be done using
    authors as units of analysis and the cocitations of pairs of
    authors as the variable that indicates their 'distances' from
    each other. the analysis assumes that the more 2 authors are
    cited together, the closer the relationship between them. the
    raw data are cocitation counts drawn on-line from social
    scisearch (2social sciences citation index1) over the period
    1972-79. cocitation analysis of authors offers a new technique
    that might contribute to the understanding of intellectual
    structure in the sciences and possibly in other areas to the
    extent that those areas rely on serial publications.
