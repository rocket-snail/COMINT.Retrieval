the support of adult education and training. the arrival
    of new plant at the petrochemical combine at schwedt meant that
    retraining for some staff and more advanced training for others
    had to be carried out. the trade union library at the works had
    to participate by acquiring multiple copies and class sets of
    some books and discarding outdated material. the library
    obtained textbooks requested by the industrial training school,
    checking available material and filling in gaps in subject
    coverage. all students were provided with leaflets describing
    library facilities. as a result loans in 1980 totalled 42,400,
    compared with 35,065 for 1979. similar arrangements were made
    for the library to provide the material needed for political
    education.
