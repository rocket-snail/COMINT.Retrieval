the contribution of the university library towards the
    education and training of students. the results are presented
    of a pilot survey carried out at the humboldt university in
    berlin. the 60 students interviewed stressed that personal
    contact between lecturer and student was the most important aid
    to education, when advice on reading and work methods could be
    given; they also valued reading suggestions from other
    students. at least 1/2 the students interviewed found the
    library staff helpful in providing guidance on literature
    study. the library was a good place for working, although
    delays in obtaining books sometimes held up the study
    programme. some students felt that concentration on
    examinations impeded the growth of creative ability. close
    contact between lecturers and librarians is essential for the
    improvement of stocks and study methods.
