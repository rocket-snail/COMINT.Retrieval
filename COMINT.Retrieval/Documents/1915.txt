the measurement of ionospheric absorption using
    observations of cosmic radio noise ionospheric absorption is
    specified by the ratio expressed in decibels of p the received
    cosmic noise power to p the power that would have been received
    in the absence of absorption from about a years observations of
    cosmic noise a standard curve of sidereal time can be drawn for
    all aerial directions analysis of records made at hornsby nsw
    from june to show that two main components due to absorption in
    the f and d regions respectively can be distinguished
