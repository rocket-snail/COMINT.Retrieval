the minister has been led astray. the contribution by a
    member of the danish library association's executive committee
    to a debate on school libraries held at the danish school
    library association's annual meeting, oct 81. argues that the
    ministry of culture in its library bill has disregarded the
    library commission's proposals for school libraries. although
    research libraries were not included in the 1964 library act, a
    unified library system was brought about with the inclusion of
    school libraries. the ideal of unity is now being set aside.
    but if the school libraries are to be transferred to the
    schools, the minimum demand to ensure their existence must be
    by-laws governing their relationship to public libraries and a
    separate budget. these requirements were confirmed by the
    minister of culture. yet the library bill makes no mention of
    them and reduces the separate budget to an accounting item in
    the local authority finances. the bill is, therefore, totally
    unacceptable to the danish li brary association.
