the patent system and the medium-sized industry.
    shortened version of a lecture at the 6th international
    symposium on small and medium-sized enterprises (issb
    symposium), berlin, 30 oct 79. the majority of patent
    applications in west germany are filed by small and
    medium-sized industries (smi) or private inventors. many smi,
    however, do not make full use of the protection offered by
    patenting and they have only recently acknowledged the
    importance of patent literature as a source of technical
    information. analyses some explanations for this; outlines the
    advantages of patent protection; and concludes that the west
    german patent office should make access to its stock of
    information easier and more effective.
