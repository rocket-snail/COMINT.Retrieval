private videotex systems and gateway link to public
    services. private videotex systems for corporate in-house use,
    and for closed user groups, are attracting increasing
    attention. at the same time, advances are occurring in the
    field of publicly-available videotex network design, where the
    trend is towards connecting independent external computers into
    public packet networks for access by videotex subscribers
    through gateway links in the network. in the future, there will
    be a convergence between private videotex systems for corporate
    use, and external computers connected to public videotex
    networks.
