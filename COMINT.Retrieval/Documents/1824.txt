some geomagnetic phenomena associated with nuclear
    explosions magnetograms recorded at three station in the
    immediate area of the explosion on show no disturbance of the h
    component of the earths field at the time of major disturbances
    in z and d components vector diagrams of the disturbance in the
    vertical plane at the three stations are compared with those
    for the explosion on and are found to be markedly similar
    despite the different geographical positions and altitudes of
    the two events in the latter event changes in the h component
    were comparable with those in z and d
