the computation of coils for producing uniform magnetic
    fields and constant field gradients calculations for helmholtz
    coil systems are presented for the field at the mid point on
    the axis to be uniform the second derivative of the field in
    the axial direction must be zero at that point for the field
    gradient to be constant the third derivative must vanish
    families of curves suitable for design purposes are
    derived
