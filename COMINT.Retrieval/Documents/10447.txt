constant resistance modulators zobels constant resistance
    networks are interpreted in terms of constancy with time when
    the elements of the network are time variable and
    simultaneously in the same network the original conception of
    constancy with frequency when the elements are frequency
    variable may be realized the application to rectifier
    modulators is examined
