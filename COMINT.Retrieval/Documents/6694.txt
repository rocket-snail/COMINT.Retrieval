    libraries can be designed to create an ambience which appeals
    to as many people as possible to insure cross-section support
    in the recession. describes: how to use entrances to attract
    potential users; how to use space effectively; how to create
    assignable space; comfortable seating; avoiding crowding and
    barriers; flexible design for technological change. as excess
    space, due to the adoption of computerised systems, becomes
    available, it should be used for nontraditional purposes to
    attract new users.
