some thoughts in the form of a diary. presents personal
    views on recent professional activities. with reference to a
    study day on 'shocking books', criticises the method of
    investigation chosen, a questionnaire on 25 selected titles
    distributed to librarians, as ambiguous, and proposes instead
    that user responses to a less restricted selection of books be
    investigated. secondly discusses the place of cultural
    activities in public libraries in relation to a study day on
    this theme, arguing that the library's priority is to provide
    satisfactory documentation and information services; other
    activities are only of secondary importance, and should be
    considered as publicity strategies rather than actual user
    services.
