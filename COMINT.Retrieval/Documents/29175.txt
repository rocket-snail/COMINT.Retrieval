biblio-data' the data bank at the german national
    library. biblio-data has developed since 1975 into the biggest
    literature data bank for on-line searching in west germany. by
    dec 81 it was linked to 66 institutions in germany and other
    european countries and had access via the stairs retrieval
    system to euronet diane. over 900,000 documentary units are
    available and 100,000 are added annually. the data bank aims to
    include references to all new german monographs and
    periodicals, although not to periodical articles, and retrieval
    is possible via all important data elements. in service quality
    and quantity biblio-data is ahead of most printed
    bibliographies; a special feature is a large store of
    dissertations from both east and west germany. corrections,
    however, cannot yet be made and some aspects of cataloguing
    require improvement.
