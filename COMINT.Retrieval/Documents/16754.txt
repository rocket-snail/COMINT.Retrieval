operation of a solid state quantum mechanical amplifier
    the operation of an s band solid state quantum mechanical
    amplifier operated at with a computed noise temperature of less
    than is compared with similar devices and is used as proof of
    the condition of discrete phonon saturation which has been
    previously postulated see also of june
