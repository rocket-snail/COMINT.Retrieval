on the programme for library research. comments on the
    report by the library school's working party on a programme for
    library research, published autumn 80. the report shows lack of
    classification principles and clear definitions. thus the terms
    library research and library science are used interchangeably.
    the organisation of library research is not discussed, and how
    research at the school can be linked to ongoing field research
    is hardly dealt with. organizational contact with goteborg
    university, as suggested, is not enough, links should also be
    established with other research institutions and with the
    centre for interdisciplinary studies. the suggested appointment
    of a documentalist to document information on library research
    is praised. the programme should be sent to libraries and
    research institutions for discussion before decisions are
    made.
