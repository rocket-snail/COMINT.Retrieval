relaxation oscillations and noise from low current arc
    discharges noise measurements were made on arcs using various
    electrode materials and gases over the frequency range the
    results for al electrodes in air are plotted in comparison with
    the computed spectrum pulses generated in the circuit formed by
    the series limiting resistor and the capacitance across the
    discharge are considered responsible for most of the
    noise
