calculations and measurements for the optimum design of
    low noise transistor amplifiers the conditions for making the
    transistor noise factor a minimum are calculated for white
    noise equations are given for the most favourable combination
    of source impedance and emitter current measurements were made
    of these optimum values as a function of various transistor
    parameters and of temperatures
