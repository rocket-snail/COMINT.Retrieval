matching commitments to needs and resources. revised
    version of a lecture given at the university of tennessee
    library, 29 apr 80. offers practical advice to librarians on
    managing libraries during a time of declining resources. urges
    librarians to put aside the extravagant promises and empty
    rhetoric that characterised the 1960s and 1970s and to take a
    more realistic view of the collections and services they can
    provide to their users during the austere 1980s.
