baker's strategy flounders. a critical analysis of the
    progress made by the uk's minister for information technology
    kenneth baker during his 1st year of office, including
    information technology year. looks particularly at plans for
    education and training and list projects of 1981. without the
    political muscle of a full ministry with its own budget and
    influence in the cabinet, everything baker tries to do will
    inevitably be tactical rather than strategic, and responsive
    rather than truly initiating.
