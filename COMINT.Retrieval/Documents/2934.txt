ge eralized operators for the approximate steady state
    analysis of linear and nonlinear circuits the method is a
    periodic analogue of the time series technique by which
    waveforms are represented by an component operator giving
    values at each of ordinates a shift operator translates any
    waveform by of the appropriate sample period for linear
    circuits the method is advantageous wher ethe periodic input is
    known and a similar description of the output is required
    without recourse to fourier analysis for nonlinear circuits the
    output is obtained by a series of approximations applied to the
    steady state condition
