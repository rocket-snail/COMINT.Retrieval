negative oxygen ions in the upper atmosphere the affinity
    and radiative attachment coefficient of atomic oxygen the
    influence of negative ions of atomic oxygen on the physics of
    the ionosphere and night airglow is re examined in the light of
    new experimental determinations of the oxygen affinity and
    photodetachment cross section the radiative attachment
    coefficient is calculated from th photodetachment cross section
    there is no evidence of a resonance at the threshold where the
    attachment coefficient is approximately
