north african jewish periodicals as a field of study-the
    state of the art. the author recently compiled an inventory of
    north african jewish periodicals found in 4 major jerusalem
    collections. while preparing this 1st listing of 145 titles, he
    encountered several problems, which he shares with librarians.
    firstly, there were often discrepancies between holdings listed
    in the catalogue and actual collections, which only a
    first-hand check of each issue could rectify. moreover, the
    catalogue is not a satisfactory source for changes of editors,
    managers-or even subtitles and other titles (often appearing in
    other languages). the central zionist archives posed a special
    problem' newspapers as a rule are transferred to its library
    collection, but some issues of short-lived zionist periodicals
    were appended to correspondence and remain in the archival
    collection, without being listed in the library
    catalogue.
