radio interferometry of discrete sources salient features
    of the theory and practice of radio interferometry are
    presented with special attention to assumptions and to the
    specifically two dimensional aspects of the subject a theorem
    is proved according to which only certain discrete stations on
    a rectangular lattice need be occupied for full determination
    of a discrete source distribution procedures in interferometry
    are discussed in the light of this result and an optimum
    procedure is deduced current practice is considered over
    conservative eg independent data in the case of the sun are
    obtainable only at station spacings of about wavelengths on the
    ground a fact which has not hitherto been taken into
    account
