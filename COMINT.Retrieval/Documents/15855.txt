operating conditions of the symmetrical multivibrator an
    approximate method for the division of a multidimensional phase
    space into sub spaces is described and applied to analyse the
    operation of a symmetrical multivibrator taking account of
    parasitic capacitance and grid current three modes of operation
    are considered
