a contribution to the theory of the motion of weak
    irregularities in the ionosphere if diffusion is neglected any
    one dimensional irregularity travels unchanged with a constant
    velocity which depends on the magnitude and direction of the
    ionospheric e s and magnetostatic fields in the same way a weak
    two dimensioal irregularity which is parallel to the direction
    of the magneto static field travels with a constant velocity
    and preserves its shape more complicated irregularities do not
    preserve their shape
