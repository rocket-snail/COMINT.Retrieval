audio frequency filters using negative feedback the
    operation is described of a two valve amplifier with a series
    resonance circuit across the cathode impedance of each of the
    two valves and a parallel resonance circuit in the anode
    circuit of the first valve a band pass filter with a flat
    topped response curve is obtained by adjusting the resonance
    frequency of the cathode circuit of the second valve to be
    intermediate to the cathode circuit and anode circuit resonance
    frequencies of the first valve
