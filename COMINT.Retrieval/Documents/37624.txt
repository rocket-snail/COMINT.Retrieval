tantalum solid electrolytic capacitors a capacitor with
    low volume capacitance ratio is obtain ed by forming a layer of
    on a porous ta anode and then depositing a number of coatings
    of to form a solid electrolyte the unit is further coated with
    graphite and a layer of alloy is sprayed on to form the cathode
    temperature frequency and life characteristics are
    reported
