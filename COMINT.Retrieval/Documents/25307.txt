the formation of the sporadic e layer in the temperature
    zones a hypothesis for e formation based on the observation
    that e occurrence is correlated with the horizontal intensity
    of the earths field see of if the horizontal wind varies
    vertically the horizontal field will produce vertical motion of
    electrons ad ions an accumulation of electrons will occur at
    the height for which the vertical velocity passes through zero
    the theory also accounts for the persistence of e
