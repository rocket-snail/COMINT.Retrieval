    setting the transfluxor is a device comprising a magnetic core
    with two or more apertures the core material having a nearly
    rectangular hysteresis loop switching and storage operations
    are performed by controlled transfer of the flux from leg to
    leg of the core the operation of a two aperture device is
    described in detail
