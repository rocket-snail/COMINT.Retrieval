low frequency noise in the range continuation of
    previously noted investigations of and of the correlation
    between lf em fluctuations and geomagnetic and solar phenomena
    a pickup loop with an effective area of was used with an
    amplifier having a gain of and a recorder with chart speed of
    an operating site with low noise characteristics was chosen
    evidence was obtained of frequent storms in the noise frequency
    range studied a diurnal variation similar to that of the
    cheltenham k indices was observed analysis indicates
    significant correlation between the lf noise and solar noise
