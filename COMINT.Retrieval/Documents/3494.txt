fused quartz ultrasonic delay line memory the digit
    storage unit described is of the type comprising a slab of
    fused quartz providing a folded transmission path methods are
    indicated for eliminating spreading of the ultrasonic beam and
    mode conversion at the reflecting surfaces thus reducing the
    intensity of spurious signals an ultrasonic frequency of is
    used and pulses with a dynamic range of can be stored at
    rates
