electron density fluctuations and scattering of radio
    waves in the ionosphere discussion of theoretical and
    experimental determinations of electron density fluctuations
    and of energy scattered at vhf indicates that in vertical
    incidence soundings at frequencies below the critical frequency
    the scattered field is chiefly due to waves first scattered in
    the forward direction and then reflected from higher levels in
    the ionosphere
