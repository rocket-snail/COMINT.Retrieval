some effects of the fine structure of the ionosphere on
    transmission received from the russian earth satellite
    anomalies in doppler observations of the satellite are
    discussed it appears practicable to make a detailed study of
    the lower boundary of the f region by an analysis of doppler
    frequency discontinuities in conjunction with accurately known
    orbit parameters
