has the 'in-house' syndrome gone too far?. the 1959
    national printing strike forced many companies and
    organisations to install in-house printing units, and many
    later added microform units. the low average quality of
    microform produced and the poor economic viability of such
    units, suggest that perhaps in these times of recession and
    increasing competition it would be advantageous for many large
    organisations to cut back on such luxuries and start to support
    small local service businessmen more.
