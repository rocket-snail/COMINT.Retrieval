international and regional cooperation in social science
    documentation. international cooperation in social science
    documentation (covering in the widest sense all activities
    relating to the collection, processing and transfer of
    information) is essential, yet the very nature of the
    information creates obstacles to cooperation. many different
    ways of establishing cooperation have been attempted and
    constant progress is being made at all levels. one of the 1st
    tasks facing these contemplating cooperation is to improve
    reciprocal information on possible subjects for cooperation and
    on the means at their disposal. they should then exchange
    materials, information, ideas, and projects. if further
    cooperation is proposed, joint objectives could be achieved,
    networks established, and moves towards international
    standardisation initiated.
