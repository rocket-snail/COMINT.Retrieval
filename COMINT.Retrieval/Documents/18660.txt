wide range operation of grid controlled rectifiers a
    method of controlling thyratron conduction over a wide range
    from a dc control signal is described and the steady state
    characteristics of a dc power amplifier employing this method
    of control in a bi phase rectifier circuit are discussed and
    experimental results t given
