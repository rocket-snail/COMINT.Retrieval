diffraction of electromagnetic waves by a metallic wedge
    of acute dihedral angle an investigation is made of the field
    produced by reflections within the space included between two
    plane condductors set at an angle experimental and theoretical
    results are given for angles of and discussion indicates that
    the field pattern for angles which are integral fractions of
    can be computed on the basis of geometrical optics
