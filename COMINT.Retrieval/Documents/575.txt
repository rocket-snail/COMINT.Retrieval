a note on the evaluation of the response of a nonlinear
    element to sinusoidal and random signals a method is developed
    based upon a mathematical technique described by lewis which is
    particularly useful for the analysis of nonlinear control
    systems simple cursors may be constructed to determine the
    effective gain of the nonlinear unit the application to
    hysteretic nonlinearities and the response to random signals is
    illustrated
