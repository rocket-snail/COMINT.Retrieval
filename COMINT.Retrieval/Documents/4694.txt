information use by teachers in a junior school. the
    problem of communication between research and practice in
    education derives in part from a lack of knowledge of how
    teachers use educational information in practice. a case study
    of the staff of 1 junior school was set up to collect detailed
    evidence on individual teachers' information use, the informal
    flow of information between teachers, and the impact of new
    information on both school and teacher. although still in
    progress, the analysis has so far produced a preliminary model
    of the utilisation process in the school, indicating its
    complexity and the range of factors involved.
