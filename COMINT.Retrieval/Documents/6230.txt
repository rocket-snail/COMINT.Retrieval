a new ionosphere sounder frequency sweep apparatus
    covering the range is described the aerial circuit is
    eliminated the high impedance rhombic aerial being directly
    matched to the power valves the frequency range is covered in
    the other circuits in two wavebands each with a ratio quick
    waveband changing is achieved by means of carbon brushes
    rotating with the variable capacitors the transmitter and
    receiver have a common oscillator the power supply arrangements
    are particularly described the unit is of small size
