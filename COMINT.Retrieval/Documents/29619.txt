public library research. interview with n. moore, project
    officer in charge of public library research at the british
    library. defines research as theoretical research, which
    provides general background information on libraries and their
    users, and research which seeks to solve specific problems and
    help librarians provide better services. public libraries are
    mainly interested in the latter. recent research has begun to
    look at why people use public libraries and the results are
    being used to improve services. the british library supports
    research investigating resource distribution, cooperation and
    staff organisation in public libraries and examining the role
    of public libraries in relation to further education. this
    research is as far as possible carried out by practising
    librarians, often in conjunction with the library schools. the
    british library also finances research centres, which initiate
    research, build up collections of resource material and advise
    researchers. an advisory comm ittee on public library research
    helps the british library coordinate research.
