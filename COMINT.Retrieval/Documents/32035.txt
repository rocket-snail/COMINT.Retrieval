walter hofmann's and rudolf angermann's contribution to
    the development of the methods of reader research. part 2.
    walter hofmann published as part 2 of a paper on libraries 2on
    the psychology of the proletariat (zur psychologie das
    proletariats) 1in 1910. he carried out a great deal of research
    into the types of literature working class people read, what
    categories working class readers could be divided into and how
    to influence and improve their reading habits. he also carried
    out an important survey on women's reading. rudolf angermann
    continued and expanded hofmann's work. they both considered the
    stimuli to read certain types of literature to be of great
    importance and angermann formulated a list of different reading
    stimuli. they were both of the opinion that the librarian's
    task was to act as adviser and intermediary between the
    literature and the reader. their aim was to offer good quality
    literature to large sections of the people. today methods of
    reader research continue to be d eveloped in socialist
    countries and aim to achieve an optimal relationship between
    the acquisition and use of literature.
