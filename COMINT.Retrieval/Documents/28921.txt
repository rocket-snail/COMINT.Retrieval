when the library school wants to alter its road-map.
    reactions of librarians to recent proposals (taking account of
    the 1976-77 reports on possible elevation to university status)
    for a new curriculum in the norwegian state library school.
    points covered include the proposed 2-year common course, with
    specialisation in the 3rd year (generally approved); methods
    subjects (bibliography is considered necessary, but some
    consider computer studies nowadays equally essential);
    literature and society (thought to merit more attention,
    especially children's literature, popular literature, and
    services to handicapped and immigrants); information science
    (should be included in 2 or even 3 years); administration
    (considered absolutely essential); practical training (should
    probably be extended); evaluation of students' work (general
    opinion favours the retention of marking together with
    continuous evaluation); lecturing staff (library experience is
    preferred to academic specialisation); intake of stud ents (as
    far as possible should cover the whole country). better liaison
    on education between school and library profession is felt
    desirable, but there seems no major disagreement between the
    curriculum committee and librarians in the field.
