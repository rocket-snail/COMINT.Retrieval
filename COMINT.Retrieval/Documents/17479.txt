a simple analogue divider a circuit is described which
    provides an output voltage proportional to the ratio between
    two input voltages a pulse of duration inversely proportional
    to one input being used to gate the other input the results are
    accurate to within over a wide range of inputs an operational
    digital feedback divider in this divider the input pulses
    operate directly on the output the circuit forming a closed
    feedback loop in which the desired quotient corresponds to the
    only possible steady state the accuracy of the system can be
    selected by using the approprate number of significant digits
    from the eleven available new high frequency proximity effect
    formula
