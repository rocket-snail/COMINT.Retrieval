the maximum gain of an rc network analysis is presented
    indicating that any desired voltage gain can be achieved at a
    given real frequency by using networks of sufficient complexity
    as represented by the degree of the corresponding formulae
    transfer function theory developed previously of is used the
    relation between the maximum possible gain and the degree of
    the transfer function is determined the results are illustrated
    by examples
