literature for the blind and for people with sight
    problems: the publishing programme of the german central
    library for the blind. the german central library for the blind
    (deutsche zentralbucherei fur blinde) was opened in leipzig in
    1894, the 1st library of its kind in germany. current stocks of
    braille works total 7,700, comprising 26,700 volumes, since
    works in braille require more volumes than normal print books.
    books include fiction and non-fiction for children and adults
    and literature is also provided on tapes (67,000), cassettes
    (25,000) and records. sound recordings are particularly useful
    for the elderly, who find it hard to learn braille. most
    contacts with readers are made by post or telephone, but there
    is a public reading room with catalogues in normal print and
    braille. the library has staff and equipment for the production
    of braille books, talking books and the reproduction of tapes
    and cassettes. a list of recent acquisitions of large print
    books is included.
