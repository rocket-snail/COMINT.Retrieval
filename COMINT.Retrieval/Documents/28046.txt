measures of consistency in indexing' interconsistency.
    report of a brazilian study based on postgraduate course work
    in information science, designed to measure the consistency of
    performance by a group of indexers in selecting terms to
    represent document content. a preliminary discussion examines
    previous studies of consistency and formulas developed to test
    and measure both inter and intraconsistency. details are given
    of the methodology used here in a restricted study involving 10
    indexers and 1 article, and results presented in full, showing
    the number of terms assigned in relation to length of time
    spent; consistency between terms; and frequency of use of
    terms. the conclusions indicate the need for vocabulary
    restriction or prescription of terms to circumvent the problem
    of indexer subjectivity.
