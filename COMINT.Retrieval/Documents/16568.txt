circuit conditions for parametric amplification it is
    shown that signals may be amplified in a circuit which consists
    exclusively of passive elements if a nonlinear or time varying
    reactance is present the circuit conditions which must be
    satisfied are established and the differences between
    parametric amplifiers and mixers or modulators are
    discussed
