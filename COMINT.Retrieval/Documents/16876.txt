micro computer systems. the micro computer system is not
    unique, but just a simpler version of the mini and mainframe.
    it is only cheaper because less is provided, the facilities are
    inadequate for many operations, and if significant once-off
    programme development is required, most cost advantages of a
    micro system may be lost. discusses questions which should be
    raised when considering micro computer systems in the context
    of library automation and information retrieval. suggests that
    processor, memory and logic boards should cost no more than
    *62,000, and mass storage should be limited to floppy discs
    and/or cassette.
