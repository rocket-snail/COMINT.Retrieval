information by, and relations of the hospital pharmacist
    with the library information network. hospitals increasingly
    demand quick and specific pharmaceutical information. at the
    dispensary of the university medical school of szeged,
    information requests in 1979 were analysed. 20% referred to
    indication, 11% each to technology and accessibility. &l of
    the information required high qualification, the other &d
    related to economics. pharmacists need up-to-date information,
    but hungarian university pharmacies have no on-line system. in
    addition to the services offered by the national institute for
    medical information and the national institute of pharmacy,
    pharmacists rely solely on their own documentation systems. a
    card-file system including abstracts has been developed.
    pharmacists in szeged also use the libraries of the medical
    university and the faculty of pharmacology. at present,
    information supply meets requirements.
