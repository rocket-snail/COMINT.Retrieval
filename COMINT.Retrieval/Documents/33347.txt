electron resonance in gas discharges brief description f
    experiments in which absorption lines were observed by
    paramagnetic resonance technique using a cavity resonator
    constructed so that the gas discharge occupied the region of
    maximum microwave magnetic field strength the results indicate
    that this may constitute a sensitive method for studying the
    variation of concentration of free ions
