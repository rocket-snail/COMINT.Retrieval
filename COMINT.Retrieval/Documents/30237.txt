the libraries of the national statistical offices in the
    world. comments on the results of an enquiry. part 1. after
    outlining the historic development of the libraries of
    statistical offices and considering them one of the earliest
    types of specialised library, the result of a comprehensive
    statistical survey is presented which was conducted for the 1st
    time on a world-wide basis at the libraries of national
    statistical offices. the analysis of the results is followed by
    conclusions with regard to a further encouragement of the
    cooperation between libraries with a view to creating a
    world-wide documentation retrieval. in the light of these
    activities, as for instance in the field of atomic research,
    such a consideration can in no way be regarded as an illusion.
    this suggestion represents at the same time a partial programme
    for further work to be performed by the relevant ifla
    section.
