a surface wave parametric amplifier the proposed
    amplifier takes the form of a slab of ferroelectric material
    between two conducting planes the slab is pumped with high
    power useful gain would be achieved at x band frequencies even
    with present ferroelectric materials with new materials the
    amplifier could be used at mm
