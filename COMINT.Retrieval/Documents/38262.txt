photography: art form or legal forum?. the increasing
    critical acclaim given to photographs has resulted in their
    being exhibited in museums as a new art form, but this brings
    legal problems for the museum. subjects may claim invasion of
    privacy, and photographers may complain of a violation of
    copyright. careful sifting of legal principles involved with
    photographic matters and adherence to regulated procedures
    reduces the potential liability for vexations claims to
    manageable proportions. outlines what the registrar can do by
    reviewing the photographs and accompanying documents to
    minimise the museum's exposure to the hazards of invasion of
    privacy.
