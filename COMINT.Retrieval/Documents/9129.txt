diode amplifier outline of the properties and
    applications of amplifiers based on the reverse transient
    phenomenon associated with the high degree of carrier storage
    in an junction diodes thr frequency of the power supply must
    not be less than that of the modulating signal such amplifiers
    can be used as pulse repeaters in flip flop circuits or as wide
    band flat response amplifiers faster operation can be obtained
    with than with diodes
