a modification of warshall's algorithm for the transitive
    closure of binary relations an algorithm is given for computing
    the transitive closure of a binary relation that is represented
    by a boolean matrix. the algorithm is similar to warshall's
    although it executes faster for sparse matrices on most
    computers, particularly in a paging environment. april, 1975
