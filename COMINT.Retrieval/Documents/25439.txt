spin precession in a vibrating bloch wall at small
    amplitudes the natural frequency of vibration of the wall is
    derived on the basis of an effective internal magnetic field
    the formula obtained for a wall is identical except for a
    factor with that given by doring for a wall on the basis of the
    wall mass
