the resolution power of microfilms (in chinese). in order
    to have a deeper understanding of the influence of resolution
    power on microfilms, describes the determining methods of
    resolution power for film manufacturing and user's application.
    the expression of resolution power by lines per min is
    sometimes confusing, so the method readable by the pattern from
    the nbs resolution test chart 1010a regardless of the reduction
    ratio has been introduced. furthermore, using the quality index
    chart, it is possible to understand the difference between the
    resolution power required to microfilm the originals containing
    only romanic letters and those containing chinese characters,
    which are much more complicated in structure.
