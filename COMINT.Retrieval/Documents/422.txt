small signal heterodyne mixers with excessive injection
    amplitudes the theory of small signal heterodyne mixers
    operating with very large injection potentials is described the
    mixer properties investigated are the conversion
    transconductance the relative amplitudes of the difference freq
    ency and injection frequency components in the output and the
    amplitude of the injection modulation frequency component in
    the output in the case where the injection potential is
    amplitude modulated to a small degree a set of universal
    performance curves is obtained for mixers of a particular class
    chosen to illustrate the method
