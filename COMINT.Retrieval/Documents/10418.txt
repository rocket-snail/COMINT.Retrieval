effects of diffusion of electrons near the magnetic
    equator if it is assumed that ionization in the f layer is
    produced according to chapmans law then as the magnetic equator
    is approached the rate of increase in ionization wil exceed any
    decrease due to the effects of vertical diffusion described by
    schmerling of the hypothesis of vertical diffusion does not
    therefore account for the geomagnetic anomaly
