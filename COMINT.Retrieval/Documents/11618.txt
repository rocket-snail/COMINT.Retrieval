the coefficient of diffusion of ions in the f regions the
    application of sutherlands molecular model to the f region
    gives too large a coefficient of diffusion if recent rocket
    estimates of f layer molecular density are correct if langevins
    formula for the diffusion coefficient is used instead the
    discrepancy is less but for an f region in which diffusion is
    in inappreciable calculated values of the coefficient are still
    about times too large possible influencing factors are
    discussed
