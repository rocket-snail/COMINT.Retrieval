electromagnetic fields of axial symmetry bounded by a
    cone and a sphere the radiation field of a floating magnetic
    current ring in a space enclosed by spheres and cones is
    calculated this solution is extended to certain limiting
    conditions of direct bearing on em radiation from aerials in
    free space
