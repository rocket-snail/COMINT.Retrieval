method of measurement of the velocity of high energy
    electrons formulae relating the beam voltage to the oscillation
    frequency in carcinotrons and loaded waveguide linear
    accelerators are used to determine the electron velocity the
    only apparatus required is a wavemeter together with a small
    line velocities approaching that of light are treated
    relativity effects are taken into account
