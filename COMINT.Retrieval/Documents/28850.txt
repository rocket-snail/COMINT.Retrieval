oscillations in plasma part two discrete oscillations
    reported are studied in detail oscillations at the higher
    frequency are generated by the convergent beam in the central
    part of the tube while those at the lower frequency seem to be
    generated near the wall of the tube by the divergent beam
    another oscillation having an intermediate frequency is often
    observed
