not all in the mind: the virile profession. discusses the
    factors leading to the origin of the stereotype librarian (a
    'fussy old woman of either sex, myopic and repressed,
    brandishing or perhaps cowering behind a date-stamp and
    surrounded by an array of notices which forbid virtually every
    human activity'); its perpetuation in the media today; attempts
    by librarians to redeem their image (most attempts backfire,
    enhancing the image even more); the high incidence of women in
    and low status of the library profession, which are bound up
    with its image in a web of cause and effect; and the
    contradiction-librarianship, the bastion of the middle classes,
    has working class origins.
