optimum nonlinear filters theory of optimum nonlinear
    filter is based on the consideration of a sequence of classes
    of nonlinear filters n such that each class in the sequence
    includes all the preceding classes and also includes the class
    of linear filters the characteristic function of the optimum
    filter within the class n is found to satisfy a linear integral
    equation of od order a detailed treatment of optimum filters of
    class n is given and methods of approximate realization of such
    filters in the form of nonlinear delay line filters and power
    series filters are indicated the results are extended to the
    case of nonstationary time series
