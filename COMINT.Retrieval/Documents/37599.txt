the distribution of radio brightness across the crab
    nebula interferometer measurements were made at with aerial
    spacings on an axis and on a axis information regarding phase
    was obtained from independent measurements of the position of
    the source results show that brightness distribution is
    symmetrical and that optical and radio centres of the source
    coincide within of arc
