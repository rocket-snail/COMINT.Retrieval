a stable wide range dc amplifer description of an ac
    operated differential push pull amplifier for biological
    applications with a range from zero to and a maximum gain of
    about response can be controlled independently at the high and
    low ends o the range the dc gain can be reduced to of the mid
    band gain an automatic rebalancing circuit resets the zero of
    the amplifier at intervals of about sec
