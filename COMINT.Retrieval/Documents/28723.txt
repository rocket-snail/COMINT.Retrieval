nonradiative natural oscillations of a conducting sphere
    so surrounded by a layer of air and an ionospheric sheath a
    theoretical investigation having special reference to em
    oscillations of the earth and relevant to the study of
    atmospherics the dependence of the oscillation frequencies on
    the air layer thickness and on the plasma properties are
    analysed the lowest natural frequency to be expected for earth
    oscillations is about oscillations of low frequencies are
    reflected at the inner surface of the plasma while higher order
    oscillations may penetrate right through the plasma and radiate
    into space
