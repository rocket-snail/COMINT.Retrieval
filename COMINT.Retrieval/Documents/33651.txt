various ways of using cavity resonators in paramagnetic
    resonance note on operating conditions for greatest sensitivity
    in signal detection the cavity resonator not being matched to
    the guide cases considered are oscillator tuned to cavity
    resonance frequency ratio of reflected to incident power and
    oscillator frequency varying around resonance frequency
