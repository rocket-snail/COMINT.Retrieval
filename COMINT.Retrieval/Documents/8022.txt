analysis of multivelocity electron beams by the density
    function method mathematical techniques useful in the solution
    and interpretation of the density function equations as applied
    to multivelocity electron beam problems are presented with some
    conclusions about the nonconservative nature of signal or noise
    propagation along a multivelocity beam the paper serves as a
    background for a detailed calculation of noise propagation
    through the gun region of an electron beam
