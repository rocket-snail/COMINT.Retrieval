interferometric spectroscopy in the far infra red the
    response of a thermal detector to the resultant of two
    interfering infrared beams wal measured using a reflection
    interferometer with the path difference varied up to the
    spectral information is displayed in a fourier transform
    obtained by analysis of the resultant intensity path difference
