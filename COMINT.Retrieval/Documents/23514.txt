linguistic support in automated library systems. aims to
    show the current position and future development of linguistic
    support, with particular reference to the state automated
    system of scientific and technical information (gasnti). the
    content and structure of linguistic support is defined by the
    level of development of the library service and the information
    involved. in practice, linguistic support has to take account
    of not only the subject content but also a range of external
    features including bibliographical description. its application
    in different systems can be seen at an international level in
    unisist, as well as at national and local level.
