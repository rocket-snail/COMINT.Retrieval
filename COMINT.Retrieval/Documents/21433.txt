secondary electron emission by primary electrons in the
    energy range of to experiments were made using a primary beam
    from a small linear accelerator after passage through a
    magnetic analyser and targets of various metals the secondaries
    comprised two groups one with energy mainly and the other
    possibly elastically scattered with high energies curves show
    both the total secondary emission and the high energy component
    as functions of primary voltage for various target metals for a
    gold target the energy spectrum of the low velocity secondaries
    is investigated another graph shows the high energy components
    plotted against the atomic number of the target metal some
    experiments with insulator targets are briefly reported
