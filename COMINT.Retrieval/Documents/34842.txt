a solid state analogue to a travelling wave amplifier an
    attempt to improve the dispersive properties of multi diode
    parametric amplifiers was made by placing stacks of varactor
    diodes inside an l band helix bandwidths of and a noise figure
    of were obtained a low noise microwave quadripole
    amplifier
