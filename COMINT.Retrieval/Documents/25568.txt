controlled saturation in transistors and its application
    in trigger circuit design carrier storage of charge in
    transistors has a maximum which is defined as controlled
    saturation this depends only on the base current this idea is
    used to develop a trigger circuit of good resolving time whose
    output terminal is able to handle heavy currents and presents a
    low impedance
