geomagnetic influence on the f and f regions of the
    ionosphere effect of solar activity noon critical frequencies
    for the f and f layers are examined for different seasons and
    levels of solar activity it is found that the f layer exhibits
    a geomagnetic control at periods of high solar activity only
    whilst the equatorial trough in is most marked during periods
    of low solar activity
