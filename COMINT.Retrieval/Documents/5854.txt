political literature in libraries of the ruse region.
    from 1974-79, sections of political literature in 312 selected
    public, trade union and school libraries in the ruse region
    were the subject of a comprehensive investigation. 2,018
    readers completed questionnaires and 191 were interviewed. the
    proportion of political literature in the total book
    collections is on average 20%. the people who study political
    literature are predominantly students or pupils. regrettably,
    only 31.7% of the readers used libraries as a source of
    information for their necessary literature. mass media and
    educational establishments play a much greater part in this
    respect. the desirable turnover of political literature, the
    optimum number of copies, and the discarding of obsolete books
    are also covered. on the whole, the library service is
    performing a valuable role in political education, but even so,
    there is little room for complacency.
