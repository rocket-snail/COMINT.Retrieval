resonance absorber for electromagnetic waves an absorber
    for centimetre wavelengths consists of resonators regularly
    distributed over a metal plate the resonators are cavities
    containing a few milligrammes of fe powder and absorb energy by
    interaction with the magnetic component of the e m field the
    impedance of the absorber depends on the losses of the
    individual resonators and on their concentration a system
    theoretically giving total absorption at is obtained by making
    the impedance the characteristic impedance of free space
