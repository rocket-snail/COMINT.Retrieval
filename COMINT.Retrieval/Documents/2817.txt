a study of inter-library lending at the suhl district
    research library. in the last 3-4 years 5,000 book orders were
    processed annually by the suhl district research library. these
    include all the orders which were placed at other libraries in
    the district. between 40%-50% of ordered books can now be
    provided from the library stock at the research library. the
    book stock has grown from 25,000 in 1961 to 205,000 in 1979. in
    1966 a weekly courier service was introduced to improve
    inter-library lending. the suhl courier service operates
    between the central library of german classics, weimar, the
    university library, jena and back to the research library. on
    average 50% of books ordered could be supplied in under 10 days
    using the courier service.
