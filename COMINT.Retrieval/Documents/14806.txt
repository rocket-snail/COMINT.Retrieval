electronic collisional frequency in the region over
    calcutta determinations of the collision frequency were made on
    the basis of appletons formula relating ionosphere reflection
    coefficient with the difference between the group and optical
    wave paths whithin the region values corresponding to different
    heights in the layer are tabulated the most probable value is
