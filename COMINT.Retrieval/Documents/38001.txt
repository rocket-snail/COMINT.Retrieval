lf compensation for video amplifiers part amplifiers
    without feedback the departure from the ideal flat top response
    caused by low frequency distortion can be reduced by making the
    differential coefficients of the output function equal to zero
    at the order of compensation is designated by the number of
    derivatives equal to zero general theory is given and is
    applied to some typical resistance coupled amplifiers a single
    rc coupled stg stage can have second order compensation and
    multistage amplifiers can have higher orders of compensation
    experimental results confirm the analysis
