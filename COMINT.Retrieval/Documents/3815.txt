national-level cooperative reference services' a
    reaction. paper presented as a reaction to previous speeches at
    the reference and adult services division cooperative reference
    service committee programme at the american library association
    annual conference, san francisco, 29 june 81. puts the point of
    view of oregan state library regarding its involvement in the
    library of congress reference correspondence referral programme
    (2see1 82/5808) and briefly discusses the services provided by
    the slavic reference service at the university of illinois
    (2see1 82/5812) and the british library lending division.
    concludes that if a national-level referral system is not to be
    overloaded with inappropriate requests that unnecessarily
    increase the costs, there must be adequate local reference
    services available to all us residents and a public awareness
    of these local services.
