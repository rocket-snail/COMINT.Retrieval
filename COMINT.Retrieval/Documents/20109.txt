video in sweden (1). discusses the development of video
    in sweden and comments on a report by a working group of the
    swedish authors' union' 2video-for better and for worse1. the
    report warns against the negative sides of the development,
    such as dominance by commercial producers and passivity among
    viewers, but also points to advantages, such as freedom of
    choice and production for minorities. but for the positive
    sides to be developed, state support for production and
    distribution is necessary. thus the report suggests free loans
    through public libraries with state aid for extra staff
    employed, financed possibly through various taxes. some form of
    expansion of film censorship to cover video is necessary. a
    government report on video advertising suggests that it be
    banned, in the same way as tv advertising. for part 2, 2see1
    the following abstract.
