the characteristics of an electron beam entering a
    coaxial magnetic field the effect of nonuniformity field on the
    convergence of an electron beam is studied by considering a
    particular field configuration and calculating the path of an
    electron at the edge of the beam the radius of the beam is
    plotted as a function of distance travelled in the transition
    zone for different values of a parameter which is dependent on
    current density accelerating voltage and length of the
    transition zone
