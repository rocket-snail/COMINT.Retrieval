high speed magnetic amplifiers units based on ramseys
    half wave amplifier are discussed and the development of a new
    series of amplifiers is described the basic type is a reversing
    phase input reversing dc output amplifier circuit modifications
    are explained for obtaining reversing dc output fr reversing dc
    input and reversing phase ac or reversing polarity dc output
    other possible modifications are indicated
