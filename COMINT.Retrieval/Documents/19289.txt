oscillator with a or tbl transmitting valve details are
    given of the construction of a self excited oscillator using
    either a water cooled or an air cooled high power transmitting
    valve illustrations are given of the special anode grid and
    cathode grid circuit arrangements and of the method of coupling
    used for a water cooled dummy load consisting of a shorted
    coaxial line the power dissipated in the load about is
    estimated from the rise in temperature and rate of flow of the
    cooling water
