electron interaction in solids the nature of elementary
    excitations possible elementary excitations in solids are
    studied with the aid of the general theoretical approach
    developed in the preceding papers of this series and above
    particular attention is paid to the basic theoretical
    justification for the individual particle like elementary
    excitation effective electrons it is concluded that good
    qualitative arguments could now be given for the existence of
    effective electrons in solids the presence of an energy gap is
    shown to be a necessary condition for the existence of strong
    spatial correlations between minority carriers in solids and
    the nature of such correlated minority electron excitations is
    discussed
