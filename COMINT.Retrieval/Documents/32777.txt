some questions of library training, relation of
    university and high school training. contribution to a thematic
    issue on library training. library training should be based on
    the profession and not on the scope of activities. general
    professional training should be offered rather than specialist
    training. the subjects covered should be linked with each other
    and the profession's objectives. high school and university
    training should be separate, but connected in such a way that
    crossing from 1 to the other is made easier.
