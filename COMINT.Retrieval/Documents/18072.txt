on some aspects of matrix calculus applied to local
    oscillation in nonlinear circuits the application of matrix
    methods to the analysis of oscillating circuits with an
    impressed signal of lowamplitude is considered the
    representation of amplitude and phase modulation in co ordinate
    form is illustrated and examples are given of the use of these
    methods in problems of oscillator stabilization
