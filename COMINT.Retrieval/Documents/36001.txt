the international nuclear information system (inis).
    suggests that the international nuclear information system
    (inis) has been so successful because the basic assumptions
    decided upon in the original design have stood the test of
    time; the advantages of its decentralised input have been
    maximised through detailed guidelines, training, and good
    communications; there is a strong central management which,
    through national liaison officers, is very responsive to member
    states; and there is a strong spirit of goodwill and
    cooperation, generating much of the motivation.
