the operating mechanism of voltage dependent silicon
    carbide resistors measurements on aggregates of sic particles
    such as pressed powder show how thermal effects depend on grain
    size and the duration of the current pulse thermal and field
    effects can be separated by reference to resistance voltage
    characteristics at different temperatures for single contacts
    between crystals or between a crystal and a metal knife
