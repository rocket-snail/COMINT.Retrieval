thickness vibrations of piezoelectric crystal plates
    continuation of investigation noted in of the retroaction
    occurring in piezoelectric processes modifies not only the
    modulus of elasticity but also the direction of motion the
    influence of this secondary effect is studied and a complete
    theory of the mechanical electrical oscillating system is
    developed for plates of infinite area for plates of finite area
    the amplitude distribution becomes nonuniform the effect of
    this modification is studied in relation to the equivalent
    circuit
