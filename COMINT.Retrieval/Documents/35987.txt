theory of plasma waves in metals the hartree
    approximation is used to investigate the effect of the crystal
    lattice on plasma oscillations in metals a formula is derived
    for the oscillation frequency for free electrons this reduces
    to that given by bohm and gross for insulators there are no
    oscillations in metals with occupied d bands there is strong
    coupling between the plasma oscillations and the d electrons
    causing frequency broadening
