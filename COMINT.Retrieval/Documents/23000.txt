literature information and uap. the practice in the
    people's republic of bulgaria. since the mid 70s the term uap
    (universal availability of publications) has been current in
    library work. librarians have developed the process of making
    publications available universally along various lines. in
    bulgaria the concept has been taken up with much interest and
    discussed in detail. uap is to develop on 3 levels' national,
    regional and international. the national library in sofia has
    developed a catalogue system which presents a current
    bibliographical record of all national publications-this
    bulgarian national bibliography is published in 8 series. it
    enables the national library to supply literature on both
    national and international levels. the availability of foreign
    literature is improved by literature information sources such
    as, 2the central catalogue of foreign periodicals1 and 2the
    bulletin of foreign monographs1 both of which are now available
    in computerised form.
