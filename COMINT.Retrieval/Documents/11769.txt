some exactly integrable cases of electromagnetic
    oscillations in two coupled cavity resonators calculations of
    resonance frequencies are made for cavity configurations whose
    boundaries coincide with co ordinate surfaces of an elliptical
    cylindrical co ordinate system the expressions obtained are
    developed explicitly for the case of weak coupling and are
    compared with known approximations
