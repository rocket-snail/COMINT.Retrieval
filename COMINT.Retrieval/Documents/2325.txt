the administration of a smaller public library authority
    and the organisation of the county library system. in the
    netherlands local authorities with less than 30,000 inhabitants
    may organise their own library service. however, they are
    required by the dutch public libraries act to work in close
    cooperation with the county library network. library committees
    in these areas should include a representative cross-section of
    the social and cultural life of the community. committee
    members with local connections are more likely to understand
    the circumstances of the area. however, where the local library
    committee insists on following its own policies, the county
    library system may be prevented from pursuing a coordinated
    policy for all libraries throughout its region. the interests
    of the local community can be served by the creation of library
    users' committees in each area.
