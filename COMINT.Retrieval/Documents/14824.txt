occurrence frequency of geomagnetic micropulsations pc
    analysis of the diurnal occurrence frequency shows that a the
    frequency increases and time of maximum occurrence gets earlier
    as the turoral zones are approached b the diurnal distribution
    of frequency depends on universal time as well as local
    time
