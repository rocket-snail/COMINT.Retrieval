linear and nonlinear effects in reactance and oscillator
    circuits the analysis presented of the behaviour of a reactance
    valve in various circuits is based on an expression for the
    anode current containing terms up to the third degree in trid
    and anode voltages two nonlinear effects are considered the
    primary effect of the curvature in the valve characteristic and
    the secondary effect due to the presence of harmonic components
    in the applied signal these were also investigated
    experimentally and the results are presented graphically a
    circuit for reducing the effect of nonlinearity was also
    investigated
