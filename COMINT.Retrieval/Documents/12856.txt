electromagnetic shielding with transparent coated glass
    the shielding effectiveness of multilayer plane glass
    structures is investigated by determining their transmission
    factor for plane em waves three types of glass are considered
    at frequencies up to transmission line theory is used in the
    analysis the coatings being represented by shunting resistances
    theoretical and experimental results are compared attenuations
    of db and more can be obtained with tolerable loss of
    transparency
