the radio echo from the head of meteor trails
    calculations based on diffraction theory give values for the
    intensity of head echoes in agreement with observation and also
    indicate that the ratio between the intensity of the head echo
    and that of a specularly reflected body echo should be
    proportional to the radio wavelength and inversely proportional
    to the difference in range between these echoes other anomalous
    meteor echoes may arise from discontinuities associated with
    visual flares
