on the nature of equatorial spread f transequatorial
    propagation on via scattering from the f region above huancayo
    was closely associated with equatorial type but not temperate
    type spread f on huancayo ionograms ie range spreading not
    frequency spreading the irregularities take the form of thin
    sheets near the bottom of the f layer they are elongated in the
    direction of the earths field being or more in length and of
    the order of in at least one dimension transverse to the field
    it is suggested that equatorial spread f can occur only when
    the contours of mean electron density are parallel to the lines
    of force of the earths field
