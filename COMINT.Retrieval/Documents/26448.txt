a derivation of generalized microscopic electrodynamic
    equations non relativistic maxwells equations and the
    constitutive relations are derived from the classical
    microscopic theory without making use of extensive assumptions
    so that the effects of the higher order electric and magnetic
    moments are retained in the equations
