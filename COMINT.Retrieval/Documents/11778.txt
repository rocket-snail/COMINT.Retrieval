rotation of artificial earth satellites radio signals
    received from sputnik were subject to deep regular fading with
    a semiperiod of about probably due to free motion of the
    satellite about its centroid these fluctuations were less
    noticeable in the field strength record of sputnik the
    advantages of a disk shaped satellite and methods of
    eliminating rotational effects are discussed
