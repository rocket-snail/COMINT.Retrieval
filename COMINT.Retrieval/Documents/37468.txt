temporal variations of auroral radio echo activity in
    subauroral latitudes the diurnal day seasonal and year
    variations in the occurrence f of radio aurorae are
    investigated and also the time delay between class flares and
    the appearance l of aurorae is measured the bimodal diurnal
    distribution may be a consequence of the specular reflection
    properties of the auroral echoes
