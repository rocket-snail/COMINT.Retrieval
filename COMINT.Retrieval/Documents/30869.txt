the content and organisation of research (early results
    from the first 10 years). soviet libraries have seen a 25%
    increase in usage over the last 10 years. this expansion has
    been accompanied by a significant development of research into
    librarianship. resources have been concentrated on the study of
    some of the very real problems of library growth (the social
    function of libraries, ways of improving both ideological and
    information work, organising library systems on the bases of
    centralisation and cooperation), the number of people and
    places involved in research has increased and the system of
    directing research has changed with the strengthening of state
    control and the coordination of longterm planning.
