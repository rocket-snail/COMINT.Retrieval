the best books for the libraries. the search for reserves
    is vital. 300 replies to a questionnaire on acquisitioning in
    bibliotekar' (moscow) (1) 1981 were received: 200 from
    municipal libraries, 100 from rural ones. 54% of libraries
    mentioned library suppliers' unsatisfactory management of
    allocations; 90% mentioned poor fulfillment of orders. library
    suppliers' greatest deficiencies were in supplying fiction and
    children's literature, followed by history, technology, art,
    agriculture, medicine, natural history, popular science, sport,
    literature, ethics and law, education, domestic science.
    libraries in new towns have acute acquisitioning problems.
    school libraries should acquisition centrally through library
    suppliers. correspondents suggested more books ought to be sent
    to the library network. book-distribution must be strictly
    controlled, payment of booksellers' work being dependent on
    satisfactory fulfillment of libraries' acquisitions
    plans.
