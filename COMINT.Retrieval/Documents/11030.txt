the recording of information. in order to improve
    information services in the academic general central library in
    potsdam it was suggested that' time-consuming queries should be
    recorded on special forms, here described in detail; selected
    forms for elaborate queries should be incorporated into a
    keyword catalogue for future reference, the catalogue being
    divided into 2 files, 1 for time-consuming queries and 1 for
    brief literature references and miscellaneous information often
    required; topics most in demand should be ascertained and every
    topic put into a classified list which can then be used for
    stock expansion; and a telephone information service should be
    introduced.
