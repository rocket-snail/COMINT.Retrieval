computer networks systems' the impact of technology on
    co-operative interlending in the usa. revised version of a
    paper presented at the international seminar on national
    document provision, boston spa, 22-24 sept 80. recent us
    developments have favoured decentralised networks rather than
    centralised resource libraries. us libraries lack central
    planning and funding, and progress depends on individual
    library initiatives. in the last 10 years this has resulted in
    oclc, rlg, wln and 20 regional networks. describes the 3 major
    computer computer utilities. these computer networks would be
    complemented not duplicated by central resource libraries; with
    the national periodicals center effectively shelved, the center
    for research libraries could assume a more dynamic role.
    commercial vendors are often overlooked, but are an important
    element in document delivery systems. they are completely
    outside conventional library systems, and might cream off the
    profitable end of the document supply market .
