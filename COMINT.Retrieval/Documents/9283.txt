calculation of true heights of electron density in the
    ionosphere by assuming that the electron density distribution
    can be approximated by taking linear sections of variable
    length records may be manually converted to true height
    electron density profiles the method takes into account the
    earths magnetic field and is similar to that used by jackson
    results are compared with actual electron density profiles
    derived from rocket observations
