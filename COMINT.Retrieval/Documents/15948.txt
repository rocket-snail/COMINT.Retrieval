spin degeneracy and the theory of collective electron
    ferromagnetism a model is discussed for which the results
    obtained by neglecting or taking account of spin degeneracy are
    identical the model can be treated exactly and leads to
    equations for the free energy magnetization etc which are a
    generalization of those of stoners theory of collective
    electron ferromagnetism of
