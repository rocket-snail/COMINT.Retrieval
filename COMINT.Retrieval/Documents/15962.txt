cascaded feedthrough capacitors by interspersing lossy
    ferrite washers between the stacked ceramic disks of capacitors
    of the type described previously the filtering properties for
    and are greatly improved such constructions are thus useful for
    miniaturized low pass filters properties of suitable ferrites
    are discussed
