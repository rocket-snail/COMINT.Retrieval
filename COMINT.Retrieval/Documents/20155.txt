nonlinear capacitors for dielectric amplifiers the
    operation of the dielectric amplifier depends on the vas on the
    variation of dielectric constant with applied voltage
    requirements for materials suitable for high frequency small
    signal applications are discussed a two stage amplifier with rf
    power supply ad and gain of is briefly described
