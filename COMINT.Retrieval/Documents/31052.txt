which way for school media services to turn?. in the
    netherlands there has been much discussion in recent years on
    the transfer of school library services from the public library
    service to the responsibility of the local education
    authorities. in the present situation of cutbacks in public
    library finances there is considerable support for such a
    transfer. however, school librarians employed by the public
    library authorities, are as much a part of the school 'support'
    staff as educational psychologists and social workers also
    found in schools. librarians experienced in the provision of
    children's library services are in the best position to
    organise school libraries with their growing collections of
    audio-visual materials as well as their bookstock.
