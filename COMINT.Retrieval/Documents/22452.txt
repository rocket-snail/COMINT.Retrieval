the argus experiment a geophysical experiment on global
    scale was conducted last fall three small abombs were detonated
    beyond the atmosphere at a location in the south atlantic the
    purpose of the experiment was to study the trapping of the
    relativistic electrons produced by the decay fission fragments
    in the geomagnetic field the released electrons are trapped by
    this field oscillating along the magnetic lines between two
    mirror points in addition to this motion the electrons drift
    eastward creating a thin electron shell around the earth the
    lifetime and location of the thus created global electron shell
    were measured by satellite and rocket borne instruments auroral
    luminescence was observed at the conjugate points the electron
    shell exhibited remarkable stability during its lifetime no
    motion of the shell or change in its thickness was
    detected
