compensation of feedback control systems subject to
    saturation a theory for the design of compensating networks for
    feedback control systems and filters is developed the novel
    feature of this theory is its consideration of saturation and
    transient performance in addition to the usual steady state
    behaviour this theory is essentially an extension of the
    researches of wiener and lee in statistical methods for filter
    design saturation is handled by limiting the rms signal levels
    at critical points in the linear model used as the design basis
    for the physical system transient performance is handled by
    limiting the integral square errors to a set of transient test
    signals
