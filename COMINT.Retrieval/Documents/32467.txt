the measure of activity for oscillating quartz crystals
    in parallel resonance circuits the concept of performance index
    is explained this is the effective parallel resistance r of the
    resonant crystal shunted by a specified capacitance a method of
    measurement of r is described load current density should be
    specified when quoting r
