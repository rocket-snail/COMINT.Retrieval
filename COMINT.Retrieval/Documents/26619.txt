components for severe conditions of use a discussion of
    the factors to be considered in the design of capacitors and
    resistors for use under extreme temperature and humidity
    conditions particularly when the components are required to be
    as small as possible the use of ceramic covered wire for the
    windings of transformers etc to withstand high temperatures is
    mentioned
