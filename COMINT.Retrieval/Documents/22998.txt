investigation of sky brightness in the spectral region
    near during the solar eclipse of june the variation of the
    atmospheric infrared radiation excited by the incident solar
    ultraviolet radiation was investigated intensity variations
    observed at wavelengths of and indicate that the radiation from
    the corona is richer in ultraviolet than the radiation from the
