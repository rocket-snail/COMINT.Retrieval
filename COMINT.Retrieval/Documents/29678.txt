n.k. krupskaya and current problems in the organisation
    of library services to rural populations. raising the cultural
    level of life in the countryside is still a major task of
    soviet librarianship in the 1980s. recent developments have
    produced great quantitative improvements in rural library
    services, but qualitatively much still needs to be done. n.k.
    krupskaya was closely involved with this very problem in the
    1930s and her recommendations are still valid today. if what
    she wrote then can be put into practice now, the gap between
    the levels of service in town and country can be rapidly
    narrowed.
