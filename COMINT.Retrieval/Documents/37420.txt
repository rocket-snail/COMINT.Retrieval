diurnal variations in the number of shower meteors
    detected by the forward scattering of radio waves experiment
    the theory developed is applied to derive the expected diurnal
    variations of the meteor signal rate for four showers as
    observed by means of a particular forward scatter transmission
    path these results are then compared with the experimental
    signal rates the good agreement obtained indicates that the
    approximations inherent in the theory are sufficiently accurate
    for practical purposes the results also indicate that very few
    meteors if any are observed under conditions which do not
    satisfy the requirements for specular reflection
