a general steady state analysis of power frequency
    relations in time varying reactances this analysis produces the
    manley rowe results as special cases an energy coefficient is
    derived which specifies the behaviour of an individual
    frequency transformation the modes in which an individual
    transformation can operate are described and related to a wide
    range of varying reactance devices
