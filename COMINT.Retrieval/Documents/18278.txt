use or value of goals and objectives statements. man
    abstracts experience into symbols and uses them to redirect his
    energies in manipulating the real world. the organisational
    environments thus abstracted change so rapidly that man has
    difficulty in describing them. abstractions of organisations
    (such as libraries) should not be mistaken as having a reality.
    statements made on the purpose and goals of organisations are
    at best like hypotheses which are temporary descriptions of an
    environment that must be testable to be of value. the mark of a
    healthy organisation rests on the fervour with which it tests
    goals.
