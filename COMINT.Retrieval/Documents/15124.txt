dewey' the neglected introduction. dewey's introduction
    has been dropped from the current 19th edition of the
    classification scheme. perhaps because of its allegedly
    phonetic spelling it has been neglected. however, since it is
    considered that this introduction says everything which can be
    said about library classification it is considered that it
    should not now be forgotten. however the failure to relate the
    theory in the introduction to the actual arrangement of the
    subjects within the schedules set the unfortunate pattern by
    which library classification came to be discussed with little
    or no reference to the subject matter involved. the fact that
    dewey survives as the most widely used classification reflects
    the physical difficulty of trying to reclassify any established
    library and the lack of any new thinking in educational
    curricula. there is no evidence that later schemes represent
    any worthwhile advance on dewey.
