evaluation of the colombian institute of culture
    (colcultura)'s experimental programme of public-school
    libraries. report of a study carried out by the columbian
    interamerican school of librarianship, evaluating a 4-year
    trial in 4 cities begun in 1972, to establish whether or not to
    continue and expand the programme. details are given of the
    methodology, and a summary of results presented, covering such
    points as user attitudes and satisfaction; integration with
    school curricula; and adequacy of collections, personnel, and
    services. from these, it was concluded that relations between
    schools and libraries were deficient, resulting in inadequate
    library integration into educational programmes; training for
    the librarians involved is strongly recommended as a primary
    measure towards improving the project if it is to be used as a
    model for further development.
