near zone back scattering from large spheres theoretical
    treatment of back scatter from a perfectly conducting sphere
    for short wavelengths the back scatter cross section is
    modified considerably as the receiver approaches to within a
    few radii and becomes the cross section of a flat plate for a
    receiver very near the sphere
