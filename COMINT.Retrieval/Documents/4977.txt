a new application of the faraday magneto optical effect
    for diagnostic measurements of transient magnetic fields by a
    combination of streak and optical interference fringe
    techniques with the magneto optical method described it is
    possible to determine field geometry space time distribution of
    electron number density in a high density plasma and line
    integrated variations of magnetic field
