teleconference in virtual space. the author's invention
    of virtual space is the basis of a research programme to study
    the use in teleconferencing of the same modes of communication
    which work well in face-to-face communication. it can be used
    to create at each site of a teleconference the essential
    spatial relationships that would occur if all the participants
    were at each site. each participant is surrounded by a group of
    surrogate units, one unit per other participant and each unit
    comprising camera, microphone, visual display, and speaker. the
    relative positions of the participants are the same at each
    site.
