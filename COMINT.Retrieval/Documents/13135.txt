japanese newspapers and electronic media. the japanese
    attitude to newspapers and new electronic media is discussed.
    the japanese newspaper industry is considered to be in a
    healthy state. however there are closed links between
    newspapers, television and radio, in spite of legislation
    discouraging this, because newspaper managers see a threat and
    an opportunity in the new media. the new media particularly
    mentioned are teletext, videotex and video tapes and video
    discs.
