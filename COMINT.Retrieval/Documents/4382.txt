quantum theory of magnetostriction the theory of
    magnetostriction in hexagonal single crystals is developed on
    the basis of a polar model by considering the magnetic and
    magnetoelastic interaction of electrons in the lattice the
    energy spectrum of the crystal at low temperatures the free
    energy and the temperature dependence of magnetostriction
    constants are calculated
