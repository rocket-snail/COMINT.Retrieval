standardisation in the fields of librarianship and
    bibliography' the current situation and future prospects.
    standards have an important role in the implementation of new
    technology and the improving of economic efficiency. their
    relevance in librarianship includes improving reader services,
    maximising use of resources, accounting procedures and
    interlibrary cooperation. in 1976-78 existing standards
    relating to libraries were revised and coordinated and a
    long-term programme of standardisation covering information
    work, librarianship and publishing was initiated. aspects of
    librarianship affected by standards introduced since then
    include' the bibliographical description of music and maps,
    reference books in service points, basic terms and definitions
    in scientific information work, and a single national system of
    inter-library loans.
