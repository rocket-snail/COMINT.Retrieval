how human-usable is interchangeable? or, shall we produce
    catalogues or babelographic towers?. a number of international
    bibliographic standards, like the paris principles, the
    international standard bibliographic descriptions, and the iso
    standard for abbreviations, are evaluated in the light of
    universal bibliographic control. this article has been written
    with the communication problems (cultural, linguistics, etc.)
    of the heterogeneous ubc public in mind. emphasises the
    importance and possibilities of authority files as search keys
    to bibliographic descriptions and suggests that universal
    uniform headings be replaced by international standard control
    forms. with regard to bibliographic descriptions, the
    multipurpose use of (automatically) translatable descriptive
    information is proposed.
