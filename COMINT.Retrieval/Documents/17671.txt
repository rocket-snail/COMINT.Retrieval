the capacity and field of a split cylindrical condenser
    when the conductors differ in length the transformation using
    the usual notation of jacobian elliptic functions gives the
    complex potential at any point in the plane for the case of a
    plate of width raised to a potential symmetrically placed
    between two semi infinite plates at zero potential at distance
    apart from this the field and the capacitance of the system are
    obtained by the method of inversion by comparing the results
    with those of a previous paper two algebraic identities for the
    elliptic integrals and are obtained
