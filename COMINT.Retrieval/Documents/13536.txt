a procedure for the determination of the vertical
    distribution of the electron density in the ionosphere
    description of a method based on application of the gauss
    christoffel quadrature formula to the numerical integration of
    the well known integral for true reflection height s as a
    function of group height the earths magnetic field and the
    effects of electron collisions are neglected ray theory is
    assumed applicable and the electron density height curve is
    assumed to have no maxima or minima in the region
    considered
