the classical electromagnetic equations expressed as
    complex four dimensional quantities it is possible to compress
    the classical em equations into three complex four dimensional
    quantities representing respectively em field currents and
    charges and vector and scalar potentials this notation is
    useful in problems relating to waveguides cavities and aerials
    for microwaves
