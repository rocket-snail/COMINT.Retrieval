geomagnetic disturbances associated with solar flares
    with major premaximum bursts at radio frequencies mc a close
    association is found between solar flares in the early phase of
    which radio noise at frequencies is received and sudden
    commencement ionospheric storms on the earth it is suggested
    that this rf emission may be from the suns outer atmosphere and
    corona and thus may indicate which solar flares are accompanied
    by the ejection of storm producing particles although flare
    data are incomplete the proportion of flares having major early
    bursts is estimated at and the number of flares is comparable
    to the number of ionospheric storms not identifiable with well
    established day recurrent series an average time delay of days
    occurs between flare and geomagnetic disturbance and the
    intensity of the disturbance is related to the position of the
    flare on the suns disk
