ultra high frequency power amplifiers a general review of
    the design and construction of power amplifiers operating in
    the range travelling wave valves designed for a bandwidth of
    one octave are limited in their mean power output by
    overheating of the helix backward wave amplifiers based on
    crossed field interaction require a variable beam voltage for
    wide band operation but have a high efficiency and low
    operating voltage
