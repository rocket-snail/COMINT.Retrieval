variational formulation of two dimensional diffraction
    problems with application to diffraction by a slit diffraction
    particularly of waves is discussed analysis shows that for
    incident plane wave the complex amplitude of the far zone
    diffracted field can be expressed in a stationary form of the
    type indicated by levine schwinger the case of a diffracting
    slit of infinite length and finite width treated in detail for
    normal incidence the results agree with those
