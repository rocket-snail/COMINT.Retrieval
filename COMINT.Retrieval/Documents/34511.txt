analysis of millimicrosecond rf pulse transmission the
    analysis assumes a quadratic approximation for the complex
    propagation constant and a transmitted pulse with gaussian
    envelope the theory is applicable to uniform microwave
    transmission systems and relates pulse shapes with the cw
    properties of the system
