generation of very low frequency noise in the exosphere
    by the cerenkov effect the cerenkov effect produced by
    relatively slow moving particles of solar origin is considered
    as a possible mechanism for the generation and propagation of
    vlf noise the theory is briefly discussed in relation to a
    travelling wave tube model proposed by gallet of to explain
    similar vlf emissions
