electrical control of valve transmitter frequency by
    means of an electrodeless gas discharge the tuned circuit
    inductor of an oscillator was wound round an argon filled
    cylindrical container in which an electrodeless discharge could
    be mained the oscillator frequency was nearly linearly
    proportional to the anode voltage and was also dependent on the
    gas pressure see also
