planning school libraries. a school library is a library
    first and foremost and must allow the smooth procedure of
    bibliographic work in an attractive setting suited to users'
    needs. a major problem in older school buildings is the
    location of a centrally situated room of suitable size. careful
    preliminary planning by administrators, teachers, library
    authorities, school librarians and the architect is essential;
    they must establish the library's role in the school, teachers'
    requirements and whether the general public will use the
    library. questions to be considered include building materials,
    furniture, lighting, flooring and colour schemes. then the
    architect can prepare plans for which, after further
    discussion, estimates can be made.
