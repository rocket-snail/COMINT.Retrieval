bibliographic instructions in business libraries. recent
    articles have discussed the business student's lack of skill in
    using the library and the need for librarians and teaching
    faculty to become involved in preparing these future business
    leaders to do library-centred research. a survey of 120
    academic libraries was conducted to identify useful and
    effective bibliographic instruction methods. nearly 50% of the
    respondents felt that teaching library use in connection with a
    regular course in the curriculum was the most effective method
    of library instruction. of those responding, 88% of the
    libraries are using this method.
