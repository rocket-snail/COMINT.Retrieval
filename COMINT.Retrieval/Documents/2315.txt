the use of the blaise editor at garnett college library.
    garnett college is the british library's only customer to
    dedicate its entire cataloguing operation to on-line working
    and is consequently dependent on the facilities offered by the
    blaise editor. outlines the cataloguing procedure at the
    college, mentioning weaknesses in editor's conception, those
    facilities that are of little practical value, its advantages,
    and cost. concludes that on-line input via editor is an
    efficient and economic means of production for a computer-based
    catalogue.
