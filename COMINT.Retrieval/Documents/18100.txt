a new classical theory of electrons part the theory
    previously proposed and of is applied to a system comprising
    several interpenetrating streams of electricity moving in
    accordance with the equations of maxwell and lorentz an action
    principle is set up and the equations of motion are put in the
    hamiltonian form the hamiltonian has some similarity to that
    for point charge electrons but there is some discrepancy
