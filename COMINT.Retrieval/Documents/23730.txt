some thoughts on national retrospective bibliographies.
    an edited version of a paper presented at the 1981 ifla
    conference in leipzig discussing the problems of retrospective
    bibliographies and the author's own approach, in relation to
    the ifla retrospective bibliography programmes. examines what
    constitutes a retrospective bibliography, and then considers
    the particular problems relating to those not linked to current
    national bibliographies, both in countries with a long
    publishing tradition and in third world countries; the
    production of retrospective bibliographies simultaneously with
    current bibliographies is then discussed; describes techniques
    and resources for constructing both kinds of bibliographies,
    and problems of organisation.
