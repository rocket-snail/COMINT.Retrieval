the effect of the magnetic equator on the ionization of
    the e layer observations made at stations at different
    latitudes in africa and europe are analysed daytime values of e
    show a pronounced maximum at the magnetic equator observations
    of the e blanketing frequency indicate that the e minimum
    ionization ceiling is not subject to the effect which exists
    only for the ionization clouds
