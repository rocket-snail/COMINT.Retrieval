the effect of the earths oblateness on the orbit of a
    near satellite the equations of motion of a satellite in an
    orbit over an oblate earth in vacuo are solved analytically by
    a perturbation method the solution applies primarily to orbits
    of eccentricity or less the accuracy of the solution for radial
    distance should then be about and the error in angular travel
    about per revolution a brief comparison is made between theory
    and observation for sputniks and
