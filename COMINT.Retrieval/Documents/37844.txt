library networking in australia' the past is future.
    takes a critical look at proposals by the national library of
    australia to produce a national bibliography network (abn). the
    licence for a software package, developed and implemented at
    the washington state library, known as the washington library
    network, was acquired in 1980 after considerable testing. puts
    the proposals in the broader context in which they are set.
    they system has 4 main components' on-line union catalogue;
    on-line bibliographic source file; catalogue processing; and
    catalogue production. concludes that the system will not
    succeed for economic reasons-it bundles with its offerings a
    processing capability which is already available elsewhere at a
    lower cost.
