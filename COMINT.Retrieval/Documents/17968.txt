silicon solar batteries as a source of electrical supply
    in artificial earth satellites experiments using si pn
    junctions to convert solar radiation into electrical energy are
    described photo elements having a surface area of cm and a
    thickness of mm were used at sea level with the suns rays
    incident normally an efficiency of was recorded corresponding
    to for an area of m with a solar constant of a si plate exposed
    to the sun showed a temperature of
