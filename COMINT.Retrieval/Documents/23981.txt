an analysis of electric field after lightning discharges
    the thundercloud is represented by a vertical dipole and the in
    it is represented by a constant current generator the electric
    field comprises components due to the charge on each pole which
    depends on the conductivity of the air space charge related to
    the charge on the poles and free decaying space charge released
    after a lightning discharge dissimilarity between the field
    recovery curves for near discharges and distant discharges are
    explained by thid theory stant discharges are explained by this
    theory
