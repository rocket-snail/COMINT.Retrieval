millimeter waves from harmonic generators fundamental and
    harmonic powers obtainable at wave lengths down to using a si
    crystal frequency multiplier with different types of reflex
    klystron have been measured three types of multiplier are
    compared these are a commercial si crystal mounted upright on
    the exterior face of the harmonic waveguide a crystal with
    windows cut in the face so tht the tungsten whisker is exposed
    a whisker and si block mounted in the waveguide arrangement is
    the most satisfactory for wavelengths below mm the performance
    of arrangement as a detector is discussed a crystal harmonic
    generator used with a n narrow band amplifier will furnish
    enough power at mm wavelength to give a dynamic range of
