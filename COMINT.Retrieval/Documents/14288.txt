intrinsic stability conditions for equivalence between a
    quadripole including active elements and a passive quadripole
    there are two necessary conditions image impedances must be
    passive image attenuation must exceed the value of a certain
    function of the phase angle of the image impedance and the
    image phase shift coefficient in certain important cases this
    second condition reduces to a simple mathematical form
