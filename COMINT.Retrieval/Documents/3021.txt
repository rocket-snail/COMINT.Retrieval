global characteristics of the separation between the f
    and f layers of the ionosphere records of the separation
    between the f and f layers have been analysed in respect of
    seasonal and sunspot cycle variations the seasonal variations
    are similar to those observed by appleton for the height of the
    f layer of at at high latitude stations the variation of
    separation followed the trend of sunspot activity in summer but
    not in winter at stations close to the geomagnetic equator the
    separation varies inversely as sunspot activity in all seasons
    the observed variation with season and latitude are consistent
    with the view that the f and f layers belong to a common bank
    of ionization no simple explanation of the variations with
    sunspot cycle is at present possible
