piezoelectrically activated low frequency mechanical
    resonators discussion of resonators comprising plates or bars
    carrying two relatively small piezoelectric crystals the
    parameters of the equivalent electrical quadripole are
    determined for flexural modes of some circular chladnis plate
    type resonators application to stabilization of sinusoidal
    oscillators is briefly described
