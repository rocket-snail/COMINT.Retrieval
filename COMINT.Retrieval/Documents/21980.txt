an integrable case of electron motion in electric and
    magnetic field the case is considered of a two dimensional
    electric field with the potential given by applied together
    with a uniform magnetic field in the direction the path of an
    electron is an ellipse whose centre moves in a hyperbola the
    electron may drift into regions of higher or lower
    potential
