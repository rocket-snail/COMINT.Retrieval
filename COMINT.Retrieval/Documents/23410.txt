the importance of teaching use of the library.
    introduction to an occasional series on use instructions in
    academic libraries. bibliographic instruction is teaching
    students how to find information efficiently and effectively in
    the modern library. instituting bibliographic instruction
    programmes permits students to do better work, to be more
    independent in their work and to have more motivation. this
    allows assignments to be more varied and expectations can be
    higher. bibliographic instruction also helps to insure that the
    collection is well used-an important argument when cost
    effectiveness is a prime consideration in all administrative
    decisions.
