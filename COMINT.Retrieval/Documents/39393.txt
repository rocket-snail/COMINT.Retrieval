    program. paper presented at the reference and adult services
    division cooperative reference service committee programme at
    the american library association annual conference, san
    francisco, 29 june 81. describes the setting up of a
    cooperative referral system to answer written reference
    enquiries sent to the library of congress. as an experiment,
    enquiries of a general nature, not specifically needing an
    answer from the library of congress, were passed onto oregon
    state library to improve efficiency and speed up replies. later
    other state libraries joined the scheme. suggests future
    development at international level, referral from the bottom up
    as well as the top down, and the use of electronic mail.
