determination of the proportion of reflected electrons in
    the secondary electron emission from copper and gold an
    experimental determination is reported the retarding field
    method of was used with primary potentials of the secondary
    electron yield was corrected for the space charge effect at a
    primary potential of and a retard ng potential of the
    percentages of reflected electrons in the total secondary
    electron yield are and respectively the percentages are
    respectively the results are presented graphically and are
    tabulated
