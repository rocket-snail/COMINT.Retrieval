if confidence vanishes in the future' state library
    centre, whither goest thou?. most state library centres, except
    those in bavaria, now have to face financial restrictions, just
    at a time when increases in stocks and services are badly
    needed. everything that library centres hoped for seems
    threatened. the german tendency towards perfection applies to
    medium-sized rather than to small organisations. the increased
    use of non-book media has changed the centres' role. the
    centres have played an invaluable part in developing rural
    library services but their golden age is now past. library
    policy could be altered, however, through the performance of
    the centres' tasks by regional library associations. these
    associations should be formed in areas where none exist; based
    on a constitution worked out by local politicians, they can
    work towards improving service quality.
