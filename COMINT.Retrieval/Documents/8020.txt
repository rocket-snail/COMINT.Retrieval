synthesis of lc networks a method is outlined for the
    synthesis of certain voltage transfer functions by means of
    asymmetrical balanced lc networks terminated at the load end by
    a resistance a simplified analysis of transients in linear
    circuits caused by the frequency modulation of an input signal
    a simplified method of investigation of transients is described
    with the introduction of the concept of the transmission
    frequency coefficient an explanation is provided for the
    mechanism of dependence of the time constant of the frequency
    transient on the frequency of modulation of the input signal
    the frequency coefficients of transmission for aperiodic and
    differentiating circuits are also considered
