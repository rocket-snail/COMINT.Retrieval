some properties of lightning impulses which produce
    whistlers results obtained at stanford california and boulder
    colorado show that a characteristic waveform having an intense
    energy peak near is frequently associated with the impulse
    which produces a whistler whistler producing discharges appear
    to be more frequent over sea than over land identification of
    the causative impulse should be based on waveform analysis as
    well as the time of occurrence
