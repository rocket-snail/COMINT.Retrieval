proposal for a common exchange/communication format'
    opinion paper on standardization of machine readable
    bibliographic records. the international organisation for
    standardization developed its standard iso' 2709-1973 which
    formed the basis for the development of several machine
    readable bibliographic record formats. outlines a format giving
    much importance to the data elements and their constituents,
    with unique identification for each of the constituents
    following a tagging scheme. a model format for the
    bibliographic description of simple monographs is presented as
    illustration which reflects a singly linked list structure,
    each preceding tag of a data element having a field giving the
    length of the associated data element, which serves as a
    pointer to the beginning of the succeeding tag and its
    associated data element.
