effect of specimen shape on ferromagnetic resonance in a
    strong radio frequency field an analysis of the exact solutions
    of the landau lifshits equations an expression is derived for
    the threshold field above which instability in the motion of
    the magnetization vector begins for resonance field strengths
    the height of the absorption peak decreases and its width
    increases
