design of video couplings a method is presented for
    designing low rise time video amplifier coupling networks with
    three of four independent elements by the proper location of
    complex zeros and poles of the network function the relations
    between rise time overshoot and delay are determined graphs are
    presented for determining the type of response of a circuit
    with given type of response
