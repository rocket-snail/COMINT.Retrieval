bibliography-that is very interesting! but why has it no
    place in the school curriculum?. the yaroslavl regional
    children's library is successfully organising
    library/bibliography classes for 1st to 8th formers, including
    a quarterly bibliography day, aiming to interest school
    children in books. bibliography day includes songs about famous
    literary heroes, questions to answer from encyclopaedias, etc.
    playing while learning proved possible, even necessary. but the
    region has only partially adopted the syllabus' 'foundations of
    library/bibliographic knowledge'. in 1979 the government paper
    on improving the rsfr (russian soviet federal republic)
    children's library service stressed the need for studies
    according to a given syllabus. but 275 out of 365 schools in
    chuvashiya and 90% of moscow schools avoid this work.
    bibliographic literacy is of national importance.
    responsibility rests with libraries and educational
    establishments.
