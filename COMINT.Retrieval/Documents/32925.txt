use statistics: a planetary view. historical statistics
    from the automated circulation system were profiled against
    total book holdings at the nasa goddard space flight center
    library to reveal interest patterns and recent changes in use.
    these statistical ratios were analysed as a critical increment
    of an overall library evaluation study to determine the degree
    to which the library met and anticipated needs. the analysis
    resulted in the strengthening of certain areas; it initiated an
    automated change detection mechanism, and it accelerated the
    decision to store use history in the machine readable shelflist
    record as a management information system data element.
