readability and semantic redundancy threshold. using a
    semantic definition of redundancy (adapted from communication
    theory), relates the readability threshold to a redundancy
    threshold and defines readability through redundant semantic
    features, the extent of their intersection, and the critical
    interval between recurrences. readability thus consists of a
    balance between a supersaturation of interconnected items and a
    subsaturation of compatible items which can be interpreted as a
    proportion.
