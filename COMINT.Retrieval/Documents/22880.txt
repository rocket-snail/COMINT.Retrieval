recent developments in professional training. owing to
    government economy measures the documentalists' training school
    must close by 1893 and the planned course on information and
    documentation in darmstadt may not after all begin in 1982,
    which poses a real threat to all basic and advanced training
    courses. there is still dispute over the value of integrated
    training courses for librarians and documentalists and as to
    whether documentalists should have degree status. information
    scientists are the vital link between the public and
    information produced by an ever widening range of technological
    products. a unified training system with good promotion
    prospects must be established with degree qualifications for
    the highest staff grades. the transition period resulting after
    the establishment of a new system will demand further training
    after a basic qualification has been obtained.
