calculation of the oscillation frequency of a quartz
    crystal maintained by a transistor the calculation presented
    previously of july is extended to the general case where it is
    required to determine both the influence of the maintaining
    system on the frequency and the possibility of aligning this
    frequency with a given reference frequency formulae are derived
    based on the use of capacitors in series and in parallel with
    the crystal
