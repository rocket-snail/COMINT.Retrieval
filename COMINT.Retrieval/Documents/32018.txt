the information requirements of sport, physical education
    and recreation staff and how librarians can be of assistance.
    the particular information requirements of physical education
    staff in colleges and universities are often ignored or not
    fully understood by librarians. the subject concerns of such
    people embrace elements from all the major disciplines. a
    survey of staff involved in carrying out research in sport,
    physical education and recreation in uk universities and in
    certain polytechnics and research organisations revealed that'
    just under 50% had not used an abstracting/indexing journal in
    the course of their work; well under 20% had used a
    computer-based search system; 60% had not received any kind of
    bibliographical instruction, but most of this group believed
    instruction would have helped them; 80% would have been willing
    to allow librarians to carry out literature searches; 20% could
    not 'read' in a foreign language and only a minority of those
    who could, actually scann ed material in the language.
