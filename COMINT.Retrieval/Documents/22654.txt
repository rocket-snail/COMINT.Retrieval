wire cylinder electric discharges in air in relation to
    the space charge field emission hypothesis study of
    experimental data on wire cylinder discharges in relation to
    the field emission hypothesis yields graphical and arithmetic
    methods of finding the effective field at the time of flash
    initiation and the space charge field at the wire the effective
    field is of the order of and is interpreted as a measure of the
    emission field of the cathode metal or of the ionized air see
