computer generation of gamma random variables - ii a
    rejection method is proposed for generating gamma variates with
    nonintegral shape parameter a, a > 1. this method is similar
    to other methods given by fishman, wallace, and tadikamalla and
    is faster than these methods for a> 2. the core storage
    requirements and the programming effort for the proposed method
    are similar to those of wallace's or tadikamalla's methods. the
    computational times for the proposed method remain fairly
    constant for medium and large values of a and are superior to
    times obtained by ahrens and dieter's method for all values of
    a. the proposed method is simpler than ahrens and dieter's
    method. november, 1978 tadikamalla, p.r. gamma variables,
