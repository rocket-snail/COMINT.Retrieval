in search of carnegie. discusses a project undertaken in
    1979 with the support of the ontario heritage foundation and
    the british council to find out about the history of carnegie
    public libraries in canada. attempts to answer questions such
    as the number of carnegie libraries, how communities managed to
    get grants to build libraries and who designed the buildings.
    visits have been made to many library buildings in canada and
    the uk and although some information has been obtained the
    project is expected to continue until at least 1982.
