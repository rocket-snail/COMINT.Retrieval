ionospheric variations associated with geo magnetic
    disturbances part variations at moderate latitudes and the
    equatorial zone and the current system for the sp field
    variations of the e and f regions are studied the current
    system for the s field is calculated the ionospheric variations
    may be due to the effect of a vertical drift by the earths
    magnetic field and the electric field of the s current
