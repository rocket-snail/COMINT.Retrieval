amplifier stage with monotonically rising response to a
    step signal the problem is to combine the monotonic response
    shortest possible rise time starting from consideration of a
    simple coupling and analysis based on laplace transforms the
    coupling circuit giving the required response is found in the
    form of a network with parallel vertical and series horizontal
    arms
