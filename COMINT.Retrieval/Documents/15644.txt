the acousto electric effect theoretical calculations
    indicate that an electric current should be generated in a
    crystal by the passage through it of an acoustic wave in a
    metal the electrons concerned are at the fermi level in an n
    type semi conductor they are in the conduction band
    calculations for na and for n type ge indicate that the
    predicted effect should be measurable
