a carrier energized bistable circuit using variable
    capacitance diodes a variable capacitance junction diode when
    used in a simple circuit driven from a high frequency source
    can cause that circuit to have a bistable characteristic
    suitable for dynamic storage or to have a sensitive output
    input characteristic suitable for control or detection
    purposes
