temperature distribution of the ionosphere under control
    of thermal conductivity bates theory is extended the energy
    absorbed in the region is assumed to be conducted downward into
    a denser region where it is dissipated by infrared emission
    calculations indicate that the atmosphere is isothermal above
    about and that there is a very strong temperature gradient
    between and the temperature in the isothermal region must be
    assumed to be to meet the requirement for the atmosphere near
    to support an region the low temperature at is due primarily to
    the lack of absorbed energy there rather than to the presence
    of a strongly emitting layer
