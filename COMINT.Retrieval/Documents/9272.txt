interaction of moving charges with wave circuits when a
    charge moves along a nondispersive transmission line it induces
    forward and backward wave components in the line for
    unaccelerated motion there is no radiation unless the charges
    moves with the speed of an unforced wave for small
    accelerations both radiation to the line and electro magnetic
    inertial effects caused by changes in the energy of the fields
    will be observed the electro magnetic mass at velocities
    greater than the wave velocity is negative large accelerations
    can be handled by numerical computation in the case of
    dispersive circuits the charge radiates at frequencies for
    which the phase velocity of the circuit is equal to the
    velocity of the charge this radiation is identified with
    cherenkov radiation similar radiation takes place when a charge
    moves through a plasma
