compensation of direct coupled amplifiers against drift
    caused by heater voltage fluctuations the output from a
    thermopile heated from the source which supplies the valve
    heaters of an amplifier is fed back either to the input or to
    the indicator to compensate for zero drifts the drift is
    reduced by two thirds without loss of amplifier
    sensitivity
