small signal power conservation theorem for irrotational
    electron beams the theorem describes the balance between the rf
    kinetic and rf electromagnetic powers in a laminar beam the
    thermal velocity distribution at the cathode is neglected the
    kinetic power flow is expressed in terms of the chu potential
    the longitudinal component of the rf beam current and the
    equivalent longitudinal surface current on the beam boundary
