the luminescence of phosphors in strong electric fields
    the account of the phenomenon of electroluminescence given by
    destriau see eg of is critically discussed cells used for
    demonstrating the phenomenon always take the form of a
    stratified capacitor including a layer of gas and a layer of
    solid dielectric of much greater breakdown strength the gas
    being occluded either in the electrodes or in or between the
    phosphor grains with such an arrangement a glow discharge
    occurs in the gas layer for voltages above a certain threshold
    and below sparking voltage it is concluded that this is the
    true explanation of the observed phenomenon
