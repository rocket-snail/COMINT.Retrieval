the electron density distribution in the outer ionosphere
    derived from whistler data a method of successive
    approximations is developed to determine the electron density
    distribution with height in the outer ionosphere when the
    variation of whistler dispersion with geomagnetic latitude is
    known the method is applied to specific whistler data and the
    results infer that the electron density distribution decreases
    exponentially with height in the range km an equation is
    derived for the distribution in this height range during
