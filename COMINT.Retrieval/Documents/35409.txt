ionospheric storms in the auroral zone the values of f
    observed at college alaska are statistically analysed when the
    f layer in the auroral zone is sunlit the value of f usually
    begins to decrease just after the commencement of a geomagnetic
    storm this is attributed to an expansion of the layer due to
    heating caused by impinging corpuscles when the f layer is in
    darkness an increase of f is observed
