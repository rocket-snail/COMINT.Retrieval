nonlinear servomechanism the various factors limiting the
    application of the linear theory of servomechanisms are
    discussed the theory of filtered systems using relays developed
    independently by dutilh of and kochenburger is outlined and two
    net criteria applicable to all filtered servomechanisms are
    established the first criterion is concerned with the
    possibility of hunting taking place and includes the criteria
    of nyquist and kochenburger as special cases the second
    criterion determines the stability of such oscillations of the
    system
