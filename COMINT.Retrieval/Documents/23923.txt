stabilization problems in physics a review of voltage
    current and magnetic field regulators the performances of
    various stabilizing valve circuits and primary regulators are
    compared and the importance of good control of filament heating
    voltages is emphasized special problems of stabilization in
    nuclear physics are mentioned
