diffraction by an imperfectly conducting half plane at
    oblique incidence the exact solution has been obtained for the
    problem of a plane wave incident at an oblique angle on a
    metallic half plane the analysis requires the solution of
    coupled wiener hopf integral equations for the electric and
    magnetic current distributions excited on the surface of the
    half plane
