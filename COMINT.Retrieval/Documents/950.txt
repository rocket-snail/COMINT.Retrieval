the cryosistor a field effect controlled impact
    ionization switch a new three terminal device is described in
    which the impact ionization of impurities in ge at is
    controlled by means of the depletion field effect of a reverse
    biased junction the localized nature of the ionization should
    permit the construction of numerous independent cryosistors on
    a single ge wafer
