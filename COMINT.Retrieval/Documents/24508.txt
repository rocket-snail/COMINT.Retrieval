    discusses the meaning of collection development in the 1980s
    and the fiscal adversities facing east asian collections in the

    east asian books and postage rates, nd increased danger of cuts
    in under-utilised collections such as those specialising in
    east asia). suggests strategies (specialisation, cooperation,
    sharing checklists of unique holdings, reduction of
    duplication, and optimal use of new technology) and describes
    the preparations for future development made by the east asian
    collection of the hoover institution, stanford university,
    california.
