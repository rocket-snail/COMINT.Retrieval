the belt of equatorial spread f igy data are used to
    discuss the morphology of nocturnal spread f incidence in the
    equatorial belt and this is compared with the morphology of the
    post sunset increase of f layer virtual height between magnetic
    latitudes the incidence of spread f is high but decreases
    during periods of magnetic disturbance existing theories are
    inadequate to explain the observations
