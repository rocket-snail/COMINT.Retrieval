the remnants of supernovae as radio sources in the galaxy
    a critical survey is presented of recent work on the sources of
    galactic radio emission at metre wavelengths observations
    indica e that remnants of supernovae may account for some of
    the sources and radio emission may be due to collisions of gas
    at high velocities results of flux density calculations at are
    tabulated
