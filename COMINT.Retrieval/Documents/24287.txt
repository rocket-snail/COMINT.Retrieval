criteria determing the design and performance of a source
    modulated microwave cavity spectrometer an analysis is given of
    the radio and audio frequency modulation method employed in
    microwave spectroscopy the results of the theory are compared
    with measurements taken on a microwave spectrometer and are
    found to be in close agreement the calculations are extended to
    include the case where an absorbing gas is enclosed in a
    resonant cavity
