registration-identification of crystalline materials
    based on lattice and empirical formula. data files containing
    information on solid-state materials are expanding rapidly.
    each year several thousand new materials are characterised by
    x-ray diffraction techniques. consequently, computer procedures
    have been developed to register materials entering large data
    files. registration based on lattice parameters and empirical
    formula is especially effective. the lattice is uniquely
    represented by the reduced cell and the elements in the formula
    are uniquely specified by prime numbers. this method has been
    applied for several years to register new materials for the
    cambridge crystallographic data file which contains data on
    more than 25,000 compounds containing organic carbon. the
    method is now being adapted to register materials for the nbs
    crystal data file.
