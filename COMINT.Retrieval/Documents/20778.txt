the automatic generation of literature abstracts: an
    approach based on the identification of self-indicating
    phrases. presents a method for the automatic generation of
    indicative abstracts based on the identification of
    commonly-occurring structures which explicitly state that the
    sentences containing them have something important to say about
    the subject matter or 'message' of the document. examples of
    such structures or 'indicators' are 'the principal aim of this
    paper...' and 'a method is described for...'. discusses the
    identification and weighting of indicators; addition of
    supportive sentences; and treatment of exophoric features. the
    results of a test run aiming at 105-word abstracts were
    promising.
