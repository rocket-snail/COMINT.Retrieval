theory of the contact between a metal and a semiconductor
    for a large contact potential difference the iv characteristic
    for the contact between a metal and a semiconductor is
    calculated for the case when the contact potential difference
    is so great that the type of conduction of the semiconductor
    near the contact is altered from the electron to the hole type
    the calculations cover the cases of plane knife edge and needle
    types of contact
