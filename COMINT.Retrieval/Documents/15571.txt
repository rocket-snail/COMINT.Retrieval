learning system for automatic structural analysis of mass
    spectra. a computer-assisted mass spectral interpretation
    system with a learning mechanism is described. the set of
    correspondences between substructure and spectral component
    (cssc) is used for interpreting mass spectra. cssc is
    generated, renewed, and improved automatically in the system.
    chemical structures are represented in terms of blocks, which
    facilitates the learning process.
