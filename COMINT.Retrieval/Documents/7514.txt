transistor oscillators and their load independent
    properties the equivalence of the internal and the external
    feedback in a transistor oscillator circuit is established two
    types of load independent oscillator are considered one with a
    load impedance in parallel with the equivalent passive
    quadripole and the other with the impedance in series the
    conditions for obtaining an oscillator with two load
    independent impedances and a load independent oscillator in the
    form of a six terminal network are examined see also of
