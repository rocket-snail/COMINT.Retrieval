france from the librarian's view. compared with the usa,
    uk and the scandinavian states france has awakened from its
    dream late to try to develop an up-to-date librarianship. in
    recent years development has been significant. this is
    evidenced by the 5-story centre georges pompidou inaugurated in
    1976. it is a complex of museum, library, bookshop, record
    shop, cinemas, theatre, concert hall, i.e. a kind of cultural
    centre. after an account of the bibliotheque nationale,
    describes the central library of the paris medical university,
    which has 2 parts-an older and an up-to-date holding. observing
    critically, the library of the paris medical university falls
    behind the more mechanised us ones but the libraries of
    hungarian medical universities have still a great deal of work
    to do to reach this 'modest' level.
