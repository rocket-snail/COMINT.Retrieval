design of transistor power amplifiers methods are
    outlined for obtaining maximum power output consistent with
    acceptable distortion factors considered include stage gain and
    power supply using values obtanable with the transistor two
    numerical examples are worked out a class a push pull grounded
    base arrangement for a low distortion af amplifier and a clas b
    grounded emitter arrangement for a output stage
