possibilities of literature supply for the training of
    pharmacists. without knowledge on literature usage,
    university-acquired knowledge will gradually vanish. since
    thesis presentation at a faculty of pharmacology is only
    necessary for a phd, tasks must be assigned which require a
    certain expertise in special literature. 1 or 2 sessions are
    inadequate to teach these skills, and lectures can only be
    influential if a good library is available to students. the
    faculty of pharmacology at szeged has an excellent library,
    whereas the budapest faculty has no real, up-to-date library. a
    solution is expected in the near future.
