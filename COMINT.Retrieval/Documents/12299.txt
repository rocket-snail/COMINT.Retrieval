power spectrum of a nonlinear oscillator with a frequency
    amplitude law perturbed by noise discussion for the case where
    the dependence of the frequency on the amplitude is represented
    by the formula and the power spectrum is determined and can be
    represented as a single line with a superposed noise spectrum
    resulting from the amplitude and phase fluctuations the methods
    previously developed and of enable the noise spectrum to be
    resolved into a continuous band and a periodic line
    component
