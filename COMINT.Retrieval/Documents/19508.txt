information and referral data: information and feedback
    from the environment. a boundary has been defined as a
    demarcation line separating an organisation from its
    environment and providing access for the transfer of
    information to and from the organisation. using a systems
    perspective, this cross-sectional exploratory survey addresses
    the question: do i&r services, occupants of boundary
    positions vis-a-vis social organisations, serve as sources of
    information inputs from the environment for country social
    service agencies? findings show that i&r data are important
    sources of information from the environment for most of the
    agencies surveyed, dependent not only on organisational
    supports but also on feedback processes that encourage
    information exchange between organisations and their
    environment. such developments must be guided by an
    understanding of the kinds of questions such data can answer
    and thoughtful analysis of the data.
