remarks on the mass energy and momentum of photons
    electrons and other elementary particles relations between the
    corpuscular velocity of a particle and the phase velocity of
    the corresponding wave are considered and the theoretical
    equivalence of particle and wave are discussed with reference
    to a possible experimental verification of the particle
    concept
