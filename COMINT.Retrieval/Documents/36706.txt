transistor power amplifiers discussion of conditions for
    junction transistors handling sinusoidal signals indicates that
    the maximum possible output is not necessarily limited by the
    maximum allowable collector dissipation limitations set by the
    cariation of current gain with emitter current become
    particularly significant in class b amplifiers because of their
    very high efficiencies push pull class b operation is preferred
    to class a of the three possible basic connections the common
    collector arrangement is preferred as providing the best
    compromise between gain and distortion and permitting the
    simplest design of output transformer no great advantage is
    found by using complementary and transistors applications
    involving nonsinusoidal signals are discussed briefly
