libraries in the faroe islands. the 1st public library in
    the faroe islands (faero county library, now called foroya
    landsbokasavn) was established in 1828. describes its
    development despite many acute problems, deterioration after
    the death of the librarian in 1878, recovery from 1920 (thanks
    to a new librarian), and movement into a new building in 1980.
    outlines the financial situation of the islands' public
    libraries and gives figures for stock, borrowers, and loans.
    draws attention to the situation of the faroese language-it was
    not taught in primary schools until this century; 80-100 books
    and some small publications are published in faroese annually;
    and most printed matter is in danish.
