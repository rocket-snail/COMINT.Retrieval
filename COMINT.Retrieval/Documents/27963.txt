time dependent electron flow general relations are given
    from which a single vector differential equation can be deduced
    which determines all possible solutions in the case of a
    constant uniform magnetic field the application of certain time
    variant solutions of this equation to anomalous behaviour in
    various magnetron type devices is considered
