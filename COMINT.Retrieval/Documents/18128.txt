solid circuits discussion of the international symposium
    on electronic components held at malvern england a solid
    circuit forming the equivalent of several transistors connected
    by resistors and capacitors is obtained by depositing films of
    conductive resistive and dielectric materials on a small block
    of semiconductor material the solution of problems regarding
    the operation of components at high temperatures is
    mentioned
