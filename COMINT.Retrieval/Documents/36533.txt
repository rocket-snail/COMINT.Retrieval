isn't it time for new frontiers for manuscripts too?. a
    seminar 'il manoscritto' situezione catalografica e proposta di
    una organizzazione della documentazione e della informazioni',
    central institute for the union catalogue rome, june 80,
    concluded unanimously that the vast inheritance of manuscripts
    in italian libraries should be brought to students' notice by
    new cataloguing methods which would transmit essential data to
    a documentation and information centre. the new methodology
    should provide collected data for each manuscript, a
    description at various levels, and centralised arrangement of
    data. adequate qualified staff will be needed to carry out the
    project. cooperation between state and region could present
    problems. an energetic cultural policy and political enthusiasm
    are essential. librarians have demonstrated a sacrificial
    willingness to break down the barriers of
    incomprehension.
