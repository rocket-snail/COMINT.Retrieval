perspectives on academic health sciences libraries in the
    1980s' indicators from a delphi study. a delphi study was
    undertaken to identify the changes in library roles and
    functions that the directors of academic health sciences
    libraries believe will occur over the next decade. the
    methodology is described and the results are summarised. 2
    scenarios resulted' one highly desirable; the other, highly
    probable, and they overlap by 64%. library directors expect
    moderate evolutionary changes in the next 10 years. users are
    perceived to be the force maintaining the status quo, while
    technology is the force advancing change. the adoption of
    technology is seen as desirable and within the libraries' span
    of control. education and service roles of librarians will
    expand. library and institutional priorities are seen as
    obstacles to change.
