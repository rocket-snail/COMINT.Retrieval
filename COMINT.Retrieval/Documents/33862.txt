transfer and transport of energy by resonance processes
    in luminescent solids experiment shows that the ratio between
    the efficiencies of activator and sensitizer fluorescence
    increases with increasing sensitizer concentration this is at
    variance with theory an explanation is given and a theory is
    developed that accounts for the temperature dependence of the
    energy transfer
