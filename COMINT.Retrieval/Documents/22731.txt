serials inventory: a case study. a serials university
    project of over 400,000 volumes was undertaken at the texas
    a&m university libraries. the inventory procedure is
    described. statistics from the inventory indicate that there is
    no cause for alarm over expensive serial volumes disappearing
    from library shelves. the successful completion of the project
    shows that an inventory of a large serials collection remains a
    sound method in managing serials collections.
