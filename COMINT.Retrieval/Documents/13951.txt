scientific research techniques. the use of 2science
    citation index1 to study the dissemination dynamics of affine
    chromatography. explores the feasibility of using 2science
    citation index1 to analyse research method transfer dynamics,
    using the example of affine chromatography. the dissemination
    of 2 versions of this technique (developed in sweden and the
    usa) is studied; the communication links used by the
    originators of the methods are uncovered; and the information
    activities carried out by the originators concerning their
    method's use in research are described. such studies could be
    used to compare the technological capacity of science in
    different countries.
