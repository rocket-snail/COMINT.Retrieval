a dynamo theory f the aurora and magnetic disturbance a
    model of the aurora is examined in which a slab of ionized air
    exists parallel to the geomagnetic field a wind of neutral
    molecules causes movement of the aurora and certain features of
    auroral and magnetic disturbances are explained
