prestel: gateway to an electronic explosion. the initial
    uk viewdata concept was of a system of powerful computers, each
    holding all the information supplied by 'information
    providers'. the west germans enhanced this concept by
    connecting their central bildschirmtext (viewdata) computers to
    'third party' (i.e. other people's) data bases. the dramatic
    results have made the uk add the german modifications to
    prestel and the new service will be available in london in
    early 1982. describes the demonstration of this 'gateway'
    concept at 2 recent uk conferences, the response, implications,
    possible further uses of gateways, and the greater use of
    viewdata in west germany than in the uk.
