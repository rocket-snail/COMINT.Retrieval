electronic systems and the future of paper and microform
    publishing. considers the 2 electronic systems now in existence
    (on-line and video-disk) and their impact on microforms and
    traditional publishing. concludes that the viability of the
    primary journal will not be seriously affected by these systems
    and that traditional paper publishing and its more recent
    adjunct, micropublishing, have a long future ahead of them
    before the newer technologies make significant inroads into
    their domain.
