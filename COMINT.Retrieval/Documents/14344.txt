is such an investigation worthy of kl?. comments on the
    report of the national association of local authorities
    (kommunernes landsforening (kl)) on the trial run of the public
    libraries' automation system, faust, in olstykke library. gives
    the reasons for the failure of faust as lack of perceived
    economic returns, opposition of the librarians' union on the
    grounds of staff reductions, and size of initial investments.
    the few librarians who pointed to improved service and
    long-term economic benefits were overruled. biblioteksdata,
    which replaced faust in 1978, is more decentralised, with
    services tailor-made to individual libraries' needs. argues
    that kl in its report dismisses the value of the trial run and
    the staff's views of the experiment, which stress the
    labour-saving effects of the automated issue control system.
    calls for central registration of public libraries' stock in
    the common data base by the library centre; then the individual
    library can begin registration of its own sto ck and start
    using automated issue control with ensuing improvements in
    service and labour economies.
