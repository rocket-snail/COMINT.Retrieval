linear power amplifiers using dynistors or trinistors the
    use of two or three terminal semiconductor switching devices
    with a pulse network in series with the output of a magnetic
    amplifier transducer acting as an amplitude phase converter is
    described these amplifiers are much smaller than conventional
    magnetic amplifiers of comparable maximum output power
    resistive or inductive loads can be used
