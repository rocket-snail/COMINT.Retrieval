multiple stratification of the f layer at ibadan
    observations made during the period december january are
    reported in the f layer there is a maximum occurrence of ridges
    around and hours the first maximum being the more pronounced a
    seasonal variation is found a maximum number of ridges around
    and hours the first maximum being the more pronounced a
    seasonal variation is found a maximum number of ridges being
    observed when the midday minimum of f occurs early in the day a
    lunar semidiurnal variation is detectable during the morning
    hours formation of ridges is also observed in the f layer but
    there is little relation to those of the flayer possible phases
    of vertical drift velocities that could explain the
    observations are discussed
