some properties of linear networks with three pairs of
    terminals and their applications in realizing negative
    impedances and negative feedback amplifiers analysis of six
    terminal networks based on a generalization of thevenins
    theorem gives a general method of circuit synthesis in which
    the prescribed impedances may have a positive or negative real
    part which is independent of the gain and internal impedance of
    the active element a method of amplifier design on this
    principle is illustrated in which input and output impedances
    are independent of the terminations at the opposite ends
