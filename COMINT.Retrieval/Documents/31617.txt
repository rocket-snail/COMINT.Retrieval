transistor high gain tuned amplifier particular attention
    has been paid to stability of gain and bandwidth against
    transistor variations over a period of months the maximum gain
    of about db has changed by only with no measurable change in
    bandwidth the amplifier has been designed principally for use
    as a bridge detector and general purpose amplifier but
    provision has also been made for transistor noise figure
    measurements by the addition of a stage at the input in which
    the transistor under test provides sufficient gain to make the
    effective noise figure of the amplifier negligible for most
    purposes
