automated information retrieval systems with direct
    access to information. (foreign press materials). discusses
    briefly the principles of on-line information retrieval systems
    and points out that on-line information retrieval is 5 to 10
    times faster than manual retrieval. lists the disadvantages of
    on-line information systems: the building of data bases is a
    complex task; duplication of information is unavoidable; the
    costs are high and staff must be trained to use these systems.
    in addition, staff must learn a number of 'command languages'
    because of the large number of on-line systems available. this
    problem could perhaps be overcome by using 'transparent
    systems' which function as an interface, or 'a translator',
    between the searcher and the machine. in this case the searcher
    would only need one command language.
