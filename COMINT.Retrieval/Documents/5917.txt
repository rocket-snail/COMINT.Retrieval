the development and work of hospital libraries and
    library services for patients, as based on the regulations of
    the ministry of health in the german democratic republic.
    library work is coordinated by district working parties, with
    special groups supervising patients' libraries in mental health
    clinics where bibliotherapy plays a prominent part. close links
    are maintained with district medical officers. some hospitals
    are still without patients' libraries and every effort is being
    made to improve the service and relationships with medical
    staff. it is important to select stock that will assist
    recovery; regular discussions are held on suitable material.
    the arrangement and appearance of patients' libraries are very
    important; old hospital buildings are often without suitable
    premises for a library. in new buildings a library room is
    always provided. in many hospitals the patients' library is
    amalgamated with the trade union library, so that extra finance
    and staff are available.
