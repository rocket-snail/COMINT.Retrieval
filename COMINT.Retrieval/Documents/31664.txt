nma, april 1980, new york: a personal view. personal
    account of the national micrographics association conference
    and exposition, new york, apr 80. the conference theme was
    'focus on productivity', although it was felt that some
    sessions had little relevance to the theme. special interest
    subjects were also covered-computer-related sessions,
    banking/finance sessions and integrated technology sessions.
    delegates were more optimistic about the future of the industry
    than are their uk counterparts. the exposition attracted about
    150 exhibitors. the prime interest was in com, and the
    exhibition was less gimmicky than expected. briefly describes
    the access system m, on display at the exhibition.
