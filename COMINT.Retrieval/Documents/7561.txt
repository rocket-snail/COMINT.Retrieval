temperature compensated dc transitor amplifier
    temperature compensated dc transistor amplifier the variation
    of transistor parameters with temperature is discussed
    compensation can be provided by using temperature sensitive
    resistors a description is given of an experimental dc
    amplifier compensated in this way
