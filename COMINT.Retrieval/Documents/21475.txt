the innovation movement in public libraries 1981-85.
    under the aegis of the east german ministry of culture, das
    zentralinstitut fur bibliothekswesen (central institute for
    library science) is organising a programme encouraging library
    staff to devise new technical aids, work processes and economic
    measures. experience has shown that such innovations can be
    applied on a scale much wider than that of the original
    concept, determining factors being the conditions, structure
    and technical level of each library. the innovation does not
    have to be a new invention but should rather be a better use of
    existing material or ideas. those testing the innovations must
    have a good knowledge of their subject. more participation must
    be encouraged from the young staff members.
