asymmetrical servomechanisms servomechanisms in which the
    nonlinear element has an input output characteristic asymmetric
    with respect to the origin are considered even if the input
    signal is a pure sine wave the output will have a dc component
    that cannot be filtered out by the linear element the general
    feedback loop equations are reformulated and the new conditions
    of stability considered a temperature control device is treated
    a as an example
