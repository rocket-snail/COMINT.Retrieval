electron currents in thin oxide films on aluminium at low
    electric field intensities the electron current in films formed
    on al in suitable electrolytes depends on the temperature and
    on the hyperbolic sine of the product of the field strength and
    a constant dependent on barrier dimensions the oxide film
    barrier height and trough to peak width are ev and respectively
    the theoretical current voltage curves given show good
    agreement with experimental results the origin of the electron
    current and the presence of trapped charges in the oxide layer
    near the electrolyte surface are discussed
