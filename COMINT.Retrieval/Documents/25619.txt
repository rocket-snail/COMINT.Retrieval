studies on the disturbances in f layer associated with
    geomagnetic disturbances f layer disturbances associated with
    geomagnetic storms consist of two components which is effective
    only in the earlier stage and is dependent on longitude and
    which begins simultaneously with the f storm and gradually
    grows to large amplitude hours later variations with latitude
    and season are plotted from world wide data for the period the
    disturbances follow the trend of geomagnetic activity except
    for in winter the effect of sunspot activity is shown
