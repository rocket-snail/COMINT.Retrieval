quantum theory of a damped electrical oscillator and
    noise field quantization is applied to an electrical
    oscillating circuit damping effects are treated by perturbation
    theory quantum effects occur both in the damping and in the
    noise and are discussed in detail the vacuum fluctuations are
    shown to be observable in certain low temperature noise
    experiments
