the diffraction of electromagnetic waves by a semi
    infinite circular waveguide formulae are obtained for the
    currents on the waveguide and asymptotic expressions are
    derived for the longitudinal components of the electric and
    magnetic vectors in the waveguide at large distances from the
    mouth
