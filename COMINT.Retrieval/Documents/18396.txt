problems in the standardisation of title entries in
    cataloguing networks. the development of a central title
    catalogue free of redundancies, and in which titles with
    multiple locational references occur only once, is possible
    within a cooperative cataloguing network, where the work load
    is distributed only through standardisation of the entry form.
    to achieve this, the detection and prevention of multiple
    references is especially important. describes the current
    status of network cataloguing in west germany, the
    monograph-cataloguing networks in north rhine westphalia,
    bavaria, and oclc. the more intensive investigation of these
    problems which thereby become apparent, regarding the
    establishment of uniform title entries, takes into account the
    technical aspects of data processing, specific library aspects,
    and organisational problems. thus can a realistic appraisal of
    the possibilities of using data processing in libraries be
    achieved.
