design considerations for direct coupled transistor
    amplifiers it is shown that the maximum obtainable signal drift
    ratio of an amplifier is achieved by choosing the optimum
    source resistance the signal drift capability of a transistor
    and the optimum source resistance are nearly the same for the
    three configurations common emitter common collector and common
    base negative feedback can change the optimum source resistance
    and generally degrades the signal drift ratio improved signal
    drift ratio can be obtained at reduced emitter currents
