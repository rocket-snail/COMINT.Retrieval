are subject information centres the modern information
    source for everyone?. lecture given in bonn to a study group
    for archives, libraries and documentation centres (n.d.)the
    federal government's information and documentation programme
    has as its focal point the foundation of 16 centralised subject
    information centres between 1974 and 1977. this initial stage
    is not yet completed owing to lack of funds; only 3 centres are
    fully operational. the adequacy of these centres has been
    questioned, especially because of the emphasis on
    centralisation and the introduction of market economy
    principles; information stored might be selected mainly to suit
    industry. it is not yet known whether libraries must contribute
    towards costs, which will be expensive. trade unionists fear
    that the advanced technology in the centres will result in
    staff stress and that centralisation will reduce
    employment.
