the dynamic behaviour of servomechanisms using thyratrons
    if the response of the servomechanism is linear the self
    inductance of the motor armature may be ignored in calculating
    the transfer constant of the system for discontinuous operation
    in continuous operation it must be taken into account a method
    of calculating the transfer function is presented for the
    general case of nonlinear operation but the formulae involved
    are cumbersome and an experimental approach may be
    preferable
