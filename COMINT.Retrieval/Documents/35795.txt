a method for the measurement of the distance of radio
    stars the method described depends on the absorption of the
    radiation from the radio stars by interstellar hydrogen at a
    frequency of about preliminary results are given for the two
    intense sources in cygnus and cassiopeia the distance of the
    former is parsecs that of the latter is probably between and
    parsecs the uncertainty will be reduced when more accurate
    measurements are made of the absorption spectrum
