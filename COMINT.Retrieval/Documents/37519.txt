high current superconductivity the barden cooper and
    schrieffer theory of superconductivity is extended to the case
    of high current densities by explicitly including in the phonon
    induced electron electron attraction the modification of the
    phonon spectrum in a moving coordinate system this modification
    results from the doppler effect
