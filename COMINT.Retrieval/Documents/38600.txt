presidential address. the quality of public library
    services in scotland will be greatly assisted by good
    legislation together with comprehensive standards which are
    constantly reviewed. outlines the limitations of the library
    cooperation committee of the national library of scotland and
    recommends the setting up of an advisory panel similar to the
    library advisory councils in england and wales which could
    provide encouragement and assistance to authorities in
    fulfilling their statutory obligations. an adequately staffed
    scottish library association would provide the necessary backup
    for librarians in the field and would be able to communicate
    the opinion of the profession much more effectively to the
    scottish office and a scottish library advisory council.
    stresses the initiative, commitment and ability needed in
    librarians at the point of service.
