a wide range oscillator of high stability description of
    a beat frequency oscillator for the rf system of the birmingham
    university proton synchrotron of hibbard the two similar
    oscillators used are tuned by coaxial resonators on rubber
    shock mounts in a constant temperature enclose the fixed
    frequency oscillator operating at about a capacitor using a
    single plate rotor with a stepped profile serves for varying
    the tuning of the other oscillator via a servomechanism the
    beat frequency as a function of rotor setting is reproducible
    to within throughout the range
