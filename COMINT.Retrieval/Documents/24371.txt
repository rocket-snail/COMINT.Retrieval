initiation of discharges at electrical conta ts the
    experimental investigation described deals with discharges
    between low power contacts w th special attention to the cases
    of make and break at medium voltage the discharges were found
    to be initiated by a cold field emission of electrons govenred
    by the nature of the surface tarnish layers the influence of
    the gas atmosphere was examined a theory of the mechanism is
    outlined
