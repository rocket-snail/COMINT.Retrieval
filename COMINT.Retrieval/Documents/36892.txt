electrostatic averaged boundary conditions for wire mesh
    a brief review is given of the existing methods for determining
    the screening effect of a mesh and a general derivation is
    proposed of the boundary condition for a mesh by the method of
    averaging the field the results obtained are applied to the
    determination of the screening effect of an earthed uniform
    spherical mesh with respect to a charge or a dipole placed at
    the centre and also to the determination of the effective
    potential in a triode see also below
