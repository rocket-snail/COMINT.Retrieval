bibliographic organisation of u.s. federal depository
    collections. the government printing office projects a 10%
    annual increase in sales over five years. research on
    accessibility to federal documents is small. this mail survey,
    conducted in 1979-1980, sought to provide reliable data on
    staff size and type, collection size and arrangement, and
    methods employed to provide descriptive and subject access to
    federal documents in the depository system. results indicated
    that on the average about 40% of depository items were being
    selected yearly and arranged in some form of separate
    collection. 1 in 4 libraries does not provide any descriptive
    access; less than 6% of the libraries provide some subject
    access. computer technology (particularly in the form of
    on-line bibliographic services) is modestly used; only 1/3 of
    the respondents indicated such services were available. there
    is no clear relationship between increased selection of federal
    documents and increased use of on-line service s, except in
    those libraries claiming totally separate collections.
