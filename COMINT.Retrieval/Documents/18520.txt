a rigorous treatment of the diffraction of electro
    magnetic waves by a slit wave polarization components parallel
    to and perpendicular to the slit are considered an integral
    equation for the electric field strength in the slit is found
    by the method of levine and schwinger and of and an exact
    solution is obtained by developing the kernel in a power series
    of the product of wave number and slit width the far field
    intensity and the transmission factor of the slit are
    calculated and compared with the results of morse and
    rubenstein of the relation of the work to that of sommerfeld
    vorlesung uber theoretische physik and of groschwitz and honl
    is discussed
