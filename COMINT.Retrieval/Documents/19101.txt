applications of the piezoelectric equations of state
    application of the general linear piezoelectric equations of
    state of to plates and thin bars particular stress and strain
    systems are considered a uniform notation is introduced for the
    elastic and piezoelectric constants used the relation between
    dielectric constant at constant stress and at constant strain
    is investigated electromechanical coupling factor is
    discussed
