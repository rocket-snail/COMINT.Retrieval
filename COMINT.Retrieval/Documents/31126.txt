our own children's magazines: insuring their future. if
    canadian children's magazines are to remain 'alive', librarians
    and administrators must promote cultural and educational
    objectives in the way they respond to them. the library
    community responds favourably to children's magazines, but only
    a minority of the country's school children has access to them
    in their school library.
