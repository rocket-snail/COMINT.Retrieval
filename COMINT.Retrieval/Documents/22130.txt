arc arc inductance and dynatron capacitance the stability
    of systems with nonlinear negative resistances of arc and
    dynatron types is discussed analysis indicates that though the
    arc can have e some inductive po properties and the dynatron
    capacitive ones these are not essential to an explanation of
    the behaviour of the systems transient conditions and steady
    oscillation states are considered
