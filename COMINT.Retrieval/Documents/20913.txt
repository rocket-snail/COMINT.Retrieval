an analysis of bursts of solar radio emission and their
    association with solar and terrestrial phenomena solar radio
    emission records on seven frequencies in the range were studied
    over a period of months the analysis which includes a number of
    histograms shows that many of the properties of bursts change
    with frequency a study of the time delay between bursts on
    different frequencies revealed that bursts often occur first a
    simultaneous up and down movement of ionized material from the
    level of zero refractive index at that frequency is postulated
    it is found that bursts were more frequent than flares fadeouts
    and crochets and that they almost always accompanied these
    effects the commencement of bursts appears to be simultaneous
    with that of flares and crochets but precedes that of fadeouts
    by about two minutes in addition there is a rough correlation
    between the intensity of bursts flares fadeouts and
    crochets
