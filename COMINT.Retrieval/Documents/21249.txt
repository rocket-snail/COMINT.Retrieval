lobbying for libraries. interviews eileen cooke, leader
    of the american library association's washington office. the
    office was established in 1945. it has helped to bring about
    the library services and construction act, which has been
    responsible for the building of many new libraries. but the
    passing of the act does not ensure actual payment of grants to
    the individual states. for this to happen, persistent lobbying
    of the congress committee is necessary. the office keeps
    interested congress representatives informed of library issues,
    follows the legislative process in relevant areas, and briefs
    members before hearings, but it is not allowed, nor does it
    seek to, give financial support to individual candidates'
    election campaigns.
