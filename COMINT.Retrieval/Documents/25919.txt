optical electromagnetic and satellite observations of
    high altitude nuclear detonations part the radio effects of the
    argus detonations were measured using mcs radars designed to
    obtain echoes from the aurora or from the earths surface
    mirrored in an enhanced ionospheric layer vlf receivers for
    monitoring distant transmitters or atmospheric noise sources in
    search of changes in signal strength riometers for recording
    cosmic noise absorption or vhf shot created noise at and mcs
    results included auroral echoes in the vicinity of the launch
    point after all three shots and near the conjugate points after
    the first and th d shot sudden depressions of to db of the
    signal from england at madrid and the azores no ionospheric
    absorption at the conjugate location
