stabilized dc supplies using grid controlled rectifiers
    circuits using magnitude controlled thyratrons are discussed
    these are suitable for hv power supplies where the load is
    reasonably constant and the output voltage regulation is not
    required to be better than within about a unit incorporating
    two type miniature thyratrons can supply at
