bibliographic control of microforms' suggestions for
    improved local access. providing complete analytics for
    microform collections is more the ideal rather than the reality
    for most libraries. even with partially analysed collections,
    however, libraries can improve access and publicise the extent
    of their holdings through a number of bibliographic aids. these
    aids include labelling microform bibliographies, placing
    plastic overlays on catalogue cards, annotating short title
    catalogues, and compiling guidebooks to major microform
    collections.
