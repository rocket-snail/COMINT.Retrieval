turkish library developments. the important role of
    library science came to be gradually appreciated in turkey only
    in the 1940s when adnan otuken returned from library science
    studies in germany. determined to make librarianship a
    recognised profession, he campaigned for a national library
    (established in 1946), taught library science (basis of
    department of library science at ankara university), and helped
    found the turkish library association in 1949. public and
    children's libraries have increased in numbers in the last
    decade (244 to 700 and 174 to 400). their problems include lack
    of trained staff and the 180,000 manuscripts and rare books in
    their care. university library development has been uneven and
    school libraries are most neglected. turdok (national
    documentation centre for science and technology) was
    established in 1966. library education programmes have been
    established.
