a self consistent calculation of the dissociation of
    oxygen in the upper atmosphere part three body recombinations
    continuation of work noted in of results based on the
    assumption that recombination occurs mainly as a three body
    nonradiative process indicate that dissociation occurs at a
    level about higher than that previously calculated
