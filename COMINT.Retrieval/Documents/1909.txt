between the atmospherics an examination is made of the
    background cosmic radiation between atmospherics at a frequency
    of records are explained in terms of an ionospheric shutter
    operated by two mechanisms d region absorption by day and shift
    of coupling level between ordinary and extraordinary modes
    relative to the gyro level at night observations of
    precipitation static and local atmospherics are also
    described
