the height of the atmospheric electric equilibrium layer
    continuation of previous work by israel and kasemir the values
    of electron concentration corresponding to two limiting
    assumptions regarding dependence of recombination coefficient
    on pressure are compared with values deduced fro determinations
    of d layer ionization is found to be proportional to the cube
    root of the pressure the height of the equilibrium layer is
    about km
