public libraries and adult education associations in
    cooperation. the adult education movement built up libraries at
    the beginning of the 20th century, but when these were
    transferred to the municipal libraries, the connection between
    the organisations and libraries largely ceased. conscious of
    this, orebro regional library in conjunction with 4 public
    libraries and 4 adult education associations drew up a project
    supported by the cultural council for an experimental period of
    1 year, with a part-time librarian as organiser. the aim was to
    establish contact with the leaders, examine the associations'
    needs and how the library could meet them. direct contact with
    the class leaders proved difficult and advance notice of books
    needed hard to obtain. study visits to the library were made by
    some groups, and special and background literature was lent to
    the groups on long loans. concludes that the libraries often
    lacked staff and time to take the necessary initiatives, and
    that the study grou p leader is the key to any fruitful
    contact.
