the ignition voltage of gas discharges in a transverse
    magnetic field over the pressure range torr experiments were
    made using a discharge space bounded by coaxial cylinders with
    a coaxial magnetic field a voltage of was sufficient to start a
    discharge at torr with a suitable magnetic field strength on
    the basis of these measurements and those of other workers
    expressions are derived relating ignition voltage to magnetic
    field strength electrode separation and configuration electrode
    material nature and pressure of the gas above a critical value
    of torr cm for air the magnetic field raises the ignition
    voltage below this critical value the magnetic field reduces
    the ignition voltage
