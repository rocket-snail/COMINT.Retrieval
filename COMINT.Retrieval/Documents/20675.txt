quantum effects in the interaction between electrons and
    high frequency field part reported an analysis of the effect of
    the interaction on the motion of the electrons the effect on
    the field in the resonant cavity is now analysed the value of
    the field strength differs from the classical value by a small
    amount due to the wave properties of the electrons the
    dispersion in the field is evaluated and the number of
    electrons required in a bunch to produce a field comparable to
    the dispersion is calculated for typical experimental
    conditions the highest frequency at which this requirement can
    be met is of the order
