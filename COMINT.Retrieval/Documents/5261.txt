thermionic emission field emission and the transition
    region the combined thermionic and field emission from a metal
    is studied as a whole a general expression is derived in the
    form of a definite integral relating the emission current to
    the field the temperature and the work function modified forms
    of the richardson schottky and fowler nordheim formulae are
    shown to be respectively valid over limited regions of low
    field and high temperature on the one hand and low temperatures
    and high field on the other and expression is also derived for
    the emission current in the transition region
