synthesis of passive networks with pairs of terminals
    specified by their scattering matrices the method described
    gives results different from those of belevitch of and back
    references equivalent networks are represented by means of a
    uniquely defined regular network matrix necessary and
    sufficient conditions for minimum phase shift are specified in
    terms of matrix theory and the minimum number of elements
    excepting ideal transformers required in equivalent networks is
    determined relevant matrix theory is dealt with in an appendix
    the method is extended to networks violating the reciprocity
    principle
