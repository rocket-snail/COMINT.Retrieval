storm phenomena in the ionosphere recent advances in our
    knowledge of f layer ionospheric perturbations accompanying a
    magnetic storm are summarized the diurnal control is shown and
    differences between phenomena at high medium and low latitudes
    are noted for medium latitudes the effect of a storm is to
    exaggerate the geomagnetic distortion of the f layer already
