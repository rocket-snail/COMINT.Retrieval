documentation of the united nations system; results of a
    survey, and consequent recommendations. much of the material in
    this article was previously presented as part of a paper
    prepared for the 2nd world symposium on international
    documentation, brussels, 20-22 june 80. summarises the findings
    of a survey of the status of bibliographic control of the
    publications on un organisations. describes the main types of
    bibliographic tools by which un organisations announce their
    publications, and analyses the coverage provided by these
    tools. highlights the need for the coordination and integration
    of bibliographic production, and suggests the following
    specific steps which could be taken towards this coordination'
    the utilisation of on-line services and word processing
    capabilities; the involvement of publication units;
    prioritising coverage of the data base; deciding on essential
    elements of bibliographic description; and
    cataloguing-in-publication.
