standards for public library services: reactions to a
    report (3). parts 1 and 2 of this article appeared in
    bibliotheek en samenleving 9 (2) feb 81, 46-51 and 9 (3) mar
    81, 80-85 respectively. the recommended standards for public
    libraries, which were published recently in the netherlands by
    the nederlands bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for
    libraries and literature), has aroused much opposition from
    local authorities. the report was submitted by the nblc to the
    government, which is responsible for only 20% of public library
    finance. the local authorities, which are responsible for the
    remaining 80%, will be required to raise large sums of money
    from local taxation to meet the recommended standards.
