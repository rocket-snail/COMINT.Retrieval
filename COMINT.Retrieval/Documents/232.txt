user education in academic libraries' a century in
    retrospect. contribution to a thematic issue on library issue
    instruction. examines the subject of user education in us
    academic libraries from its historical perspective. credits
    ralph waldo emerson with formulating the basic concept of
    library instruction, and intertwines the development of
    educational thought and philosophy with an increasing
    consciousness of the need of users to understand libraries.
    considers the importance of early 20th century experiments with
    library user instruction, and reviews some of the conflicts
    which emerged as stronger assertations were made in favour of
    this instruction. argues that there is a continuing lack of
    sound philosophical and theoretical foundations to support the
    movement for library user instruction.
