antimetric ladder filters all parameters of a quadripole
    antimetric ladder filter are shown to depend on four polynomial
    functions of being the complex angular frequency between which
    a relation exists the theory is applied to antimetric band
    rejection filters and to high and low pass filters and tables
    are given facilitating calculations
