frequency stability of point contact transistor
    oscillators the duality relation between circuits using the
    voltage controlled negative impedance base input characteristic
    and those using the current controlled negative impedance
    emitter input or collector input characteristic is demonstrated
    stabilization criteria for both cases are derived analytically
    and are confirmed experimentally
