daytime and night time atmospheric properties derived
    from rocket and satellite observations a summary of the values
    of atmospheric density obtained during the interval from
    rockets and satellites is presented and is fitted into a model
    atmosphere obtained by integrating the hydrostatic equation a
    general decrease since in atmospheric density at all z
    altitudes is confirmed
