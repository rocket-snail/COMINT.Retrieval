local and regional collections. text of a 1978 conference
    paper discussing organisation and management policies.
    considers firstly the materials constituting a local collection
    in relation to geographical relevance and criteria for
    selection' works by local authors, produced by local printers,
    or dealing with local subjects, are considered, as well as
    official administrative publications and ephemera. then
    problems of exploitation and conservation are examined, in an
    attempt to reconcile archival responsibilities with user needs'
    the range of potential users, from scholarly researchers to
    interested non-specialists, is discussed in relation to
    preparation of bibliographical tools permitting multiple access
    to the collection to cater for varied approaches; basic
    commonsense precautions are suggested for minimising damage to
    book materials, and special measures for minor documents
    proposed. emphasises that each librarian must evolve his own
    policy to meet his own particular situation.
