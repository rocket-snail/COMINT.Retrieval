recombination and diffusion and spread echoes from the
    ionosphere the inclusion of a diffusion term in the
    differential equation of layer formation to account for
    ionization due to the influx of charged particles leads to a
    solution in terms of a doubly periodic elliptic function this
    solution indicates the possibility of a periodic variation of
    ionic density within the f layer such as to account for spread
    echoes which have been observed layers produced by ultra violet
    radiation are many wavelengths thick those due to particle
    ionization are only two or three wavelengths thick and are
    embedded in the background of ionization the existence of
    auroral curtains provides further evidence of ionization by
    particles
