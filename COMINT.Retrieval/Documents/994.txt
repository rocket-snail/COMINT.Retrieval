a panoramic ionospheric recorder for the study of
    travelling disturbances in the ionosphere a description is
    given of a recorder covering the frequency range in or sec this
    is achieved by heterodyning an oscillator which is continuously
    variable from to with a pulsed oscillator and amplifying the
    resultant pulsed signal to provide the transmitter output the
    same variable oscillator is used in the superheterodyne
    receiver a block diagram of the recorder is given and typical
    records are shown both single records on mm film and continuous
    records on mm film moving at or in min can be made using cr
    tubes with long and short persistence screens
    respectively
