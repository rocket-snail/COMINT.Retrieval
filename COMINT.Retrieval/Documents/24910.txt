statistical study of electron avalanches in gaseous
    discharge for low pressures the pulse size distribution at
    potentials below the breakdown value agreed with that given by
    the townsend theory assuming the absence of space charge at
    atmospheric pressure the discharge was modified probably by
    space charge and pulse size tended to become uniform
