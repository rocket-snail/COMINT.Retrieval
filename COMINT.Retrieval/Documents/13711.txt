the parallel t resistance capacitance network analysis is
    given for the general case of finite source and load
    resistances when these two resistances are appropriately
    related the network loss is the same at low and high
    frequencies the transfer characteristic is then a circle in the
    complex plane this symmetrical networks is equivalent to a
    simple series resonant circuit as regards its transfer
    characteristic
