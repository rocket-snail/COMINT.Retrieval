a highlight in the middle franconian library scene. in
    1981 a new combined gymnasium (grammar school) and public
    library was opened at gunzenhausen, in the weissenburg library
    system. since the old premises were too small, a new library
    was made from a former hospital building next door to the
    school library. near the entrance is the information centre,
    with the issue system and 25 study places near the reference
    works. the non-fiction, arranged in broad subject groups and
    the audio centre, where cassettes and music books are shelved
    together, are nearby. a 2nd room contains adult fiction and
    literature for young children and teenagers. there is a special
    seating area for children, with headphone sets and troughs for
    picture books. stocks total 18,000 volumes.
