broad band parametric amplifiers by simple experimental
    techniques maximum use is made of the parasitic elements of the
    varactor diode and simple measurements enable the diode unit
    with the best characteristics to be chosen the pass band
    characteristics of diode mount combinations are also measured
    single channel gain band width products approaching have been
    achieved
