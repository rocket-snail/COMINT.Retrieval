methods of reference in cassiodorus. paper presented at
    library history seminar vi 'libraries & culture', austin,
    texas, 19-22 mar 80. the 2psalm commentary, 1by the 6th-century
    latin church father, cassiodorus, used a type of format created
    by the author himself-one never to be used again in the history
    of the mediaeval book. shows how, through the organisation of
    the book and by the use of marginal symbols, cassiodorus was
    able to present to his students a handbook from which they
    could learn the rudiments of the liberal arts through the study
    of divine scripture. the book constitutes a self-help manual,
    with the narrator speaking directly to the reader. critical
    marks were added to specific places in the text to allow the
    reader to study whatever he wants in the text, simply by
    locating like symbols.
