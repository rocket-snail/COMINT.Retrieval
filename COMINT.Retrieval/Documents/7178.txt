ionospheric wind determination from spaced radio receiver
    fading records direct analysis of the fading patterns of
    reflected signals at three spaced receivers can indicate the
    true ionospheric wind and changes in orientation of the
    patterns without assuming any particular distribution of
    orientation a new method of analysis of the fading records is
    proposed together with an alternative method of observation in
    which a single fixed receiver is used in conjunction with a
    second one which is moved in a circle round the first
