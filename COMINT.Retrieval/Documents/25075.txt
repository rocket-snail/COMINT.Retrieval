the case of the missing subtitle. with reference to the
    relevant passages in aacr2 and isbd(g), notes the elimination
    of the term 'subtitle' and the resultant difficulties.
    subtitles will not disappear just because they are no longer
    called by that name. the term must be reinstated in the
    official vocabulary of cataloguing and operational definitions
    of 'title proper' and 'subtitle' formulated. such action would
    go a long way towards uniform implementation of the rules,
    leaving much less to the individual interpretation of the
    catalogues and resulting in greater entry
    standardisation.
