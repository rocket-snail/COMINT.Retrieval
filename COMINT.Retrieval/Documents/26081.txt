the bibliographic presentation of grey literature. the
    primary communications research centre, leicester, uk, was
    commissioned to study the bibliographic presentation of grey
    literature and prepare basic guidelines for presentation in a
    form capable of being widely advertised and used within the
    european economic community. findings indicate considerable
    room for improvement in the bibliographic information offered
    by grey literature; a need for improvement in the use of colour
    (especially on covers) and binding; and a fundamental
    difference in the desire for guidelines-document retrievers see
    a need for guidelines, whereas report-producers see the present
    situation as adequate and do not readily accept the notion of
    guidelines.
