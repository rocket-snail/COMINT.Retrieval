an even harmonic magnetic amplifier the circuit is an
    adaptation of the inverter described by frost smith a typical
    figure for the power gain and for the output the zero drift is
    less than the shift produced by an input power of the input
    impedance ranges up to about making it suitable for use iwth
    many types of transducer but the poor response time restricts
    application to cases where the input varies slowly multistage
    amplifiers of this type are useful for control and measurement
    purposes
