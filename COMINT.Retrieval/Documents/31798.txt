parallel connected magnetic amplifier a mathematical
    analysis of parallel connected magnetic amplifiers with an
    inductive and capacitive load is presented the analysis is
    based on the representation of the normal magnetization curve
    of the core material by polynomials of thiod and fifth degree
    respectively
