new theorems on the electrostatic field the law of least
    capacitance is discussed the concept of the intermediate
    electrode is introduced to facilitate the formulation a system
    of two cylinders with parallel axes is considered and an
    examination is made of the variation of the total capacitance
    of the system on dis placing the imaginary intermediate
    electrode constituted by an infinitely thin metal sheet shaped
    to coincide with one of the equipotential surfaces the analysis
    is extended to systems of spheres and other geometrical forms
    formulae giving attractive and repulsive forces for numerous
    particular cases are tabulated
