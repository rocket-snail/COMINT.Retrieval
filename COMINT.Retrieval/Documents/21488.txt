a living-room for the whole town. a report on nakskov new
    main library, a combined public and school library. the 3190
    sq.m. area is split up by shelves, moveable partition walls and
    4 large garden areas. although the prime function is to be a
    public library, an agreement with the adjacent educational
    centre, housing commercial, technical and senior secondary
    schools, allows the centre use of the library against a payment
    of 300,000 kr. annually to be used partly on salary to a
    librarian. it is hoped that the specialised material to be
    acquired for the students will also benefit the public and that
    the 130 seat theatre hall will attract a ready audience from
    the schools. interviews with librarians reveal determination to
    protect the interests of the general public and by placement of
    the educational department furthest away avoid dominance by the
    student users.
