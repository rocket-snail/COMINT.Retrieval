composite cores for instrument transductors the
    characteristics of self excited transducers are markedly
    dependent on the properties of the core material cores with
    satisfactory properties can be produced at reasonable cost by
    combining different materials experimental results are reported
    for a core comprising a mumetal bridge and a u shaped grain
    oriented si fe yoke
