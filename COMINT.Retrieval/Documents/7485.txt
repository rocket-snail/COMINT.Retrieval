four terminal networks a rigorous theory of passive
    quadripoles in the steady state is presented the general
    quadripole is regarded as consistent of n meshes and the
    equations for the system as a whole are obtained by solving the
    equations for the meshes iterative and image impedances are
    obtained as properties of a single quadripole and a suitable
    propagation function is associated with each pair of impedances
    conditions in quadripoles in two types of cascade arrangement
    can be deduced immediately from the equations for a single
    quadripole tables are included giving expressions for the image
    functions in terms of the iterative functions and vice versa
    and giving the equations of the quadripole in terms of the
    iterative and image functions
