redistribution alone of the library school's resources
    does not make a summer. comments on a report of the working
    party on the danish library school issued by the government's
    department of administration. the report examines proposals for
    changes in the library school act. the proposals concern a
    common basic training for librarians, the need for
    post-graduate training and the organisation and content of
    courses. future demand and supply of librarians are estimated.
    it is proposed to establish a section for the basic education
    and another for the other courses. an education council,
    appointed by the ministry of culture, with representatives for
    all interested organisations is suggested. research is given
    higher priority, especially that leading to development for the
    fundamental library subjects. the report recognises the
    development within information and documentation, but expects
    this to take place through change in the priorities of the
    school's expenditure on present tasks and sees allocation of
    additional resources as politically unrealistic.
