day variations in the absorption of the d region of the
    ionosphere over singapore and slough apreciable variations of d
    layer rf absorption with a day period are found throughout the
    year at singapore but only during the u summer months at slough
    other variations of absorption of larger amplitude than in
    summer are found at slouth in the winter months but are not
    related to the solar rotation period of variations of particle
    radiation the bearing of these results on radio communication
    and on ionospheric forecasting is discussed briefly see also
