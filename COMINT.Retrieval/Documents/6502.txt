disturbances of the ionospheric f region associated with
    geomagnetic storms part auroral latitudes results of a
    statistical treatment show that the deviation of f on a
    disturbed day is similar to the negative disturbance in middle
    latitudes see part of january the deviation of is different
    main features of the f disturbances can be accounted for by
    vertical electron drift
