the effect of series resistance on photovoltaic solar
    energy conversion the series resistance in a photovoltaic cell
    is divided into two components contact and sheet resistance
    each of the components is examined theoretically and
    experimentally and qualitative agreement between theory and
    experiment is shown it is concluded that contact resistance
    reduces the conversion efficiency more than sheet
    resistance
