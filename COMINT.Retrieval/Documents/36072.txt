qualified staff-a basic factor of further development in
    public libraries. volunteers in public libraries cannot keep
    pace with the constant increasing demands from the readers.
    thus the number of public libraries professionally staffed is
    steadily rising and at present is 4 times higher compared to
    1957 and the number of qualified librarians is nearly 9 times
    higher. during the past 14 years the readership in libraries
    run by volunteers increased by 7.5% while in those run by
    qualified staff it increased by 163%. the number of loans in
    libraries staffed by part-time workers increase twice while in
    libraries with qualified staff it increased 4 times. these are
    only 2 examples of how qualified staff contributed to the
    effectiveness of the library and information services. however,
    for the time being, the volunteers will be maintained due to
    the present situation.
