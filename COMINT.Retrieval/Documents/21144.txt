modes of operation of a valve oscillator the operation of
    a tuned grid oscillator is described mathematically by the
    differential equation where is proportional to the capacitor
    voltage is the derivative of the anode current with respect to
    and and are constants dependent on the circuit parameters the
    equation is solved assuming to be small
