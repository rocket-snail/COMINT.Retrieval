the attainment of very high gain with unmatched
    transistors when a transistor is used with unmatched source or
    load impedance maximum gain is achieved with a particular value
    of the impedance maximum gain is achieved with a particular
    value of the impedance on the other side quadripole analysis is
    used to determine this optimum impedance value with grounded
    base or grounded emitter circuits the cut off frequency is the
    same as with matched impedance with grounded collector circuits
    the cut off frequency depends on the degree of matching
