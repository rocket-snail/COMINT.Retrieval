vestmannaeyjar public library' fragments from the history
    of an icelandic public library. the vestmannaeyjar public
    library has had to struggle against poverty, lack of
    understanding, and ultimately to struggle for survival. a
    long-standing struggle for proper library premises has taken
    place; the library, having few means, was moved from 1
    temporary place to another until it could be moved into a new
    building in 1970. in feb 73 a volcanic eruption hit the heimaey
    and destroyed the library, but the books were rescued. it is
    thought the library is the only 1 in the world to be rescued
    from volcanic eruption.
