application of delayed feedback in electronic circuits a
    short general theory is given of a method of generating
    periodic signals of controlled shape two simple applications of
    a delay line aa feedback loop are given the signal frequency
    depends on the delay time and under certain conditions on the
    triggering frequency and this provides a method measuring the
    delay time of an element in the feedback loop
