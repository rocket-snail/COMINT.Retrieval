two electrode high frequency discharge at pressures from
    to atmospheric an experimental investigation is reported of
    discharges in nitrogen and argon at frequencies of to and
    variation of running voltage with electrode separation and
    variation of electric field with pressure are shown graphically
    and photographs of discharges are reproduced
