modified magic tee phase shifter for microwaves the
    modified unit described has the symmetrical arms parallel to
    each other thus allowing both short circuiting plungers to be
    linked to a common drive the e and h plane arms are replaced by
    odd and even coupling slots owing to the existence of several
    sources of impedance mismatch in the complete phase shifter
    which uses a second magic t junction a special alignment
    procedure is necessary
