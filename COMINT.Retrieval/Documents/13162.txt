limits of practical application of pisarenkos formula
    pisarenkos formula expresses thermoelectric power in terms of
    charge carrier concentration and effective mass and of absolute
    temperature a constant factor is included to take account of
    scattering of the charge carriers in the crystal lattice
    calculations show that the errors are small up to carrier
    concentrations of about atomic lattice and ionic lattice
    crystals the errors are discussed and compared with those of
    other formulae results are tabulated
