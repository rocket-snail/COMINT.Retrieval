studies of externally heated hot cathode arcs part plasma
    density distributions in the anode glow mode analysis of the
    plasma density distributions indicates that the anode glow mode
    can exist only if the emission capacity of the cathode is at
    least twice as great as the anode current this is supported by
    experimental evidence part
