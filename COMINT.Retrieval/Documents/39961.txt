recombination in the lower ionosphere observations of
    phase height polarization and absorption at are analysed to
    estimate the distribution of recombination coefficient over the
    altitude range theories of recombination are examined on the
    basis of this distribution recombination during the day and
    during sudden ionospheric disturbances is considered night time
    recombination is not dealt with the experimental results are
    consistent with negative ion theory for altitudes up to about
    above the predominant process must be dissociative
    recombination with an effective coefficient of about there is
    no evidence of an increase of recombination coefficient during
    disturbances
