some results on the cross capacitances per unit length of
    cylindrical three terminal capacitors with thin dielectric
    films on their electrodes the concept of power at complex
    frequencies the significance of the term negative resistance is
    discussed with regard to two different aspects one is the
    behaviour of twopole networks with sinusoidal oscillators and a
    negative slope characteristic the other is the case of
    exponentially decaying oscillations where phase shifts greater
    between current and voltage may arise
