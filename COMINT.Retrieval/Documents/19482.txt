for greater efficiency of regional library services.
    compared with 1939, there are 4 times as many libraries in
    bulgaria catering for 32 times as many readers. book
    collections-almost 83 million volumes at present-have increased
    34 times. bulgaria comes 5th in the world as to the number of
    books per head of population. in spite of these encouraging
    statistics, the state control committee made an investigation
    recently into the structure, organisation and efficiency of
    library services in 7 regions. the availability of public,
    school and trade union libraries varied greatly. inhabitants on
    some of the new housing estates have been deprived up to now of
    any kind of library services. there were cases of haphazard
    opening and/or closing of libraries. there is still a lack of
    information and reference services, shortages in consistent
    cataloguing and proper upkeep of rarities, recovery of overdue
    books, as well as inadequate audio-visual and reprographic
    equipment. better planning for acquisiti ons, and also more
    considerate discarding of obsolete items are most desirable.
    the committee's findings will be presented to local government
    and other relevant bodies whose members have to take a much
    more active interest in libraries in their regions, in
    particular in rural areas.
