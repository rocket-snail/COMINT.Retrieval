the graphical distribution of the harmonics of the annual
    variation in the critical frequency of the layer at noon the
    annual change in noon at stations has been represented in terms
    of the first and second harmonics and a constant term the term
    the first harmonic usually has the same sign in both north and
    south hemispheres and in the origin of the winter anomaly in
    the northern hemisphere the amplitude of the second harmonic is
    greater than expected
