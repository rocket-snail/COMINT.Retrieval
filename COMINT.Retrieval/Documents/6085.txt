ionospheric current systems of ten igy solar flare
    effects the current systems consist of two vortices one on each
    side of the magnetic equator the m northern vortex is centred
    west of the southern one and is more intense in local summer
    than the southern one the asymmetry in the vortices can be
    described in terms of an ionospheric current system
