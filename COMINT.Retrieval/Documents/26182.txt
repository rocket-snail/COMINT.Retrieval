influence of variable flow of positive solar particles on
    the wind in the ionosphere qualitative results of a calculation
    of the interaction of electrodynamic and hydrodynamic forces in
    the ionosphere at a height where the two forces are of the same
    order of magnitude indicate a distribution of wind velocity and
    direction similar to that observed by hoffmeister and shown in
    shows the variation of the and components and of the resultant
    of the wind velocity over a day period
