excitation of plasma oscillations and growing plasma
    waves report of preliminary results of a new experiment in
    which the beam is modulated by a microwave signal before it
    interacts with the plasma a very strong interaction is observed
    which shows essentially the theoretically predicted form of
    behaviour
