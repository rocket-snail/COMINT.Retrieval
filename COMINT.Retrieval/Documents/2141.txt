a theoretical investigation of the ionospheric electron
    density variation during a solar eclipse the investigation
    reported previously by is extended to the general case of where
    is the apparent diameter of the moon and that of the sun a
    uniform distribution of radiation over the solar disk is
    assumed convenient formulae are derived for the minimum
    electron density and for the time of occurrence of the minimum
    for a partial eclipse of magnitude an approximate expression is
    derived giving minimum electron density as a function of with
    an error of the average ionospheric sounding equipment
