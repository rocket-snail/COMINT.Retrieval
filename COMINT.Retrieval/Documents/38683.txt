paramagnetic centres as detectors of ultrasonic radiation
    at microwave frequencies it may be possible to detect microwave
    phonons generated by an electromechanical or magnetomechanical
    transducer by observing their effect on the saturation of an
    electron spin resonance line the quantitative aspects of this
    are estimated
