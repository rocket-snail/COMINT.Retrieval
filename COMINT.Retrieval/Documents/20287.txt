optimum noise and gain bandwidth performance for a
    practical one port parametric amplifier analysis shows that the
    conditions necessary for minimum noise temperature are
    compatible with those necessary for maximum gain bandwidth
    product if the diode has a high self resonance frequency there
    is a characteristic figure of merit for the diode and an
    optimum pump frequency a series of design curves is
    given
