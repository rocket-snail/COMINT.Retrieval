determination of the earths gravitational potential from
    satellite orbits from the motions of the orbital planes of four
    satellites values for the second fourth and sixth harmonics in
    the earths gravitational potentials have been obtained
    allowance is made for atmospheric lunar and solar perturbations
    and the results are compared with those of other authors
