mass spectrometer measurements of the ionic composition
    of the atmosphere by the third artificial earth satellite
    discussion of results obtained from an analysis of mass
    spectrograms taken between the may at heights of km in the
    latitude interval graphs show the variations of relative ionic
    intensity as a function of height and latitude above km
    molecular ions are on longer observed
