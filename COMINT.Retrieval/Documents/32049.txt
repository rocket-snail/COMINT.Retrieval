world maps of f layer critical frequencies for the
    solstice and equinox months of and hourly world maps of are
    analysed as a function of solar activity results show
    asymmetrical distribution over the two hemispheres
    discontinuous diurnal movement of world maximum ionization and
    the existence of four poles in the distribution of the mean
    diurnal rate of increase of ionization due to solar activity
    two of these poles corresponding to the magnetic poles and the
    other two being located in the equatorial belt where the
    geomagnetic equator is further from the geographic equator it
    is concluded that these phenomena cannot be explained by
    existing theories and that the possibility of corpuscular
    discharge from a van allen belt should be investigated
    particularly in relation to equatorial regions
