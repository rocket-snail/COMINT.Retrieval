air drag effect on a satellite orbit described by
    difference equations in the revolution number difference
    equations are derived whose solutions express changes in
    orbital size and shape and give the satellites time behaviour
    as functions of the revolution number the results are obtained
    from a first order perturbation theory using a small air drag
    parameter and assuming the air density function to be locally
