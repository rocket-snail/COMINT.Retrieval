we must present the full breadth of the swedish book
    market. interviews jan gumpert, director of the swedish library
    service, who discusses the impact of cuts on the libraries.
    local authorities are finding their cultural budgets, with
    libraries as the largest item, easy targets. attempts are made
    to save the book budget as far as possible and cuts are made
    instead in opening hours and activities. vacancies are likely
    to be frozen. for the library service the cuts mean that the
    stock of older titles will have to be reduced, but there are no
    plans to cut the number of titles offered. export of library
    furniture to the arab world alleviates somewhat the lack of
    markets in sweden. the service's computer system, bums, is now
    installed in 34 local authorities. there is close cooperation
    with the research libraries' automation system libris.
    discusses the impact of the literature commission and the
    possible effects of the public libraries commission.
