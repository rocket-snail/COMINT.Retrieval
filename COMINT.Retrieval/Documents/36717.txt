a study of the ionospheric irregularities which cause
    spread f echoes and scintillations of radio stars a discussion
    of the correlation between the occurrence of spread f echoes at
    slough inverness and oslo the irregularities responsible for
    the spreading occur in bands which lie along parallels of
    latitude and have a width of the order of km it is suggested
    that the irregularities occur at heights near km
