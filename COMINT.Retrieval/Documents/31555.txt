on the complexities of asking questions. difficulties in
    interpretation of library surveys. in an investigation into how
    people differ in their understanding of questions in
    library-user surveys, a relatively homogeneous group (students
    on a methodology course and their acquaintances) was asked to
    complete a 2-part questionnaire. part 1 described situations
    that often occur in a library and types of contact with reading
    material and asked respondents whether they would call each
    'library use'. part 2 described the frequency of situations and
    asked for an appropriate adverb, such as 'seldom' or 'often'.
    the responses showed a surprising variation, an indication that
    the questionnaire procedure could result in serious distortion
    if used in a quantitative investigation.
