the utilization of agrindex in the caribbean. a survey
    was carried out to investigate the information habits and needs
    of the agricultural researches in the english-speaking
    countries of the caribbean region with particular emphasis on
    the use of agrindex. the survey revealed that agrindex is used
    by and known to only a small number of researchers and possible
    reasons for this are discussed. from all indications it seems
    that there is a need for an information service which would
    provide abstracts and reviews of regional agricultural
    literature as well as information on research in progress. two
    recommendations are made; one for the development of a user
    education programme which would ensure wider use of agrindex
    and the second for a sub-regional co-ordination centre to
    provide these services.
