carry out a reading campaign in your class. a reading
    campaign was carried out in class 3b of islev school in
    rodovre, denmark, in which the pupils aimed to read at home a
    total of 200 books from the school library in 9 weeks. the
    readers were given a time in which to read each book and used a
    form to report on the content, illustrations and ease of
    reading. these comments were read to the class each week. the
    1st batch of books was chosen by the 2 teachers concerned, the
    next by teachers and pupils together in the library, and the
    last mainly by the pupils themselves. if no book attracted a
    child, he or she could chose 1 from the library with help from
    the librarian. a 'book thermometer' in the classroom showed
    progress in reading the 200 books. an exhibition on the project
    was mounted in the library and a tape was made of some of the
    readers' opinions. the campaign stimulated interest in reading
    and in borrowing books from the school library and some
    children who had never read a book before now did so, sometimes
    as a result of the recorded comments. the aim was fulfilled,
    all 200 books being read during the 9-week period.
