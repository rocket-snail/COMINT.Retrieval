diffraction of electromagnetic waves by a half plane the
    observed intensity and phase values of the field near the edge
    of a thin high conductivity sheet are compared with sommerfelds
    rigorous solution for an infinitely thin perfectly conducting
    half plane good agreement being obtained results for sheets of
    different thicknesses and conductivities show the importance of
    these factors in determining the field near the diffracting
    edge
