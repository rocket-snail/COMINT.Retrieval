preliminary data on solar extreme ultraviolet radiation
    in the upper atmosphere a rocket borne monochromator was flown
    in august the intensity of the solar spectrum from was scanned
    in sec at a series of heights up to km tables of the
    intensities extrapolated to a height above the earths
    atmosphere are given together with absorption cross sections
    and t other useful information for completeness similar tables
    are given for wavelengths outside the range covered by the
    august measurements
