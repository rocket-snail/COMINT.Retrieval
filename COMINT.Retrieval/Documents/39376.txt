educating the library user: an experiment at deal and
    dover libraries. describes 2 courses, organised separately, at
    dover and deal public libraries designed to educate members of
    the public in library use. the dover course took the form of a
    2 1/2 hour 'library workshop', which undertook to introduce
    members to various aspects of the library in one evening
    session. the deal version was more specialised in content and
    involved 6 2-hour sessions (later extended to 7). attempts to
    evaluate the courses in terms of approach, content and overall
    success.
