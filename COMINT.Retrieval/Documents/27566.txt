effective geomagnetic equator for cosmic radiation the
    distribution of the geomagnetic field extending far from the
    surface of the earth is investigated by using cosmic ray
    particles as probes measurements using the neutron intensity
    from the nucleonic component indicate wide discrepancies
    between the observations and geomagnetic coordinates derived
    from surface magnetic field measurements some anomalous
    observations of cosmic rays can be explained as due to the
    interaction of the rotating and inclined magnetic dipole field
    with a highly ionized interplanetary medium
