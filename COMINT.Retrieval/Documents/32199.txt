transistor circuits based on the half supply voltage
    principle analysis shows that temperature stabilization of a
    transistor can be effected by a preceding dc coupled amplifying
    stage stabilized on the half supply voltage principle practical
    circuits are described for af amplifiers and stabilized supply
