experimental characteristics of a microwave parametric
    amplifier using a semiconductor diode a rectangular cavity
    simultaneously resonant at and is used with a ge junction diode
    having a zero bias capacitance of and a spreading resistance of
    with a pumping signal applied at amplification can be obtained
    at either of the lower frequencies at gain preliminary
    measurements show a noise figure less than db
