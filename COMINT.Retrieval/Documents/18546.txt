vector potential derivation from scalar potentials digest
    of paper presented at aiee district meeting may definitions are
    given of vector potential it is shown that vector potentials
    can be derived from the scalar potentials included in the
    tables of greens functions below results are given for the
    field due to a thin rectangular sheet of magnetic material or a
    rectangular coil
