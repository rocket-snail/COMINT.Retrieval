the second fundamental theorem of electrical networks an
    independent proof is given of a theorem which states for the
    norton nodal representation the relations previously proved by
    ingram and cramlet of for the thevenin mesh representation the
    nodal equations of kron as given by le corbeiller of are
    deduced by a method similar to that of synge the relation
    between the nodal and mesh theorems is discussed
