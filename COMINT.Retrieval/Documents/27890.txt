practical applications of personnel management in
    children's services. prepared from the author's notes for a
    talk at the ontario library association conference, oct 80.
    identifies some aspects of personnel management which are
    special to children's public library service. it is essential
    to be able to successfully maintain the middle management role,
    being familiar with top management's expectations despite the
    traditional physical and functional isolation of the children's
    department. smooth running of the department is particularly
    important as the clients' emotional demands on staff are so
    great. the children's librarian must establish his place in the
    library's middle management team and tactfully ensure that his
    department, too, has a full complement of
    professionally-qualified staff.
