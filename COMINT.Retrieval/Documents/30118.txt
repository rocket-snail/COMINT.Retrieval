librarians and their work among readers. there are 346
    public libraries in the turgovishche region. (north-east
    bulgaria) with collections of more than 1 1/2 million volumes,
    i.e. about 9 books per head of the population. each reader
    borrows, on average, almost 13 books every year. 1/3 of the
    171,000 inhabitants in the area are turks catered for by 47
    librarians. after literacy courses and reading aloud in the
    early post-war years, the librarians' efforts can now be geared
    to attracting readers from every family. libraries are helped
    by clubs of young friends of books as well as by other
    organisations. discussions on significant works of literature
    and other events are arranged by the libraries to encourage the
    turkish population to attain a higher standard of living and to
    take pride in their socialist homeland. results of the
    concerted efforts can be demonstrated most tangibly in the
    changed life of turkish women. veiled in the recent past, they
    work now, not only in agriculture, bu t in many other fields.
    they also sing in mixed choirs and appear on the stage.
    however, as the knowledge of the bulgarian language has become
    more widespread among the turks in bulgaria, the reading of
    books in turkish has followed a progressive downward
    trend.
