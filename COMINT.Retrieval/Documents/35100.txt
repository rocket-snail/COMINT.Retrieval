antenna and receiver measurements by solar and cosmic
    noise the sun and various intense cosmic sources of rf
    radiation which have been previously measured are used as
    calibration sources for determining aerial patterns and
    receiver sensitivities for radio astronomy investigations
    practical procedure is outlined inaccuracies are involved in
    evaluating background radiation contours and solar energy
    distribution but the technique is sufficiently accurate for
    checking field instruments
