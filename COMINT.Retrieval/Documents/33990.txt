libraries after the xvi communist party congress.
    prospects and further development of the major library networks
    in slovakia are briefly outlined for the next 5 years. although
    the past decade proved to be the most successful period in
    public libraries, a new scheme for a public library network is
    envisaged including several district cultural centres as well
    as the necessary structural changes. in-service courses for
    information scientists must be offered on a larger scale than
    before and the cooperation of scientific libraries with their
    counterparts in socialist countries should be strengthened.
    young people should be helped by school libraries which ought
    to be fully integrated into the whole educational process
    starting at primary schools. manual workers, labourers and
    young apprentices can be attracted to trade union libraries by
    a great variety of library games, quizes and competitions.
    information workers are encouraged to play a more active role
    in the comecon information system a s well as contributing to
    the international dinform.
