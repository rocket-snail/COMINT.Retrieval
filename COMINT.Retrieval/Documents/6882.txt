the mechanism of field dependent secondary emission an
    account of experiments made to test the theory that the
    mechanism of field dependent secondary emission is similar to
    that of the townsend avalanche in gas discharges special tubes
    were used having dynodes with a porous coating the results
    indicate tht the high yield of secondaries is independent of
    the base material the variation of secondary current with field
    strength was in accordance with the gas discharge equations
    this was confirmed by retarding field measurements of the
    energies and mean free paths of the secondaries the time
    required for the surface to become charged was determined by
    using pulsed bombarding currents and was found to be consistent
    with the theory
