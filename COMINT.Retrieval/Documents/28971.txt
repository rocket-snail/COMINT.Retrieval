the electrical conductivity of the ionosphere and
    disturbances of the geomagnetic field at audio and lower
    frequencies on the basis of assumed values for collision
    frequency and maximum electron density for the and layers
    values are calculated for the conductivity parallel and
    perpendicular to the magnetic field and for periods
    corresponding to certain critical frequencies the significance
    of the results is discussed in relation to the possibility of
    extraterrestrial origins for geomagnetic field
    disturbances
