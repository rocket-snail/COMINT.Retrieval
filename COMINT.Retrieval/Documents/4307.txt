some problems with part-time courses in librarianship. in
    addition to fulltime courses offered by the school of
    librarianship in sofia, part-time courses, i.e. in-service
    courses, help to increase the number of qualified librarians.
    from 1960 to 1976, 936 part-time students enrolled, and 834,
    i.e. 89%, completed their studies including 16 students from
    the cyril and methodius national library. 99% of the students
    were women, who were forced frequently to extend their studies
    beyond 3 years because of maternity leave, illness and other
    reasons. in future, the central libraries, in particular, must
    help to select suitable candidates as prospective part-time
    students. libraries also have a duty to intensify their
    assistance to enrolled part-time students, provide help during
    the course as well as to assist those students who are
    preparing for final examinations and theses. only then can
    part-time courses gradually become an equivalent to fulltime
    study.
