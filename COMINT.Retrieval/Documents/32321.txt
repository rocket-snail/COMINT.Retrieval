refraction of extraterrestrial radio waves in the
    ionosphere expressions are derived for estimating ionospheric
    refraction at low frequencies horizontal gradients of electron
    density are considered positions of a discrete source obtained
    from observation at after applying corrections for refraction
    are within a few minutes of arc of the observed position at
