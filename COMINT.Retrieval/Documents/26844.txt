matrix representation of transistor circuits transistor
    circuits are discussed in terms of measurable quantities only
    once the admittance matrix of the grounded base transistor has
    been determined the matrices of the grounded emitter and
    grounded collector transistors can easily be derived matrix
    representation also provides a direct method for analysis of
    stages in cascade
