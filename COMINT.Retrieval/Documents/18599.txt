legal aspects of public lending right. contribution to a
    thematic issue on public lending right (plr). most plr
    proponents content that plr legislation is an integral part of
    copyright law, but in only 1 of the 10 countries to enact plr
    legislation has the statute been made a part of copyright law.
    the plr concept does not fit neatly into the principles of us
    copyright law, but the successful development of 2droit de
    suite1 legislation (requiring payment of royalties to artists
    for resale of their works) in california is an indication that
    plr is a workable concept in the us legal structure.
