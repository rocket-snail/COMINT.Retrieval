fluctuations in self oscillating systems of thomson type
    amplitude and phase fluctuations in weakly nonlinear
    selfoscillating systems are considered using a symbolic
    differential equation describing the fluctuations of the random
    functions and the methods of the correlation theory a system
    with one degree of freedom is considered first and the general
    theory is applied to the case of a valve generator operating in
    the soft state the theory is then applied to passive systems
    with one and two degrees of freedom the effect of stabilizing
    the frequency of an oscillator by means of a high circuit is
    discussed the method of taking into account thermal
    fluctuations shown
