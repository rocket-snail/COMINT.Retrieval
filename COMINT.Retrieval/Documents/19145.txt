ionospheric drifts determined from radio star
    scintillation observations spaced receiver observations have
    been made at halley bay and ionospheric velocities deduced from
    the motion of the diffraction pattern over the ground both the
    time of midnight reversal and the drift speed correlate well
    with evans measurements of motions of auroral forms
