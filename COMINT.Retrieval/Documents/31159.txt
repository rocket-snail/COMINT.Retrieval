investigation of search codes (matchcoding) for catalogue
    data. during the planning for the incorporation of data
    processing in libraries, the decision-making process is aided
    through the use of basic data. presents an evaluation of about
    442,000 machine-readable catalogue entries from the university
    of konstanz library. the effectiveness and behaviour of various
    search codes (matchcodes) determined by different data
    categories were analysed concerning their performance within an
    expanding data base and in juxtaposition with one another.
    furthermore, the frequency of identical data and their length
    was noted. results showed that clear distinctions can be
    attained if types of search codes are assigned to specific data
    groups; stop list support is, however, necessary for dynamic
    matchcodes.
