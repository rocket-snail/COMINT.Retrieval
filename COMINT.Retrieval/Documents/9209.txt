high frequency compensation of rc amplifiers a discussion
    with special reference to transient response optimum values are
    tabulated for the circuit parameters for some typical circuits
    and compensating arrangements in a multistage amplifier simply
    compensated by means of a coil in the anode leads the rise time
    can be reduced to of the uncompensated value if the time
    constants of the stages are equal and to if the time constants
    are staggered
