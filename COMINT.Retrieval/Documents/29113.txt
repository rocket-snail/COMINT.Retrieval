temperature rise of solid junctions under pulse load the
    magnitude and duration of current pulses are correlated with
    temperature rise in the junction use of successive
    approximations assuming that various parts of a body are not
    yet subjected to a temperature increase or have already reached
    a temperature differential corresponding to the steady state
    reduces the problem to a simple case of heat diffusion
