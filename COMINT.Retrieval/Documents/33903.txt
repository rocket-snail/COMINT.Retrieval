isolating direct current amplifiers a circuit providing
    an output direct current or voltage proportional to an input
    direct voltage and having no common point between input and
    output uses fixed frequency crystal controlled oscillator in
    conjunction with a discriminator whose phase is varied by means
    of an electromechanical modulator which converts the input
    signal into a capacitance variation several applications are
    mentioned
