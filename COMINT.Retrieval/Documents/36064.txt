the educational potential of integrated information
    systems when combined with educational technology-some
    implications for technology transfer. some potentialities for
    the use of advanced integrated information/learning systems in
    the study of the inter-related role of hitherto relatively
    intractable complex variables such as cognitive mapping
    behaviours, learning styles, and the media preferences of
    instructors and students, are described, with special reference
    to the possible implications of such research explorations in
    the technology transfer process between technologically
    advanced and less advanced nations.
