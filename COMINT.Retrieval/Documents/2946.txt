surface resistors for centimetre wave technique an
    account is given of the development of a method of
    manufacturing carbon layer resistors for waveguide attenuators
    and nonreflecting terminations using a colloidal suspension of
    graphite and an insulating base of pertinax consideration is
    given to the choice of medium water or alcohol and the method
    of application painting dipping or spraying particular
    importance is attached to the uniformity of the layers the
    resistance layer is protected by a coating of polystyrene an
    instrument designed for measuring the dc resistance of the
    layers is described measurements at dc and at are
    reported
