citation and co-citation indicators of a phased impact of
    the bcs theory in the physics of superconductivity. an
    intellectual account of the physics of superconductivity was
    compared with citation and cocitation data during 2 historical
    periods that coincided with the introduction of its central
    explanatory theory (bcs). investigates the cocitation data
    through factor analysis. results give preliminary support to a
    hypothesis that distinguishes impact phrases in the effect of
    the theory on the cognitive organisation of the speciality. it
    is also observed that citation and cocitation data are separate
    types of information which, under some historical conditions,
    give differing results.
