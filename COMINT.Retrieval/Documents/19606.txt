a maximum of temperature in the middle ionosphere a
    method is outlined for determining variations in scale height h
    and electron density with height from profiles and from
    calculations of the electron loss results obtained from
    observations at puerto rico show that h has a maximum value at
    a height of about km with considerable daily and yearly
    variations
