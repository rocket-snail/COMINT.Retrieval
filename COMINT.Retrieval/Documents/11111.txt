daytime enhancement of size of sudden commencements and
    initial phase of magnetic storms at huancayo statistical
    analysis of data for the period shows that the frequency of
    occurrence of is independent of the time of day but that the
    average size of and of initial phases of magnetic storms is
    greater during daylight hours the size is also found to vary
