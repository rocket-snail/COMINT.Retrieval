a planned decentralized solution for national document
    supply' the federal republic of germany. edited version of
    paper presented at the international seminar on national
    document provision, boston spa, 22-24 sept 80. supraregional
    document supply is decentralised in west germany because the
    political framework is federal. coordination of acquisitions is
    achieved by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft, which
    organises and largely funds a cooperative programme based on
    special subject libraries (sondersammelgebietsbibliotheken).
    the 7 regional union catalogues have been supplemented by
    central subject catalogues, the berlin periodicals data base,
    and other union cataloguing projects. interlending is based on
    the 7 regions, but direct requesting to the special subject
    libraries has increased significantly in the search for faster
    supply times.
