ionospheric height measurement by the method of delayed
    coincidence an outline description with block diagram is given
    of equipment in use at an indian station for regular
    observation of lunar tides in the upper atmosphere the
    apparatus can be readily adapted for automatic recording of
    curves the method is basically as described previously but the
    technique has been improved giving an accuracy within good
    results are obtained even in the presence of heavy
    atmospherics
