job permanency: the academic librarian's dilemma is the
    administrator's challenge for the 1980s. the academic library
    is becoming a no-movement, stable faculty with everyone afraid,
    financially unable, or professionally incapable of moving. the
    library manager could stop the faculty dying and help staff to
    develop professionally by providing contract options, changing
    staffing patterns, rotating personnel, offering leave of
    absence, and improving the work environment.
