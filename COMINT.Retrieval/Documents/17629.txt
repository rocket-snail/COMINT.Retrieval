the insertion characteristics of cascaded circuits a
    method of dealing with series connected filter circuits in
    particular those consisting of electromechanical elements is
    considered a single quaripole is derived to represent cac
    cascade connected equal and symmetrical quadripoles and
    different types of end section are added to this equivalent
    quadripole the impedance matrix of the equivalent network is
    determined the application of the principle to a combination of
    unequal quadripoles is outlined
