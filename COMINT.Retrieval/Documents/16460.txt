resonance circuits comprising or elements and some
    applications the frequency characteristics of the wien bridge
    and of an analogous inductance bridge are investigated
    theoretically pseudo resonance phenomena occurring in the
    neighbourhood of bridge balance are discussed true resonance is
    obtained when the bridge is associated with a feedback circuit
    to act as an oscillator the tuned amplifier and the and
    oscillators are described
