libraries and science. the main concern of libraries and
    information centres should be speedy and effective service to
    users. they must be concerned to eliminate any unnecessary
    delays, which may cause delays in the scientist's work.
    librarians should take an active interest in the work of their
    users and their education and professional expertise should
    allow them to do so. a survey in the slovak academy of science
    had shown that most sought after are information sources 1-3
    years old in natural sciences and medicine, 1-10 years old in
    the social sciences. good acquisition policy, quality in
    bibliographical and information services contribute to further
    development and scientific and technological revolution.
