the excitation of molecular vibration and rotation by
    impact of slow electrons a new approximate formula is derived
    for the cross sections for excitation of molecular vibration
    and rotation by impact of slow electrons account is taken of
    the fact that in such impacts the incident electron is moving
    much faster than the nuclei in the molecule while its wave
    function suffers considerable distortion by the molecular
    field
