three level maser action in gas theory of multiple
    quantum transition and doppler effect in three level gas maser
    discussion of the multiple quantum process for the off
    resonance condition the intensity of the emission produced is
    calculated using perturbation theory as well as the more
    general javans theory the doppler effect is analysed from
    semiclassical and quantum mechanical viewpoints
