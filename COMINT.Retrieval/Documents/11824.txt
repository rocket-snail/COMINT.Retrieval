cultural activities in public libraries. a practical
    discussion based on published material, conversation with
    librarians, and library visits. considers the importance of
    cultural activities for developing social and cultural values,
    and the methods and techniques available; the objectives in
    relation to conventional public library activities; planning
    procedures, with a full guide for implementing a programme; the
    human, material, economic and institutional resources required;
    evaluation techniques, to be modified as circumstances dictate;
    and programmes for adults, children, and young people, giving a
    wide range of suggested activities for each group. finally
    examines the reasons why latin america has largely failed to
    develop programmes in this field, and gives example of projects
    successfully initiated in colombia at 3 libraries, including
    the national library.
