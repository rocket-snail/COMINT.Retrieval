heinsius, kayser and eighteenth century bibliography. no
    historical national bibliography for german literature exists;
    instead great importance is placed on the bibliographical works
    compiled by heinsius and kayser in the 18th century. these are
    widely used as reference bibliographies and the validity of
    their entries is rarely questioned. heinsius and kayser based
    their catalogues on bibliographies published by the book trade
    such as exhibition catalogues. these were often incomplete and
    did not include reprints or new editions. there are many
    examples of incorrect references in the catalogues and a
    complete study of the works of heinsius and kayser is necessary
    to determine what is reliable reference material and what is
    not. a guide to using the catalogues which listed the changing
    relationships in the book trade noting which publisher was
    taken over, by whom and when would also be invaluable in the
    work of following up bibliographical references.
