visual aspects of the electronic office. some of the
    visual tasks involved in using a vdt differ in kind from those
    encountered in a traditional office. the self-luminous nature
    of the screen characters and the 3 task areas of source
    material, keyboard and screen present a challenge to the
    lighting designer and ergonomist. suitable combinations of
    light source and luminaire and the relative locations of all
    the elements involved can provide acceptable solutions but due
    recognition should be paid to the ophthalmic requirements of
    operators.
