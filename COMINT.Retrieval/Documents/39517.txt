some aspects of technical report processing by federal
    agencies. technical reports are a valuable resource of
    scientific and technical information which has been allowed to
    slip into less than maximum utility. while the processing of
    more traditional information sources has progressed and
    remarkably improved through such mechanisms as shared
    cataloguing and on-line access to huge files of cataloguing
    data, the corresponding processing of technical reports has
    remained relatively stagnant. some efforts at coordinating the
    processing of reports have been made by the 4 us federal
    agencies responsible for the largest report collections.
    additional efforts suggested include study of a common report
    format, more extensive shared processing of federal documents
    and increased efforts towards cooperation in the federal
    library network.
