design of low pass amplifiers for fast transients the
    proposed synthesis of an interstage coupling network for wide
    band low pass amplifiers is based on darlingtons design method
    of some practical details are given of a amplifier
    experimentally determined phase and amplitude characteristics
    are presented graphically oscillograms of the transient
    response are shown details are also given of the design of a
    phase correction network
