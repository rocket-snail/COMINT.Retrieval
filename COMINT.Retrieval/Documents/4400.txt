waves in a plasma in a magnetic field an analysis of the
    small amplitude oscillations of a fully ionized quasi neutral
    plasma in a uniform externally produced magnetic field no self
    excitation of waves around thermal equilibrium is predicted in
    contrast to the results of gordeyev for longitudinal electron
    oscillations propagated perpendicularly to the constant
    magnetic field there are gaps in the spectrum of allowed
    frequencies at multiples of the electron gyration frequency but
    zero landau damping when the ion dynamics are included two
    classes of low frequency oscillations are found and the results
    for the propagation of em waves in an ionized atmosphere are
    also derived
