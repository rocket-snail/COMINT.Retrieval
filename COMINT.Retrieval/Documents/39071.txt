new experimental evidence of the effect of magnetic
    storms on the magnetosphere new methods of whistler analysis of
    have been used to study the effect of magnetic storms on the
    time delay at whistler nose frequencies during the late phases
    of magnetic storms these time delays are reduced there is
    evidence that these changes in delay represent changes in the
    electron density in the magnetosphere
