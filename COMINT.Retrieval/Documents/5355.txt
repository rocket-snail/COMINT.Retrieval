online periodicals at hull college of higher education.
    describes the operation, within the college's multi-site
    library, of an on-line periodicals control system, developed
    completely in-house, which replaced an inefficient manual
    system. each subscription record holds details of title,
    alternative title, location code and subject code and is
    composed of fixed-length fields with a-character alphanumeric
    control number. fields include frequency, issues per volume and
    price, and each entry may be termed 'alive' or 'inactive'.
    library records were then converted to machine-readable form
    and may now be sorted by location, type and subject/department.
    the simple accessioning procedures are detailed. the system
    which went live in jan 81 is proving very efficient in this
    particular college situation.
