on the handling of depository copies. on 5 dec 78 the
    german library (deutsche bibliothek) held a colloquium
    concerning the supply of depository copies of material to
    libraries in west germany. the laws governing depository copies
    were criticised as being too varied and inexact, demands were
    made for stricter laws to cover all types of material of value
    as depository copies. more library posts for staff dealing
    specifically with this aspect of library work should be
    created. most libraries concentrate on collecting conventional
    forms of publications and tend to neglect innovations such as
    microforms.
