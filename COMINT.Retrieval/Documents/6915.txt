the development and testing of a conceptual model of
    public library user behavior. the objective of the study was to
    test the following hierarchical model' public library use is a
    function of (1) individual characteristics; (2) awareness of
    library services; (3) perceived accessibility of the library;
    (4) perceived ease of use of the library; and (5) use of other
    non-public libraries. the model was tested with 4 different
    library use measures-a dichotomised measure of use and nonuse,
    and, among library users, frequency of use and 2-factor
    analytically derived indexes descriptive of 2 distinctly
    different types of library use. type 1 use appeared to measure
    use intensity; type 2-in-house use. interview data were
    collected from 202 residents of syracuse, new york. results
    indicated that public library users perceived the library as
    more accessible than did nonusers, and use frequency was
    related to awareness of special library programmes, as was
    intensity of use, and in-house use was related to use of other
    libraries.
