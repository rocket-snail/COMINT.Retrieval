build up phenomena in minimum phase networks wheelers
    paired echo method is used to evaluate the network response to
    a single pulse and to a step voltage the method is
    fundamentally a simplified application of the fourier integral
    and is particularly useful for evaluating the distortion with a
    minimum of computation
