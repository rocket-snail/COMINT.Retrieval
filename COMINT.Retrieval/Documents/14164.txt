the heights of ionospheric winds as measured at long
    radio wavelengths the winds region is considered as
    constituting a screen capable of altering the phase and
    amplitude of a radio wave passing through it the field pattern
    at the ground is assumed to be such that information on the
    phase change and absorption experienced by a wave passing
    through the screen can be obtained from it it is also assumed
    that only the ordinary wave is observed and that the region
    concerned is of the wkb type with these assumptions theory is
    is developed which when applied to experimental data for
    signals gives the winds region height as km during the day and
    km at night
