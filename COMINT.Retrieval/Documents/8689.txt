theory of stochastic linear systems with gaussian
    parameter variations a theory of linear systems with randomly
    varying parameters id is developed under the assumption that
    the parameter processes are gaussian processes obtained by
    linear filtering of white noise a theory of mean and mean
    square stability is given and applied to an circuit with
    randomly varying capacitance an error in a previous analysis is
    corrected
