formulae for calculating filter circuits with flattened
    attenuation curves simple formulae are given for calculating
    tchebycheff type low pass filters with attenuation values
    falling between prescribed limits either inside or outside the
    pass band attenuation curves obtainable with filters thus
    calculated are shown
