geomagnetic distortion of region e an analysis of the
    behaviour of the normal e region suggests that departures from
    the classical chapman theory can be attributed to vertical
    drift of ionization resulting from the interaction of the
    geomagnetic field and the sq current system flowing in or near
    the e region perturbations of under magnetically disturbed
    conditions and near the auroral zone are also discussed
