a comparison of sferics as observed in the very low
    frequency and extremely low frequency bands the component is
    almost always followed by a component of extremely low
    frequency but about one third of these components are not
    preceded by components positive polarity wave forms predominant
    during daytime and their median amplitudes always exceed those
    of the negative polarity waveforms which predominate at
    night
