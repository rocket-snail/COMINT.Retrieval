the gas filled triode as pulse amplifier valve an
    experimental investigation is reported using a special circuit
    to avoid permanent ignition a recovery time of can be attained
    with a he filled type valve for applied pulses of duration the
    operating threshold value of input voltage may be as low as for
    shorter pulses the threshold is a few volts as pulse width and
    height decreases the build up time for the discharge increases
    and the time delay of the amplified pulse is increased the gas
    triode is thus only appropriat in the output stage of a pulse
    amplifier
