    iv. security-storage and control, organisation and management,
    networks and external sources of information. the last of 4
    separately published volumes describing the basic documentation
    practices involved in the initial setting up and operation of
    an information-library organisation to provide
    defense-aerospace information services. the focus is on a
    practical, rather than theoretical, approach for both the
    senior person setting up a new system as well as junior staff
    who may be using the manual as a training aid. this volume
    consists of 3 main sections. the 1st is concerned with basis
    problems in the security control and storage of classified and
    other sensitive documents. the 2nd section gives a general
    background to organisational factors involved in establishing
    an information centre. in the final section the basic aspects
    of the telecommunications and networking are reviewed and
    information given on the availability and use of on-line data
    bases in the usa and europe.
