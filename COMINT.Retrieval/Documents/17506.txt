effect of secondary electrons on initiation of discharges
    initiation of discharges between parallel electrodes in inert
    gases was investigated at pressures of using a frequency of and
    magnetic fields up to two effects due to a transverse magnetic
    field were observed decrease of breakdown potential and
    suppression of a glow discharge the former is due to the
    cyclotron effect the maximum reduction of occurred at a field
    strength where is the frequency of the electric field the
    latter is shown to be due to prevention of the secondary
    electron resonance effect observed in a longitudinal magnetic
    field and noted by in his work on the secondary electron
