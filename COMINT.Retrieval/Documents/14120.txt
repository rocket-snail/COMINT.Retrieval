physical parameters of the atmospheric escape layer the
    height of the atmospheric escape layer is approximately in the
    daytime dropping to at night the temperature of the layer is
    too low to cause the dissipation of helium from the atmosphere
    ad it is suggested that this process occurs during solar
    disturbances
