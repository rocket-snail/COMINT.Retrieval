the electromagnetic interaction between two crossing
    electron streams parts one and two the interaction between two
    infinitely extended velocity modulated streams has been studied
    in part one where beam velocities common to microwave valves
    are considered the lorentz term in the equation of motion has
    been omitted it is introduced in part two for higher beam
    velocities the distribution of ions formed by attachment of
    electrons moving in a steady state of motion through a gas the
    distribution of ions formed by attachment of electrons
    diffusing through a gas is solved exactly and the results are
    compared with an approximate calculation given earlier by
