diffraction of centimetre waves by a conducting sphere in
    a waveguide measurements were made at a frequency of using a
    hybrid arrangement results indicate that reflection coefficient
    is proportional to sphere volume dispersion of results is
    attributed to small geometrical irregularities the work is
    preliminary to a study of the diffraction of waves by
    clouds
