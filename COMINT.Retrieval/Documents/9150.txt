centres for acquisition and dissemination of scientific
    and technical information' the french ministry of universities
    information policy. as part of the projected french national
    information system, the 1st stage of the cadist plan was
    implemented in jan 81, when 10 universities took responsibility
    for the collection and dissemination of information in 11
    designated fields. eventually 20 universities will cover a
    total of 30 subject areas, obtaining the most complete
    information and simplifying access to primary sources. the
    reasons for choosing this kind of system as opposed to the uk
    or german models, the selection of centres and their mandate,
    and their rights and duties as officially prescribed, are
    discussed.
