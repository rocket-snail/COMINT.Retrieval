the book and its mirror: advertising for books. extract
    from a study prepared during 1979-80 for the french ecole
    nationale superieure de bibliothecaires. surveys the various
    ways french publishers try to bring new books to the attention
    of potential buyers' publicity launches in bookshops, direct
    mailing, media reviews and advertising, and wall posters.
    newspaper advertisements are the most favoured form; details
    are given of how advertisements are designed, where they are
    placed, and costs. the technical and psychological devices used
    in composing these advertisements are examined in detail, with
    particular reference to layout, the relation between visual and
    verbal elements, and appeal to consumer values. in conclusion,
    some comparison is made between publishers who create publicity
    to promote specific titles, and those who emphasise primarily
    the reputation of the publishing house itself.
