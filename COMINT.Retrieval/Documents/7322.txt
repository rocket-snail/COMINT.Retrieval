criticism of bourgeois librarianship in soviet library
    literature. provides a chronological analysis of the study of
    librarianship in western countries as reflected in the writings
    of soviet librarians. contributions from 1920s and 1930s reveal
    not only criticism of the western library theories but also
    appreciation of practical achievements. inconsistency of theory
    (non-political orientation of libraries) with practice (middle
    class bias of public libraries) was 1 of the main areas of
    criticism in the 1940s and 1950s. 1960s brought wider interest
    in special librarianship and problems encountered in various
    countries. the current interest is the influence of western
    librarianship on developing countries.
