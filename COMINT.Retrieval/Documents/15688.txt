the ionosphere and solar activity the correlation between
    monthly median critical frequencies and solar activity was
    determined for washington d c results were compared with those
    from a similar study made for six arctic stations for noon data
    a greater value at zero sunspot number and a slightly greater
    slope were obtained for washington than for the arctic
    locations the influence of increased solar activity on the
    behaviour of the midnight ionosphere is discussed
