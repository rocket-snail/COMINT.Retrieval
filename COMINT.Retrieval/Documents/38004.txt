theory of coupled endovibrators a system of two cavity
    resonators coupled by means of a narrow slot in their common
    wall is considered theoretically two classes of oscillations
    are considered those whose frequencies are determined primarily
    by the length of the slot and are nearly independent of the
    shape of the resonators those whose frequencies are near the
    frequencies of the oscillations in the resonators when not
    coupled
