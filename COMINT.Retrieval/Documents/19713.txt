a note on the design of conditionally stable feedback
    systems formulae are presented which relate parameters of the
    loop transfer function of a conditionally stable system to the
    relative stability of the system transfer function the
    condition is determined for which the system bandwidth is a
    minimum when the loop transfer function is required to have a
    specified value at a particular frequency
