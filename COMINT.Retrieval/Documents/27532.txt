should hope be abandoned because of the crisis?. the
    implications of the word 'public' must be considered carefully
    in connection with libraries. particular problems are caused in
    selecting fiction and leisure material. readers dislike
    excessive amounts of trivial material as much as the elitist
    approach but the illiteracy of some sections of the public is
    preferable to the total abstinence of the non-reader. the
    public library must bring a new quality to its public service,
    exercising a corrective function in respect of book market
    trends. librarians must mount an offensive action in pursuit of
    the sensible, social and humane aspects of their service. it is
    dangerous to attach too much importance to statistics.
    literature should be provided that crosses all arbitrary
    borders and stimulates the mind.
