observation of the partial solar eclipse february at the
    wavelength of centimeters the diameter of the sun observed at
    this wavelength is greater than that of the visual disk limb

    attributed to a local bright region round sunspots where the
    values of electron density in chromosphere and corona are
    enhanced
