correlation energy of a high density gas plasma
    coordinates the model hamiltonian of sawada which describes
    electron correlation at high density is examined it is shown
    that the set of scattering modes for momentum transfers below a
    certain is not complete it is completed by the plasma mode is
    the natural debye length of the theory
