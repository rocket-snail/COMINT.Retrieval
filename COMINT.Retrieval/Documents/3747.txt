overcoming the retrenchment blues-overriding the 106% tax
    limitation rules in washington state. the '106% rule' is a tax
    limitation tied to the 'millage rate'-expressed in 'cents per
    thousand dollars of associated valuation. for every $1,000 of
    assessed valuation, libraries in washington state collected 50
    cents per year, but now the rate changes annually to ensure
    that the total collected will not exceed 106% of what was
    collected in property tax revenues the year before. taking
    kitsap county, washington, as an example, illustrates what
    library districts can do, and are doing to cope with the rule,
    and the rule's effects on public libraries.
