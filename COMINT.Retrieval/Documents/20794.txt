a view of the future of library networking. future
    developments in library networks will include growth of
    computer-based networks in number and variety of libraries, in
    use of various subsystems, and in size of data bases used.
    services provided by on-line systems will expand to include
    improved subject access, on-line catalogues, serials lists and
    inventory control, acquisitions functions, interlibrary
    lending, circulation, and reference services. additional
    services will include home delivery of information, text
    transmission, home-computing support, library management
    systems, and interface between bibliographic utilities.
    increasing interaction is breaking open the artificial
    compartments in which libraries and librarians have seen
    themselves. the demands placed on library personnel in network
    development will need continued exercise of skill, knowledge,
    and integrity as the collective common sense works for the
    common good.
