ionization and desorption due to strong electric fields
    experimental investigations of the intensity distribution of
    field type electron emission from single crystal points covered
    with thin films of other material are reported where surface
    compounds of with or are present a characteristic change of the
    emission distribution is observed after application of an
    opposing field the change is attributed to local ionization an
    electron being released into the interior of the metal and a
    positive ion being emitted into the vacuum if the field is
    strong enough to overcome the image force the field ionization
    of physically adsorbed molecules or atoms requires relatively
    strong fields quantitative estimates are made of the pull off
    field strength and its temperature variation
