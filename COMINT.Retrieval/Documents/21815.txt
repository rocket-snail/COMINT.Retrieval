effect of circular field on form of longitudinal
    magnetization curve the variation was investigated
    experimentally of the magnetization of an iron tube placed in a
    coaxial magnetic field combined with a circular field produced
    by a current flowing in a conductor placed along the axis of
    the tube the results which are presented graphically are of
    interest in the construction of transformers for amplification
    of weak currents
