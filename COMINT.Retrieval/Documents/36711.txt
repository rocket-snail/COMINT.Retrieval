measuring the effectiveness of shielding materials a
    method developed at the us naval research laboratory is
    described only a small sample of the material under test eg
    wire mesh or conducting coating is needed the sample is
    inserted between two shield cans containing transmitting and
    receiving aerials respectively and the attenuation increase
    produced by the sample is observed the frequency range
    investigated is it may be s possible to extend the method to
    higher frequencies by using waveguide technique
