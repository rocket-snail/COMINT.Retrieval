electron spin resonance absorption in metals part
    experimental measurements were made on li na k be mg al pd and
    w over the temperature range using a cavity resonator technique
    at frequencies of and the dimensions of the specimens were in
    some cases large and in others small compared with skin depth
    the results are compared with those predicted by dysons
    theory
