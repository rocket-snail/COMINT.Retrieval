abiding by the law' legal materials in public libraries.
    increasingly, law materials are needed by an ever-widening
    range of people, and since the source of information most
    readily available to the average person is the public library,
    the library should be the most convenient location for legal
    information. examines the public right of access to information
    with regard to individual legal practice and the attitudes of
    lawyers, and suggests some basic legal texts for a core
    collection. hints are given on the organisation of the
    collection, and the more important bibliographic aids are
    cited.
