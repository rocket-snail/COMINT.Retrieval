large scale movements of the layers moving wavelike
    disturbances with appear to travel with inclined wavefronts
    having both horizontal and vertical motions which are often of
    similar magnitudes and the with varying direction the effects
    are independent of magnetic activity and are probably not
    caused by atmospheric winds a travelling compressional wave is
    suggested as an alternative to motion caused by electric
    fields
