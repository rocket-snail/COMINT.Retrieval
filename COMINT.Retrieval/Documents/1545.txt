    retrieval research and development.i n 1945, vannevar bush
    wrote an article urging scientists to turn to the task of
    making the growing store of knowledge more accessible. (as we
    may think, 2atlantic monthly1 176 (1) 101-108). one device in
    particular which he urged for development was the memex-'a
    machine that should be an extension of the personal memory and
    body of knowledge belonging to an individual, and should work
    in a fashion analogous to the working of the human brain-by
    association rather than by categorical classification'.
    assesses the impact of bush's ideas on the field of information
    retrieval, using both quantitative and qualitative analysis.
    the 1945 article has been widely cited and has been used as a
    symbol for a number of concepts.
