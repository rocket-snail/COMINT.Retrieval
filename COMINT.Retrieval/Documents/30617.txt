scrapbook-a general purpose information handling system.
    the electronic office of the future will require a
    sophisticated information handling framework on which to base
    such facilities as electronic mail, facsimile transmission and
    word processing. scrapbook represents an early stage in the
    development of such a system. it provides facilities for
    information retrieval, electronic mail and word processing, and
    may be readily adapted to incorporate more specialised
    facilities for particular users. the emphasis is on
    flexibility, so that changing user requirements may be met with
    little or no reprogramming effort.
