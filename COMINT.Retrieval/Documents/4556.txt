a guide to reference tools for cataloging africana.
    africana materials are notoriously difficult to catalogue. the
    number of publications about and from africa has increased
    rapidly in the last 2 decades, proportionately increasing the
    number of problem books. although much has been published about
    the problems of cataloguing africana, very little actually aids
    the cataloguer in finding answers to the practical questions
    raised by these materials. answers are found in scattered and
    sometimes obscure publications. there has long been a need for
    a guide to these sources of information. here is such a guide,
    compiled with the needs of both the generalist and specialist
    cataloguer in mind.
