media control report without perspectives. comments on
    2automated media control in the public library, 1a joint report
    by the norwegian association of municipal library workers and
    the computer committee. the working party on pilot projects
    does not delineate long-term perspectives for development,
    making it difficult to see its proposals as part of a whole.
    the swedish situation of 2 separate data systems for special
    and public libraries, resulting in duplication of work and
    under-utilised resources, must be avoided in norway; the report
    is criticised for not considering computer development in
    public and special libraries together. it also fails to specify
    the effects of computerisation on library staffs, borrowers and
    finance. the committee regards issue control as the routine
    most requiring computerisation, but many public libraries have
    other priorities, such as overdue recall work. easily-amassed
    statistics must not be allowed to build up extra work. several
    paragraphs from the report are selected for detailed
    comment.
