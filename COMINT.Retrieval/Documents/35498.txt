vertical extent of auroral arcs and bands measurements on
    photographs taken from three stations indicate that quiet arcs
    and bands are confined to a narrow layer just about the level
    the thickness of this layer is most often between and and
    rarely from the ratio of the number of arcs and bands to the
    total number of observed forms it is inferred that the
    percentage of auroral time during which the luminosity is
    restricted to this layer is
