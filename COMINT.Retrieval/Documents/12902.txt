public relations in university libraries. challenges the
    popularly held belief that the university library has a captive
    audience, and therefore requires little or no public relations
    programme. argues that the use of the academic library by staff
    and students must not be taken for granted, and that detailed
    guidance in the use of the library should be given to
    postgraduates and undergraduates. offers some advice on the
    implementation of a successful public relations programme, and
    suggests the designation of a librarian as a public relations
    officer.
