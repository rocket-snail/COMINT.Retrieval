mapping the information environment of policy-makers'
    some empirical findings from nigeria. a review of the structure
    and functions of nigeria's federal civil service and
    implications for information transfer among public
    policy-makers forms the background for highlighting the
    divergence in the official conceptualisation of information and
    the usual conceptualisation of information by librarians and
    information specialists. suggestions aimed at bridging this gap
    are presented and discussed with a view to integrating access
    to, and use of, hard information in the policy analysis
    environment of civil servants.
