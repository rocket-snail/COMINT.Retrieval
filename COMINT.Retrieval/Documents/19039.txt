periodicals for the disabled' their importance as
    information sources. recent federal legislation mandates
    integration of disabled americans into the mainstream of
    society. thus, there is a need for more information about the
    physically disabled. librarians and other professionals must
    gain an understanding of the perspectives and concerns of
    disabled people, and this is best gained from personal contact.
    where this is not possible, reading of the periodical
    literature published for and by the disabled is recommended.
    these periodicals have changed as the information demands of
    the disabled have evolved, and they offer information not found
    elsewhere. they can educate librarians, rehabilitation workers
    and the public about the needs and abilities of the disabled in
    the usa.
