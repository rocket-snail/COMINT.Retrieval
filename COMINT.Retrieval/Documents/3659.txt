the ion distribution above the f maximum recombination is
    important up to this height the ion distribution is controlled
    by diffusion protons produced by charge exchange between
    hydrogen atoms and oxygen ions move upward along the magnetic
    field lines with an equal number of electrons and produce a
    medium for the propagation of whistlers
