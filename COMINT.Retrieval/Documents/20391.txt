draft of a new library bill' amputated central
    administration and many possibilities of dispensation. this
    draft, issued by the danish ministry of cultural affairs in apr
    81, to become law at the earliest jan 83, operates with a
    complicated central administration, consisting of a chief
    administrator presiding over a research library and a public
    library directorate, each with a library board. some large
    research libraries at present under a different ministry from
    the ministry of culture, will remain outside the central
    control, although general development planning for all research
    libraries is to be centrally administered. there will be no
    direct state financial support for public libraries in general,
    but some specified libraries and activities will receive state
    grants. the joint appropriation is to remain and will include
    the present dispensation fund. dates are set for the
    introduction of full time service and of musical material in
    public libraries.
