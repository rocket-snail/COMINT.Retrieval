functional information design' research and practice.
    although functional objectives have concerned designers for
    many years, and psychologists have published research on issues
    related to graphic design, fruitful cooperation between the 2
    specialisms has only rarely been achieved. suggests that the
    traditional objectives and methods of neither group are
    sufficiently oriented towards the communication of information
    in a complex society. a user-centred approach is urged, drawing
    from both the intuitive problem-solving skills of designers and
    the methodologies of psychologists.
