revenue sharing and state funding in indiana: prospects
    improve for public libraries. in the early 70s the fiscal
    outlook for indiana's public libraries was abysmally
    depressing, with most libraries having no opportunity to
    participate in the distribution of revenue-sharing funds.
    however, as the decade progressed, several legislative bills
    favourable to public libraries were enacted. these followed the
    revenue sharing act of 1972, which permitted government units
    to appropriate funds only for the purposes for which their own
    revenues were expended. in 1978, revenue-sharing funds
    increased dramatically as a result of the state legislators'
    second attempt to provide public libraries with access to
    revenue-sharing funds, with the passage of senate-enrolled act
    no. 208. the optimistic outlook for the 80s is tempered only by
    the concern of librarians about state legislators' commitment
    to continue state funding of public libraries.
