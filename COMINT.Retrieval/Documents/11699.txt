vertical characteristics of travelling ionospheric
    disturbances a comparison between the occurrence of
    disturbances on fixed frequency records and profiles for the
    same period reveals that there appears to be an upper limiting
    height for the occurrence of disturbances on fixed frequency
    and the direction of travel of disturbances is related to
    season only and seems unrelated to height in the
    ionosphere
