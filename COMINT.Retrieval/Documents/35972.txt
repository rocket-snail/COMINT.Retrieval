an investigation of the speed of the solar disturbances
    responsible for type three radio bursts simultaneous
    directional observations at a number of frequencies between
    forty and seventy ms s are described the results support the
    hypothesis that type three bursts are due to plasma
    oscillations excited in the coronal gas
