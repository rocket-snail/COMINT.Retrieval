dielectric properties of ice at very low frequencies and
    the influence of a polarizing field measurements at frequencies
    down to are reported the loss factor passes through a low
    frequency maximum which is distinguishable from that associated
    with the dipole dispersion by its different temperature
    dependence the effect of impurities is to shift the maximum
    towards higher frequencies application of a unidirectional
    field does not affect the permittivity of the pure crystals but
    eliminates the low frequency dispersion when impurities are
    present the observations are consistent with macdonalds
    theory
