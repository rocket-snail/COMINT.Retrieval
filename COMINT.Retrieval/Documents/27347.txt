information services to trade, industry and the
    professions. the large public library, such as the johannesburg
    public library, south africa, that is situated in an area with
    many special libraries, can provide an information service to
    the general public who are without access to the special
    libraries. such a library can often provide reference material
    which is not specialised enough for the special library while
    not popular enough for the smaller public library. at least
    some information sources on a very wide range of subjects are
    required. the library staff cannot be experts on all these
    fields. they consequently refer users to information sources
    and expect users to do their own searching. users often fall in
    the small business category and are without libraries of their
    own. the information they need may sometimes not be available
    in a form applicable to the south african situation. the
    johannesburg public library serves as a depository for the
    journals received by many scientific a nd technical societies
    in johannesburg, and in some cases the library manages and
    maintains the library of a society within the jpl building.
    rendering information services is one way to show that the
    library is using public money to good advantage.
