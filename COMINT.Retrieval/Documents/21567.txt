a psycho-educational basis for classifying readers. in
    order to develop reading on an individual basis, the librarian
    must be able to categorise his readers. this can be done by a
    psycho-educational method, considering both the actual reading
    ability and motives of the reader. 'reading ability' should
    take account of' direction in reading (purposiveness); ability
    to select books; and ability to absorb conceptual content.
    readers' motives are divided into' those whose reading is
    directed towards developing their social and moral outlook;
    those who need help in choosing a career; those who read to
    develop their personality; but further sub-divisions may also
    be worked out.
