parallel ferroresonant feedback type trigger circuit
    consisting of an ac winding on a ferromagnetic core shunted by
    a capacitance with auxiliary windings for excitation and
    polarization may be adjusted to present two and in certain
    conditions three stable states curves are given showing the
    influence of the various parameters
