breakdown and leakage resistance investigation of
    metallized paper capacitors the basis of comparison between
    conventional paper and metallized paper capacitors is discussed
    experiments on units with polyester impregnants suggest that if
    self healing is of primary importance a pure aliphatic
    hydrocarbon type of impregnant will give best results
