propagation of electromagnetic waves in a gyrotropic
    medium faradays law of rotation of the plane of polarization is
    extended to take account of the reflection and refraction at
    the boundaries of the medium the relation between path length
    and the angle of rotation is derived and results for a lyer of
    are shown graphically for a frequency of
