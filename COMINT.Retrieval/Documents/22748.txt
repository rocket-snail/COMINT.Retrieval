temperatures in the high atmosphere temperature
    distribution is discussed in relation to rocket and radio
    observations on the assumption that heating of the ionosphere
    is due primarily to solar radiation and that temperature
    distribution is controlled by thermal conduction a model is
    presented which indicates a very rapid temperature rise between
    and km this would produce a density distribution in agreement
    with observations
