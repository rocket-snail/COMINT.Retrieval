coupled cavity travelling wave parametric amplifiers
    analysis detailed information is given on operating
    characteristics of a travelling wave circuit consisting of a
    chain of inductivity coupled cavities loaded by diodes in the
    capacitive region calculations show that unilateral gains of
    over relatively wide bandwidths are attainable with
    diodes
