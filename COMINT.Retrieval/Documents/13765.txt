harmonics in the spectra of solar radio disturbances
    investigations over the frequency range indicate that spectral
    features of solar noise bursts are commonly duplicated at of
    below the frequency of the second harmonic the results are
    consistent with the hypothesis that the fundamental frequency
    corresponds to the natural plasma frequency of the corona in
    the vicinity of the source by applying this result to a
    standard model of the corona information is deduced regarding
    the position velocity and size of the sources velocities were
    found for two long duration outbursts and velocities as great
    as for short lived type bursts the generation of bursts may be
    associated with longitudinal plasma oscillations excited by
    fast streams of charged particles
