some solutions to the equations of steady space charge
    flow in magnetic fields earlier analysis is extended to include
    the case of magnetic field components perpendicular to the
    cathode sets of solutions are given for the flow from conical
    and cylindrical cathodes for a broad class of magnetic field
    configurations
