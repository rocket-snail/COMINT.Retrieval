electrodynamic averaged boundary conditions for wire mesh
    equations and are derived which form a system of boundary
    conditions relating the averaged tangential components of the
    electric and magnetic fields on the surface of the mesh to the
    e averaged surface density of the current in the mesh the
    results obtained are illustrated by calculating the reflection
    of a plane wave from a plane uniform mesh and by determining
    the screening effect of a spherical mesh with respect to a
    small turn of wire carrying a current and located at the centre
    of the sphere
