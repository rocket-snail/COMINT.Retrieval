the effect of long transmission lines on klystron
    oscillators discussion of effects occurring when the oscillator
    load is several wavelengths away from the valve equivalent
    circuits are applied to analysis of the fm distortion and of
    the discontinuities in the klystron characteristics
    experimental results are presented which corroborate the
    theory
