the distribution over the emitting area of x radiation
    from the solar corona and the residual intensity during total
    solar eclipses the e layer is assumed to be ionized by xrays of
    approximate wavelength a the intensity of coronal radiation in
    this waveband is calculated and the results lead to a
    considerable degree of limb brightening and to emission of
    radiation at radii greater than that of the visible disk the
    intensity of the residual radiation during total eclipses can
    be calculated and is estimated to have been about in and and
    about in
