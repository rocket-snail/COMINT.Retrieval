the formation of the d region of the ionosphere a review
    of theoretical studies of the ionization process in the d
    region it is possible to explain normal conditions of
    ionization by cosmic rays and lyman radiation conditions due to
    solar flares must be explained by x rays above km the
    ionization is related to the formation of the e layer
