the parallel t dc amplifier a low drift amplifier with
    wide frequency response the frequency response of a modulated
    dc amplifier is broadened by the parallel addition of a
    conventional ac amplifier which has inherently a response
    capable of being made complementary to that of the dc amplifier
    the result is a homogeneous design without excessive phase
    shift circuit details are given of an amplifier designed for
    use with a high speed pen recorder in the frequency range the
    avoidance of direct coupling renders the use of electrometer
    valves unnecessary
