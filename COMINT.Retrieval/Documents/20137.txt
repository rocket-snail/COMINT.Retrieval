some acquisition problems in bulgaria. the special
    commission for acquisition coordination, particularly with
    respect to foreign periodicals and other publications, has been
    in operation for more than 20 years. during that time, several
    national venues have taken place under the auspices of the
    commission to keep librarians abreast of the latest
    developments, in particular in the field of international
    exchange of publications. 1 of the latest seminars dealt with
    copyright problems after the wide introduction of modern
    reprographic equipment. international exchange has been firmly
    established in major bulgarian libraries, including the cyril
    and methodius national library, the bulgarian academy of
    sciences library and the university of sofia library. exchange
    is the only way to reduce the depletive effect of the rapidly
    growing prices of western periodicals and books on the foreign
    currency allowances available to bulgarian libraries. the
    commission's foremost task is to remove obstacles a nd to
    encourage further positive steps in this important section of
    library and information services.
