some measurements on a not selfsustaining gas discharge
    with an axial magnetic field report of investigations of the
    potential distribution inside the central arc column of the
    discharge the experimental arrangement consists of a
    cylindrical anode with a filamentary cathode at one end and a
    reflector at the other and a hot probe with electronegative
    gases deep troughs of negative potential are observed with
    electropositive gases the central plasma potentials are still
    negative in relation to the anode
