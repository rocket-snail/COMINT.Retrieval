standards, specifications, and codes' a union list
    approach to resource sharing in the chicago metropolitan area.
    as a result of more sophisticated technology and a growing
    consumer pressure for product reliability, manufacturers,
    engineers, governmental representatives, and the general public
    alike are requiring improved access to standards and
    specifications. traditionally, this information resource has
    been difficult to identify, to control, and to service. as a
    response to this problem, a small task force of chicago area
    technical librarians conducted a survey of area users to
    ascertain what standards collections were available, what the
    level of need for standards might actually be, and the extent
    to which existing collections might be shared among
    users.
