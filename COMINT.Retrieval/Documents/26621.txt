contact charging between nonconductors and metal the
    investigation previously reported of september was continued
    using spheres of fused quartz and borosilicate glass rolling n
    on a clean ni surface and introducing improvements in the
    method the surface conductivity of the glass was found to be
    higher than that of the quartz by three or four orders of
    magnitude since the charging of the two materials was of the
    same order of magnitude it appears that the effective work
    function of the glass is considerably higher than that of the
    quartz
