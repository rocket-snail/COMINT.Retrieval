stagnation in the kibbutz library. 2 characteristics of
    kibbutz libraries are giving cause for concern;
    decentralisation; and the average age of kibbutz librarians.
    decentralisation has historic and social causes. formerly, most
    librarians were volunteers and various groups in the kibbutz
    population had separate areas of residence and activity. modern
    kibbutz society and organisation have changed, but many small
    libraries have remained in existence. decentralisation has many
    drawbacks' inefficiency, areas of interest not covered by any
    library, inconvenience of many readers and lack of a strong
    library that could become a focal point in the cultural life of
    the kibbutz. the 24 librarians serving in the kibbutzim
    surveyed averaged 53.3 years, only 5 of them being younger than
    50. this situation rules out much in the way of development and
    innovation. calls for a serious academic study of kibbutz
    libraries.
