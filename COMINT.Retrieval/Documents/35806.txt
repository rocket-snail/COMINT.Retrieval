the teaching pamphlets produced by the staff of the
    institute of library science and scientific information at the
    humboldt university, berlin. the pamphlet series developed
    since 1970, originally for use in correspondence courses on
    basic and post-graduate librarianship, but is now used also in
    classes at the library school. the humboldt university combines
    a basic training for both librarians and documentalists with
    additional specialist options; the structure of the basic
    library school and correspondence courses is identical. the
    pamphlets provide an introduction for the student to work with
    readers, information work, library stocks, cataloguing,
    bibliography, documentation and storage and political studies.
    the series will expand to include more detailed monographs on
    various aspects of librarianship, as has already happened with
    a similar series produced in the ussr.
