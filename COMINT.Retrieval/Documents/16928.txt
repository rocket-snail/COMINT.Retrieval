the rates of production and loss of electrons in the
    region of the ionosphere from the results of the rates of
    production and loss of electrons in the region are deduced
    bradburys theory of the formation of the layers is shown to be
    self consistent it gives a scale height of for the ionizable
    constituent of the atmosphere between and this result agrees
    better with the atmospheric model deduced by bates from rocket
    experiments than with the model deduced from experiments made
    on the ground limits are established for the movements caused
    by electron diffusion under gravity
