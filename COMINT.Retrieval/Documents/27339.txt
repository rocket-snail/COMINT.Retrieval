scandinavian cooperation in the library field: a critical
    examination. reflections on the value and/or necessity of
    pan-scandinavian library conferences, recalling their past
    achievements in attaining cooperation between public and
    special libraries, and in expressing an intangible but definite
    scandinavian unity. today, while several scandinavian
    organisations are formally involved in library cooperation, the
    conferences act as catalysts for latent progress and fruitful
    discontent. they should reflect professional activity since the
    last conference, and reveal any resulting common denominators.
    their main function will continue to be a market-place for
    ideas, in a setting adapted to the establishing and developing
    of professional, social and personal relationships.
