dc ac converter utilizing the space charge capacitance of
    a valve two circuits are described for converting feeble dc to
    ac prior to amplification for measurement purposes both make
    use of the variation of grid cathode capacitance with the
    voltage applied to the grid the first circuit using a bridge
    balanced for a certain value of the grid cathode capacitance so
    that any variation produces a proportionate deflection of a
    meter the second circuit uses a balanced arrangement of two
    valves with a differential transformer zero stability is good
    in both cases
