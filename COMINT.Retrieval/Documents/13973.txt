waveguide switching device using gas filled tubes an
    arrangement for switching a single receiver between two or more
    channels at a relatively high rate is described the switching
    operation is based on detuning an oscillatory circuit
    consisting of a waveguide section terminated with inductive
    diaphragms and having a gas discharge tube located midway
    between the ends the hf susceptance of the tube varies with its
    ionization state and the tube constitutes an element of a
    bandpass filter analysis is given for the pass band the
    switching rate the electrical inertia and the noise and
    insertion loss due to the device results obtained with a four
    channel system are in good agreement with theory
