harmonic distortion and negative feedback different
    methods of defining gain in relation to the output voltage
    input voltage characteristic of an amplifier are discussed for
    a nonlinear amplifier it is reasonable to base the definition
    on the average slope a method is indicated for constructing the
    characteristic of the amplifier with feedback from that of the
    amplifier without distortion can be reduced by means of
    feedback even for flat regions of the characteristic this
    result is in disagreement with that of rowlands of detailed
    analysis is given for several types of amplifier
