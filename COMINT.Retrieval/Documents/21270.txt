some transistor circuits the characteristics of junction
    transistors are discussed at frequencies of the equivalent
    circuit is already as complicated as that of a thermionic valve
    at frequencies a hundred times higher particular circuits
    examined include one for a medium wave broadcast receiver in
    which the selectivity is automatically increased as the signal
    strength decreases it is pointed out that for a peak output
    power of the consumption is nonlinear distortion in transistors
    is compared with the corresponding effect in thermionic valves
    the upper frequency limit set by cut off of current
    amplification is considered in relation to trigger circuits a
    circuit including a and an transistor is shown which has
    properties resembling those of a gas filled valve with
    adjustable ignition voltage short ignition time very low
    discharge voltage drop and discharge noise
