on deriving geomagnetic dipole field coordinates from
    cosmic ray observations the coordinates of an equivalent dipole
    representing the external geomagnetic field can be determined
    from measurements of the nucleonic component longitude and
    latitude effects in the region of the geomagnetic equator the
    measurement method and the relevant theory are outlined
