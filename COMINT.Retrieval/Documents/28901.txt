the surface barrier transistor part circuit applications
    of surface barrier transistors the operating characteristics of
    the surface barrier transistor are discussed and two amplifier
    circuits are described namely a wide band low pass amplifier
    and a band pass amplifier for a centre frequency of this type
    of transistor combines the ability to operate at vhf with the
    low power consumption o of the junction type part below
