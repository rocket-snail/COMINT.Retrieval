the excitation of plasma oscillations a beam of high
    energy electrons injected into the plasma of a dc discharge
    from an auxiliary electron gun excited oscillations in the
    plasma the standing wave patterns set up for varying values of
    electron beam density and thickness of the ion space charge
    sheath being investigated by a movable probe discontinuous
    changes in oscillation frequency occurred as either the
    electron density or the sheath thickness was varied but the
    frequencies were in accordance with the tonks langmuir relation
    and wehners transit time relation of in both cases the results
    confirm that the mechanism of energy transfer involved is a vm
    process as suggested by wehner and indicate that the
    oscillation is a longitudinal pressure wave set up in the
    plasma electrons
