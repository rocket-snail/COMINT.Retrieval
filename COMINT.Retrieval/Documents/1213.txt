possibility of luminescent quantum yields greater than
    unity it is shown that an excited sensitizer can transfer its
    energy simultaneously to two activators under suitable
    conditions leading to two emitted photons per incident higher
    energy photon the probability of this transfer process is
    computed and the process is shown to be experimentally
    feasible
