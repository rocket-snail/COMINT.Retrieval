monitoring the demand for the services of academic
    libraries-the survey as a library management tool for capital
    services. examines issues in the monitoring and control of seat
    use for study purposes in higher education libraries' reports
    briefly on an experimental monitoring system which adopts a
    rotating sample survey design to obtain information on this
    important attribute of library user behaviour, which with a
    high degree of initial organisation has been found capable of
    being usefully implemented by library staff with little survey
    training. the survey, undertaken at the frewen library,
    portsmouth polytechnic (uk), produced a good response from
    users, was swift in implementation and caused little disruption
    of library activity.
