velocity of movement of sporadic e clouds curves of the
    diurnal variation of the e layer critical frequency for o four
    japanese stations indicate a progressive retardation of the
    time of occurrence of the maximum on passing from the highest
    latitude to the lower latitude stations a value of about is
    deduced for the horizontal component of the velocity of the e
    clouds this is of the same order as the velocity of e layer
    winds found by various methods
