a note on the theory of semiconductors two different
    theories are obtained depending on whether the free energy due
    to the spin of electrons in impurity centres is or is not taken
    into account the second of these alternatives is essentially
    that adopted by wilson and has been used almost universally
    though the first which is that adopted by mott and gurney
    electronic processes in ionic crystals can be applied to
    degenerate semiconductors and is to be preferred
