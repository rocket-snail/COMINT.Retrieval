some remarks concerning ionospheric absorption work
    irregularities in the frequency dependence of observed
    absorption decrements are attributed to focusing effects due to
    curvature of the layers involved in the layer these effects
    occur particularly with third order echoes account should be
    taken of the effect in the analysis of absorption observations
    made during conditions of rapid fading
