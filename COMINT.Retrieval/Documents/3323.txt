theory of plasma resonance in solids the modes of a
    confined plasma are studied for simple geometries modes are
    closely spaced in frequency and unresolvable unless the sample
    size is comparable to the debye length observation in small
    samples is made difficult by line broadening due to surface
    scattering but might be possible in a suitably designed
    experiment
