spectral investigations in the wavelength range around mm
    a description is given of the construction an method of
    operation of an infrared type spectrometer which has been used
    with thermal radiator and receiver to obtain absorption spectra
    at wavelengths over mm the spectrum obtained for water vapour
    over the range mm is shown as an example results obtained with
    hcn and are also reported
