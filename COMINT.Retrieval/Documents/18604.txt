the attenuation of alfven waves when the collision
    frequency in an ionized gas is smaller than the wave frequency
    it is not permissible to treat the gas as a continuous fluid
    the equations for alfven waves are obtained by working with
    distribution functions the results illustrate the behavior of a
    gas when the collision frequency is low and may have
    applications in the interstellar gas or in the earths outer
    atmosphere
