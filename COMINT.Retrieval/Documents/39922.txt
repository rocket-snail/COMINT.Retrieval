characteristics of ionospheric disturbances during severe
    magnetic storms analysis of world wide data from ionosphere
    stations for the period may including two geomagnetic storms
    with sudden commencements shows that an ionospheric disturbance
    coincident with a sc in a region of high geomagnetic latitude
    spreads down to lower latitudes in high latitudes the
    disturbances travel at a high velocity which is about in the
    vicinity of japan the intensity of the disturbance decreases
    with latitude the connection between the time of occurrence of
    a sc and disturbance of radio communication is briefly
    discussed
