digital field computers to eliminate the speed limitation
    of conventional digital techniques for field computations a
    nonuniversal unitary system is proposed based on the analogy
    between electron flow through a resistance network and the flow
    of pulses through a network of computer units an integral
    number n is represented by n pulses and a basic unit generates
    a train of synchronized pulses from two input pulse trains of n
    and n pulses the interconnection of a lattice of basic units
    gives a finite difference representation of the general field
