an equalizing network for carrier type feedback control
    systems the analysis of an active high q rlc circuit shows that
    it permits lag compensation of carrier type feedback control
    systems through direct operation on the system actuating signal
    the use of this circuit in an instrument type velocity servo
    reduces the steady state error by a factor of at least
