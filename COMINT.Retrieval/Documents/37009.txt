the breakdown of gases subject to crossed electric fields
    the effect of an auxiliary electric field acting at right
    angles to a field on the breakdown stress of various gases is
    investigated experimentally when the auxiliary field is
    unidirectional or of relatively low frequency its application
    raises the break down stress but when its frequency reaches the
    two fields appear to act independently a partial explanation is
    advanced the gases studied include air oxygen nitrogen hydrogen
    and neon
