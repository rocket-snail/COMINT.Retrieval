design of practical linear networks with optimum signal
    noise ratios a general method is described for the design of
    networks for which the relation between the input and output
    signals is represented by linear equations the frequency
    spectra of signal and noise being assumed known the application
    of the method of analysis in the design of the optimum
    ionization chamber amplifier is illustrated and the signal
    noise ratios attainable are compared with those for an rc
    discrimination network and a delay line clipping circuit
