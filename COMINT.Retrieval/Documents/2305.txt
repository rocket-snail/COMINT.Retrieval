electromagnetic signals from nuclear explosions in outer
    space x rays produced by a nuclear burst in outer space cause
    polarization currents in the medium which if distributed
    anisotropically will emit em radiation a rough calculation
    indicates that a detectable signal is produced at a range of
    from a burst of x ray energy equivalent to ton of high
    explosive the signal power varies as the square of the electron
    density so this effect may provide a sensitive measure of the
    electron density in outer space
