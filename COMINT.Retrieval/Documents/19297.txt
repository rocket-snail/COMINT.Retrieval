short time stability of a quartz crystal oscillator as
    measured with an ammonia maser appreciable improvement in the
    short time stability is achieved by immersing the crystal in
    liquid helium control of the pressure of the gas above the
    liquid improves the long time stability though adversely
    affecting the short time stability
