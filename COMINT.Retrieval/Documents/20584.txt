the finnish way of public library automation.
    contribution to a finnish issue. the metropolitan area
    consisting of helsinki, espoo, vantaa, and kauniainen cities
    has provided a framework for cooperative library automation.
    the city libraries are aiming at establishing joint data
    systems and data bases, while maintaining their independence as
    local government units. the automated circulation control and
    book file updating systems are already operational; the
    cataloguing system will be started once a national decision
    regarding centralised library services has been made; and the
    acquisitions system development work was due to commence in
    spring 81.
