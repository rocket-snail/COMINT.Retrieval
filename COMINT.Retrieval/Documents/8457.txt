a clipper with automatic mark space ratio control a
    rectangular wave with mark space ratio independent of the
    amplitude and harmonic content of the input wave is produced by
    controlling th bias level of the first clipping stage by means
    of a special feedback circuit incorporating a mark space ratio
    discriminator
