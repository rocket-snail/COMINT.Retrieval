distribution of radio frequency brightness across the
    solar disk at a wavelength of cm results of three
    investigations see also and above indicate appreciable limb
    brightening contrary to results reported by stanier of there
    has been a marked change of brightness during the sunspot cycle
    the radial extent of the distribution is greater at the equator
    than at the poles
