on variations of the geomagnetic field fluid motions and
    the rate of the earths rotation brouwers results above are
    compared with changes with time in the westward drift of fluid
    moving near the surface of the earths central core as inferred
    from the westward drift of the eccentric dipole field of
    geomagnetism
