transformation for constant impedance networks certain
    constant impedance networks having a restricted range of
    variation of loss often contain components which are difficult
    to manufacture the transformation which is described overcomes
    this difficulty at the expense of two extra resistors in the
    network and a small amount of frequency independent loss added
    to the characteristics another application is the absorption of
    inductor dissipation in special cases
