a stabilized dc supply unit for output voltages of to a
    circuit is described in which the whole of the output voltage
    variation is available for controlling the amplifying valve so
    that the gain is the same for any output voltage down to zero
    the control valve is a pentode whose screen grid voltage is
    stabilized by means of a stabilizer tube the filaments of the
    amplifying valves which are also fed from this source have low
    consumption variation of the output voltage is for mains
    fluctuations up to
