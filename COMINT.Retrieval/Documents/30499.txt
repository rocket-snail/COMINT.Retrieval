empirical transient formulae relations between the steady
    state frequency response of a network and its transient
    response are derived in terms of shape parameters the most
    important of which for the transient response are rise time
    overshoot and relaxation time two classes of network are
    considered those with a flat topped frequency response curve
    with a single peak at zero centre frequency and those whose
    frequency response curve exhibits two equal maxima located
    symmetrically about x zero centre frequency it is concluded
    that the network giving most failful reproduction of a unit
    step has a trapezoidal frequency response curve and that
    compromise is required in design as between ideal frequency
    response and ideal transient response
