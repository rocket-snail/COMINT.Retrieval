design of open ended microwave resonant cavities two
    types of cavity for refractive index measurements are described
    one rectangular in cross section the other cylindrical the
    cavities are termin ted in short sections partitioned so that
    each sub division is a waveguide operating below the cut off
    frequency of the cavity
