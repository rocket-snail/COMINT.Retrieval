guiding of whistlers by the magnetic field a mechanism is
    proposed which explains the wideband noise observed during
    whistler reception a particle moving with velocity where is
    gyrofrequency and is plasma frequency causes a wave to be
    propagated along the earths magnetic field all frequency
    components of the wave travel with the same velocity see of
