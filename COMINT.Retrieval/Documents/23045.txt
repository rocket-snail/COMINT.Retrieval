power gain in feedback amplifier a search is made for a
    network figure of merit shich remains invariant for different
    connection conditions a quantity is found satisfying this
    requirement and identified as the available power gain when
    coupling is chosen to make the device unilateral the quantity
    may be useful for classifying active networks its value is
    unity for a gyrator the method directs interest to power gain
    and signal flow considerations rather than to voltage gain and
    the network interpretation of an impedance matrix
