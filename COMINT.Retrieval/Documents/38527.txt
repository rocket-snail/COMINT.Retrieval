large reduction of free electromagnetic oscillations in
    cylindrical regions due to slight departures from cylindricity
    a theoretical investigation of the effect of small deformations
    on long cylindrical resonators with perfectly conducting walls
    the diminution of the field is proportional to the product of
    the relative distortion and the square of the ratio of the
    length of the cylinder to its radius standard mathematical
    notation is used and the expressions for are given in terms of
    bessel functions and the function which is defined as the root
    of j
