pulse amplitude analysis in nuclear research various
    voltage discrimination techniques are discussed in detail and
    descriptions are given of a simple type of analyser and a
    moderate precision and a high precision analyser analysers are
    also discussed in which pulse height selection is effected
    either by mechanical means or by use of diode valves trigger
    circuits sorting ladder circuits or beam deflection techniques
    other types of analyser described include those in which height
    selection is accomplished by an expander amplifier driving a
    chain of discriminators by conversion of pulse amplitude to
    pulse duration by means of information storage devices
