antiferromagnetism a survey paper the distinction between
    antiferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism is indicated the former
    is found mainly in simple inorganic compounds the latter in
    complex compounds problems discussed concern the interaction
    between adjacent dipoles the different possible arrangements
    within the various lattices the magnetic properties and the
    phenomena of the transition from order to disorder
