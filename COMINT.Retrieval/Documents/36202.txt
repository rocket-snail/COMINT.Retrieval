feature comparison of an in-house information retrieval
    system with a commercial search service. a commercially
    available on-line search service was used as a standard for
    comparative searching and evaluation of an in-house information
    system based on automatic indexing. system features were
    identified and evaluated on the basis of their usefulness in
    various kinds of searching, their ease in implementation, and
    how they are influenced by differences in user type or specific
    applications. some common features of the commercial system,
    such as on-line instruction, user-specified print formats,
    dictionary display, and truncation, are seen to be unnecessary
    or impractical for the in-house system.
