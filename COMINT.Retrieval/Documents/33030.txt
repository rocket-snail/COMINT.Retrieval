can the lean years give children's libraries new
    opportunities?. the children's library's main tasks remain
    those of a century ago:- to encourage aptitudes and skills, to
    disseminate knowledge, both through fiction and factual books,
    to provide experience, whether from informative non-fiction,
    satisfying the child's curiosity, or from fiction, allowing for
    emotional identification, to educate, especially ideologically.
    some norwegian communities still maintain strict ethical and
    religious book selection standards; librarians must be clear
    about their own selection criteria. children's librarians must
    publicise their work and problems, cooperating where possible
    with the mass media, and make the 1980s a decade of
    opportunity.
