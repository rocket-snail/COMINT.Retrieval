active error feedback and its application to a specific
    driver circuit feedback amplifiers are discussed in which the
    feedback signal is nominally equal to the input the difference
    which is proportional to the distortion or error in the output
    is amplified in s a separate circuit and reinjected with the
    proper polarity to reduce the output error analysis is given
    for a cathode follower circuit incorporating this principle the
    arrangement is especially suitable for driving the grid of an
    output valve highly positive experimental results support the
    theory
