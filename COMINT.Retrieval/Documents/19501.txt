problems and tasks of libraries in higher education.
    libraries in higher education must make the most of their
    existing premises as construction of new library buildings has
    been severely restricted, at least for the time being. however,
    in spite of the conditions, library and information services
    must be under constant review with their improvement in mind.
    branches established in the students' halls of residence have
    to provide all students with basic study literature. the
    central library of any particular establishment has to cater
    for centralised and coordinated acquisitions and processing.
    use of literature by students and teaching staff must also be
    followed up and obsolete items discarded. greater attention
    must be paid to political and other literature dealing with
    social sciences, especially in faculties of applied science. it
    is important to support aesthetic education by audio-visual
    materials. the role of computerised information systems, now on
    a trial basis in schools of econ omics, will grow in future.
    for expert advice libraries in higher education have to look
    above all to the university library in sofia with its
    methodological department and special councils in many spheres
    of knowledge.
