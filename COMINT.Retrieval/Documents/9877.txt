the radio frequency coaxial resistor using a tractorial
    jacket design of resistors for the reflection free termination
    of coaxial lines is discussed using an approach based on
    treatment of a short length of the resistor as a conical
    coaxial line the resulting profile of the jacket is a tractrix
    detailed analysis indicates that with this configuration the
    field satisfied the boundary conditions better than with an
    exponential jacket the most important design parameter is the
    ratio length diameter for resistances values of this ratio
    between and are satisfactory the difficulty of obtaining
    uniform distribution of resistance over the surface of the
    resistor may be a limiting factor in the accuracy of the
    termination
