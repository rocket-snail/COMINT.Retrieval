an idealized problem of plasma dynamics that bears on
    geomagnetic storm theory an idealized problem is solved a
    cylindrical sheet of neutral ionized gas is projected into a
    magnetic field which is aligned along the cylinder axis and
    varies as where is the distance from the axis for a magnetic
    field comparable in magnitude with that of the earth the sheet
    would be stopped at earth radii for storm and at earth radii
    for storm
