pulling phenomena in valve oscillators a general theory
    of pulling effects is derived on the basis of band filter
    theory these effects are calculated as a function of detuning
    and degree of coupling between similar and dissimilar
    oscillator circuits a mechanical analogue of a pulled
    oscillating system is described
