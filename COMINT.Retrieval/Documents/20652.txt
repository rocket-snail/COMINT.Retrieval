importance of bibliographical control over information
    (in arabic). organisation and retrieval of information have
    become difficult as a result of knowledge explosion and the
    different languages of publication. the main problem is the
    bibliographic control over library materials which can be
    solved by bibliographic works based on the subject and
    qualitative principles. the use of automated bibliographic
    control must be considered.
