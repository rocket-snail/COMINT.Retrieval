what books do people need?. since librarians themselves
    are well educated, there is always a danger that they may cater
    solely for the wishes of an elite minority and, by excluding
    ephemeral literature from stock, discourage many other people
    from using the library. the west german national library plan
    of 1973 states clearly that libraries must cater for everyone,
    even if problems are caused by limited budgets. it is important
    to remember that emphemeral literature has a relaxing effect on
    many people, in contrast to the stimulating effect caused by
    more demanding works. a possible solution would be to exclude
    less valuable material, such as works involving pornography and
    violence and then to include some trivia if careful analysis of
    reader structure demands it.
