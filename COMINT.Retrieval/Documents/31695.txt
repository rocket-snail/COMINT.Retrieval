the parallel and series operation of germanium rectifiers
    the permissible ratings of germanium rectifiers operated in
    series and parallel connections have been calculated for the
    cases where load balancing resistors are placed in parallel and
    in series respectively with the individual rectifiers
    transistorized power supplies for a mass spectrometer magnet
    current supply and filament emission control circuits of low
    power dissipation are described
