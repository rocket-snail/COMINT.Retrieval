    outlined. major conclusions were that services by college
    libraries for external students were varied, and in an
    embryonic stage, and there was urgent need for the development
    of standards for library services to external students. more
    cooperation between the librarian and external studies
    department staff was needed. the conclusions enabled the ciae
    to refine objectives and to expand the concept of the external
    studies library service. note' this abstract is a corrected
