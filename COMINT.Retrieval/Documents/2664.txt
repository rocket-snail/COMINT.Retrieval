transformer analogue network analysers the use of voltage
    transformers as multipliers for complex quantities is explained
    a network analyser is described comprising a measuring section
    and a number of identical panels each with two multiplying
    units these panels can be used to represent impedances
    admittances etc negative resistance and unilateral mutual
    inductance can easily be represented applications discussed
    include the solution of linear simultaneous equations
