information broking in the federal republic of germany. a
    review is given of the underdeveloped information broking
    business in west germany. the situation is characterised by a
    lack of private initiatives and an array of public sector
    services which are useful but insufficient to meet the need of
    the industrial community. international relationships between
    broking agencies should be strengthened.
