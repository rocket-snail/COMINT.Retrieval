amplitude modulation of centimetre waves by means of
    ferroxcube losses in a ferroxcube rod caused by a modulating
    magnetic field vary the amplitude of a centimetre wave
    reflected from it the nature of the losses and the maximum
    frequency at which they occur are examined theoretically an
    experimental circuit has been constructed operating at with a
    modulation frequency of wide bandwidths are not possible
