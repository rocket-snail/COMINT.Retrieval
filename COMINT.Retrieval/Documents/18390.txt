a general network theorem with applications it is proved
    that in a network configuration with branch currents i
    satisfying the node equations and branch voltages satisfying
    the mesh equations summed over all branches is zero using this
    result it is possible to prove the energy theorem and the
    reciprocity relation of networks and to show that if
    arbitrarily varying voltages are applied to a pole network at
    rest the difference between the electric and the magnetic
    energy at any instant depends only on the admittance matrix of
    the pole network and not on the particular network used to
    realize this matrix
