library networks and planning. third and last part. the
    conclusion of a study presented in 1980 at the french ecole
    nationale superieure de bibliothecaires, analysing library
    development plans in the 1960s and 70s implemented in paris and
    montreal. (for parts 1 and 2 see 81/5362 and 81/5363). analyses
    the results, drawing conclusions on the basic differences
    between the paris and montreal situations, the solutions
    proposed, and the reasons for and consequences of certain
    decisions. from the methods used, attempts to develop a theory
    of planning, drawing on principles derived for planning
    strategy, marketing management, and studies of policy decision
    in relation to consumer behaviour. finally considers briefly
    the future course of rationalisation and planning of library
    networks.
