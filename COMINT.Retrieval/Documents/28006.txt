the power factor and capacitance of mica capacitors at
    low frequencies experimental results confirm an empirical law
    of the form negative and fractional for the power factor over
    the range at normal temperatures they also confirm a relation
    between frequency power factor and capacitance power factors as
    high as have been found corresponding to increases of nearly in
    capacitance over the values at higher frequencies
