a proposed new outpatient data collection system. a
    proposed outpatient data collection system is described and
    compared with the current system. 4 major advantages of the
    proposed system are discussed. 1st, the new outpatient data
    collection system could simplify and reduce administrative
    procedures. 2nd, the new data collection system could provide a
    tool for assessing the current state of readiness of
    operational units throughout the navy. 3rd, this system could
    be used as a basis for making predictions concerning staffing
    and material requirements of any medical facility under a
    variety of conditions. finally, the proposed outpatient system
    could be tied to the current inpatient system to derive
    complete medical histories for individual patients. by merging
    the 2 data systems a research tool would be created that could
    provide investigators with an unprecedented opportunity to
    explore the development, distribution, causes, and prevention
    of disease.
