relaxation oscillations in voltage regulator tubes
    relaxation oscillations may occur if the regulator tube is
    shunted by a capacitor and the load line intersects the tube
    characteristic on the low current side of the minimum methods
    of modifying the circuit to prevent these oscillations are
    indicated
