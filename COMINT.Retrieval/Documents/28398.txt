an amplifier based on the hall effect the dc or ac signal
    is fed to a suitably matched coil wound on a laminated magnetic
    core having a narrow gap into which is inserted a thin
    rectangular slice of single crystal insb dc is passed through
    the slice and the hall emf is picked up and applied to a
    matched load high values of power gain are theoretically
    possible an upper frequency limit is set by core losses for
