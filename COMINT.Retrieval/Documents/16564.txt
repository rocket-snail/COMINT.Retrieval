satellite perturbations from extra terrestrial
    gravitation and radiation pressure the equations of motion of a
    satellite are written in terms of displacement components
    relative to the unperturbed elliptic orbit a moving system of
    co ordinates is used which consists of an orthogonal triad
    whose origin is always located at the nominal satellite
    position on the elliptic orbit
