occultation of a radio star by the solar corona
    interferometers of high resolving power were used to reduce the
    amplitude of the record from the undisturbed sunduring
    observations of the radio star in taurus as it passed near the
    suns southern limb a decrease of amplitude occurred on both and
    when the angular separation of star and sun was as great as ten
    times the angular radius of the visible disk the amplitude
    decreases being greatest when the angular separation approached
    its minimum value the results will be discussed in a later
    paper
