the academic librarian. the career of a librarian should
    combine the practical side of librarianship with academic
    knowledge and research. nowadays new research in library
    science is usually carried out in teams rather than by
    individuals. modern librarians have to possess a wide range of
    knowledge covering many fields and it is no longer usual for a
    librarian to be an expert in only 1 subject. teachers at
    library schools are often part-time librarians and provide
    students with an understanding of daily library activity, which
    prevents courses from becoming merely theoretical. the changing
    structure of academic libraries is reflected in the syllabuses
    of library schools which devote more time to current library
    and information science subjects than before.
