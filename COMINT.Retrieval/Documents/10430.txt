library association and library education' a continuing
    problem. it is often suprising to enquirers to learn that the
    library association of singapore (las) has so many qualified
    librarians and yet singapore has no library school. library
    education has been a perplexing problem through the 25 years of
    existence of the las. discusses the need for a library school
    in singapore, and traces the history of developments in library
    education through the work of the persatuan perpustakaan
    malaysia, and the las, renamed in 1966 as persatuan
    perpustakaan singapura. looks forward to the time when the
    question of formal library education would be reviewed more
    regularly by library authorities.
