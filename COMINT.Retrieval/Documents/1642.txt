poetry, coffee and cakes: poetry cafe ostergard.
    describes the efforts of halmstad public library to promote
    poetry. swedish public libraries acquire very little poetry,
    and poetry evenings are an exception. poetry cafe ostergard
    began in autumn 80 with evening gatherings held in halmstad's
    branch library in ostergard school. the aim was not to replace
    halmstad central library's author evenings, but to complement
    them with activities in a branch library. new forms were sought
    which involved the participants in active listening and
    conversation. a cafe atmosphere with coffee and cakes was
    created. many of the poets lived locally. the library prints
    posters and advertises in the local press and radio prior to
    each evening and prepares free folders with poems and
    introductions to the poets. emphasises that there must be
    continuity through regular activities and that more personal
    contact to promote the evenings and more participation by
    amateur poets are needed if the cafe is to cont inue.
