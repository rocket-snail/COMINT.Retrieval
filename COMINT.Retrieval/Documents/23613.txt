preliminary results of the ionospheric solar eclipse of
    an analysis of critical frequency data obtained in grahamstown
    during this annular eclipse the effects may be explained to a
    first approximation by assuming that the radiation responsible
    for the ionosphere structure is distributed uniformly over the
    suns disk values of recombination coefficient for the and
    layers are in good agreement with values obrained recently by
    independent methods
