secondary processes active in the electrical breakdown of
    gases results of recent investigations indicate the complexity
    of gas breakdown mechanisms three cathode mechanisms and two
    anode mechanisms are analysed and their relative importance and
    the conditions for their occurrence are discussed they lead to
    the same type of generalized threshold breakdown condition
    subject to statistical fluctuations and to space charge effects
    this condition masks the active processes and renders analysis
    difficult the various factors affecting the discharge are
    considered n and proper methods of discharge investigation are
    indicated
