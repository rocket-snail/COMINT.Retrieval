continually changing. comments on the report of the boras
    library high school, sweden for 1979-80. the changing forms of
    the education for librarianship and the question of an
    education for tutor librarians are discussed. when reviewing
    the capacity of the school it is clear that it has not
    responded well to the changing labour market, sometimes
    producing over-, sometimes undercapacity. criticises the plans
    for several shorter training courses as they might reduce
    interest in the 2-year librarianship course. discusses also
    whether the education for librarianship should be general with
    specialisation after a foundation course, as the student
    representatives want, or whether specialised courses should be
    available earlier, and argues for more librarians with special
    knowledge of administration, information work, and outreach
    activities, which cannot be acquired through costly in-service
    training.
