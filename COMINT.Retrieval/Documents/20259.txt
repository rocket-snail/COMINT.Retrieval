has the discussion about school libraries finished?.
    since the early 19th century, the value of a centrally situated
    school library open to the general public and encouraging a
    life-long learning process has been widely discussed. the
    discussion received fresh impetus after 1970 with the
    development of usa, uk and scandinavian school media centres
    and renewed interest in the social and educational functions of
    school libraries. classrooms must be closely connected with the
    school media centre; their evolution into class media centres
    has only occurred so far in primary schools, a change demanding
    good organisation and close links with the public library
    system. the triangular relationship classroom-school media
    centre-public library can be equated with emunds' '3-tier'
    library system; each component must have its tasks clearly
    defined.
