a stable dc source of low voltage with low internal
    resistance a mainsdriven source providing a direct voltage of
    constant to within for mains voltage variations of and current
    drain of uses a magnetic amplifier as an impedance transformer
    to provide a very low output resistance from a gas filled
    reference tube type long term stability depends mainly on the
    reference tube which has a nominal drift of per h after an
    aging period
