market receptivity for an extended m.l.s. as part of its
    study of an extended master's degree programme, the graduate
    school of library science at the university of illinois at
    urbana-champaign distributed a questionnaire to a
    representative cross-section of public, academic, school, and
    special librarians, soliciting their responses to the relative
    merits of (1) a 1-year versus extended master's programme in
    library science and (2) a 1-year master's in library science
    with and without a 2nd master's in another subject. the
    responses indicated that respondents were speaking in terms of
    their own training and experience, rather than in terms of
    future developments and needs in libraries. the survey results
    are thus best described as useful but inconclusive.
