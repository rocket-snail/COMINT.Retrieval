possible identification of atmospheric waves associated
    with ionospheric storms the onset time of an ionospheric storm
    is defined as the time of first increase at and the velocity is
    determined by measuring the time delay at godley head north of
    campbell island the mean northward velocity for eight well
    defined storms was found to be in the range and may correspond
    to the velocity of a neutral gaseous wave as indicated by the
    johnston island nuclear explosion disturbance
