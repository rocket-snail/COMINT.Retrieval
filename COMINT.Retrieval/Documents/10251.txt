the elgin county public library system. the elgin county
    (ontario) library association was founded in 1936; it was a
    cooperative venture and by 1964 it had 12 member libraries.
    these were independent libraries and most had somewhat
    precarious financial support from the county council, local
    council, and interested individuals and organisations. in 1964,
    a fully tax supported county public library was suggested to
    replace the association. this was agreed and the new system was
    founded in 1966. briefly describes the system's development to
    date, financing, and plans for the future.
