travelling wave resonator a circuit comprising a
    directional coupler with the secondary arm ports connected to
    form a continuous loop is used for storing energy extracted
    from the primary in a wave which circulates around the loop an
    x band version used in testing for high power breakdown is
    briefly described presented at the national electronics
