some questions on dealing with special documents. the
    current czechoslovak standard csn 01 0195 (bibliographical and
    cataloguing record) does not contain an exhaustive description
    of special documents, but a reworking of this standard is
    planned in the near future. thus, a more detailed guidance must
    be sought in various cataloguing directives published between
    1969 and 71, which give a good description and numerous
    practical examples. special materials briefly discussed are
    sheet music and records, patents and standards, graphics and
    audiovisuals, archive material and documents. rational approach
    to work with special documents includes group cataloguing and
    machine processing, especially of technical material.
    methodological centres should extablish which materials cause
    libraries the most problems and devise ways of solving
    them.
