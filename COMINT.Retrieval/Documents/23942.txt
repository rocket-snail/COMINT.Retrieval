dipole resonant modes of an ionized gas column a
    quasistatic treatment is used to show that numerous oscillation
    modes are possible in a cylindrical column of ionized gas with
    a rotationally symmetrical distribution of electron
    concentration of electron concentration the theory provides a
    qualitative explanation of the rf reflection of em waves
    observed by romell of approximate values of the resonance
    frequencies are calculated assuming a gaussian radial
    distribution of electron concentration some of the results may
    be verifiable by meteor trail echo observations an
    investigation is also made of the finite energy loss and phase
    shift shown by herlofson of and others to occur when the real
    part of the dielectric constant vanishes
