diffraction patterns in circular apertures less than one
    wavelength in diameter measurements were made of the field
    intensity at points along the aperture diameters parallel
    respectively to the electric and magnetic vectors using
    normally incident radiation of wavelengths cm and cm the
    results disagree with values calculated from youngs theory in
    two respects viz the observations indicate a sharp increase at
    the ends of the diameter parallel to the magnetic vector the
    observed central peak for apertures of diameter near was
    greater than the calculated value the high intensity being
    attributed to multiple reflections from the edges
