the solution of passive electrical networks by means of
    mathematical trees a new method of solution for network
    problems is based on the properties of certain basic types of
    network termed trees and trees linkage functions defined in
    terms of sets of trees and trees obey laws analogous to those
    of kirchhoff so that relations involving voltages and currents
    can be expressed in terms of linkages results of the method are
    given in terms of admittances
