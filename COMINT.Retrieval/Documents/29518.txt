the management of technological innovation. a paper
    presented at a 1979 quebec corporation des bibliothecaires
    professionnels conference, considering how librarians should
    approach the introduction of new technology. the necessity of
    planning is illustrated by examples of various canadian
    university projects, and the sophisticated management
    procedures of today compared with the early experimental phase
    in the 1960s. planning involves consideration of costs,
    benefits and operational satisfaction in the preliminary phase,
    while implementation chiefly involves management of human
    relations, and the adoption of a systematic approach to change
    which takes account of the wider implications of altering
    current practices. librarians attitudes to automation vary, but
    the essential goal is improvement of existing techniques, not
    innovation for its own sake, with the emphasis on economic
    management, efficient service provision, and harmonious user
    relations.
