conductivity of plasmas to microwaves plasma
    conductivities for electrons with a maxwellian energy
    distribution are evaluated for the cases in which the collision
    cross section independent of the velocity and inversely
    proportional to the velocity the corresponding distribution
    functions of relaxation times are discussed
