measurements of lunar reflectivity using the millstone
    radar highly stable coherent pulse measurements made at mc s
    enable range doppler frequency contours to be plotted for the
    rotating moon a precision of two parts in ten for the observed
    doppler frequency has been obtained a number of measurements
    are described substantial echoes are observed out to the lunar
