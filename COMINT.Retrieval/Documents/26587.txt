forces for change in bibliographic business databases.
    the on-line industry has experienced rapid growth in the past
    decade, and the bibliography business files are emerging as one
    of the fastest growing areas of the industry. a number of
    trends in the industry are identified, and their effects on
    bibliographic business data bases are analysed. a key trend is
    that of the availability of more full-text data bases. in the
    next 3-5 years 'hybrid files' consisting of indexing,
    abstracts, and the full texts of documents will emerge as a
    desirable structure for new bibliographic business data
    bases.
