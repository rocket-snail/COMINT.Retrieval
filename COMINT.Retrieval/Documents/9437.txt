incoherent scattering of radio waves by free electrons
    with applications to space exploration by radar a powerful
    radar can detect the incoherent back scatter from free
    electrons in and above the earths atmosphere and the received
    signal is spread in frequency by the doppler shifts associated
    with the thermal motion of the electrons many practical
    applications are discussed including measurements of electron
    density electron temperature auroral ionization and radar
