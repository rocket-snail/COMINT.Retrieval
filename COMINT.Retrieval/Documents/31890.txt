investigation of the temperature dependence of the
    electron work function of metals and semiconductors the
    variation of the work function of copper and nickel sheets was
    determined from the characteristics of a special diode with a
    tungsten filament as a function of time temperature and degree
    of vacuum the temperature dependence was also investigated for
    type and results presented graphically indicate that for work
    function measurements on metals a vacuum better than is
    required
