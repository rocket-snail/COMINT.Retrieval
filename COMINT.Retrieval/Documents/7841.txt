electron densities in the f region of the ionosphere from
    rocket measurements the recording and analysis of faraday
    rotation and range error measurements on radio waves from long
    range military and satellite launching rockets are described
    corrections for horizontal gradients and refraction are
    included the results from seven launchings show that the
    vertical electron density gradient is greatest near sunrise and
    lowest after sunset suggesting a time lag before diffusive
    equilibrium is reached
