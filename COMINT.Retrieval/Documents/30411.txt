effect of hydromagnetic waves on the lifetime of van
    allen radiation protons hydromagnetic waves with frequency less
    than and amplitude at two or three earth radii are capable of
    removing all high energy outer belt protons maximum energy in
    about day if an albedo neutron source is assumed for the inner
    belt protons the calculated proton flux as a function of radial
    distance from the earth agrees well with pioneer results
