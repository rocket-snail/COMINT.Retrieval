an electronic analogue multiplier using carriers an
    electronic analogue multiplier is described which is based on a
    modulation technique no dc amplifiers are used which makes the
    output entirely free of drifts all distortions up to the fourth
    order are eliminated the experimental model that has been built
    handles inputs from dc to and gives an output from dc to the
    amplitude range of the output is
