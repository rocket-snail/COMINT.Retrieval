the great info danger. presents, in the professor's own
    words, the gloomy prediction of professor joseph weizenbaum
    (computer science lecturer at massachusetts institute of
    technology) that an information catastrophe is ahead. he paints
    a picture of the blind (computer specialists) leading the blind
    (computer users) through a minefield of high technology which
    nobody understands and which has already shown that it is
    capable of the most fundamental errors. computer specialists do
    not understand modern computer systems and cannot predict how
    they will operate. they cannot, therefore, control them.
