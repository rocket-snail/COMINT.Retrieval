simultaneous pulled oscillations in a triode oscillator
    incorporating two oscillatory circuits simultaneous oscillation
    at two frequencies is possible and owing to mutual pulling both
    frequency and amplitude modulation occur a physical explanation
    of the pulling of a nonlinear oscillator by an external input
    signal is given
