the example of the 'marburg model'. critical summary of
    the progress made in introducing a coordinated library system
    at marburg university which was especially suited as a model
    for this purpose because the central alphabetical catalogue had
    been in existence since the 19th century and had been
    systematically extended since 1962; and new buildings for many
    of the library facilities have led to excellent lending
    conditions and close proximity between university buildings and
    library services. the coordination programme aims at, and has
    partially realised the integration of many small institute
    libraries into 28 library complexes with 52 independant library
    units. one important measure is the construction of a central
    medical library integrating the present 37 department
    libraries. it is possible to see that the programme initiated
    at marburg will lead to improved cooperation and integration in
    the library service and would be suitable for universities of a
    similar structure.
