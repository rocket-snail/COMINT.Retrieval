transistor amplifiers for use in a digital computer pulse
    regenerative amplifiers for a synchronous binary computer are
    based on use of external feedback so that a negative resistance
    transistor characteristic is not required by using semi gated
    feedback allowance can be made for the slow recovery of ge
    diodes incorporated in the circuit
