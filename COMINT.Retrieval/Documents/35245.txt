an electronic transformer the anode follower circuit is
    used as a transformer in a cable system where signals are
    distributed from a master generator to a number of separate
    displays the load on the source is negligible the voltage
    transformation is independent of the impedance transformation
    both being controllable the cable may be matched if necessary
    and the system bandwidth is inversely proportional to the cable
    length
