distributed amplifier theory matrix algebra is used to
    analyse operating conditions in the anode line the manner in
    which the amplifier gain depends on grid and anode line
    terminations and propagation constants number of valves and
    grid driving voltage is indicated experimental results obtained
    with a six valve amplifier provide general confirmation for the
    theory
