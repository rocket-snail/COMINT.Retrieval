frequency control and frequency fluctuations of the
    astable multivibrator a modified multivibrator circuit is given
    which permits frequency variation over the range by means of
    grid bias control the causes of fluctuations of pulse
    repetition frequency are investigated and design formulae are
    derived for minimizing these effects
