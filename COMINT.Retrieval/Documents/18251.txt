superconducting rectifier and amplifier to avoid heat
    losses due to heavy current leads in apparatus at liquid helium
    temperatures a high voltage ac supply is applied to a
    transformer which is coupled to the load through a coil of
    superconducting material by applying a magnetic field parallel
    to the axis of the coil a dc component is produced in the load
    a current amplification factor of is obtained at using coils of
    wire drawn from lead tin solder
