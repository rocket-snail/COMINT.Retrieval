the jena literary museum 1816-1919. the museum was
    administered by a group of members with literary and scientific
    interests who wished to obtain information on political and
    topical matters outside their work. the building up of a
    comprehensive periodical collection foreshadowed a modern
    trend. stocks were acquired through cooperative agreements
    with' the grand duke's library in weimar; jena university
    library, for which the museum became a reading-room until 1915;
    the weimar book museum; the carl zeiss foundation. many private
    members also donated their journals to the museum. when the
    public reading room opened in jena in 1896, reflecting the
    development of cultural and political thought, it flourished;
    the museum, in contrast, wished to remain the preserve of a
    well-educated, fee-paying minority and thus restricted its own
    development. ultimately the museum became part of the
    university library.
