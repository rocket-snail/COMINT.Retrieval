a low-cost system for producing machine-readable
    abstracts. describes geo systems' purpose built system centred
    on a word processor and designed to allow input from distant
    stations and output of both camera-ready copy and standard
    computer tapes for indexes and retrieval purposes. the emphasis
    is on a relatively cheap and simple system, and it is concluded
    that the total cost will add no more than 2.5% to the cost of
    each abstract.
