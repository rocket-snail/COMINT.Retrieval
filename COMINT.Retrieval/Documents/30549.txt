the katholiek literatuur centrum (catholic literature
    centre) in a historical movement. the catholic literature
    centre in the netherlands was created in 1971 from the
    katholiek bibliotheek en lectuur centrum (catholic library and
    literature centre). the kblc itself was formed in 1968 by the
    fusion of several older organisations, including the bond van
    rooms-katholieke openbare leeszalen en boekerijen (association
    of roman catholic public reading rooms and libraries) and the
    katholieke centrale vereniging voor lectuurvoorziening
    (catholic central society for literature provision). as an
    extraordinary member of the nederlands bibliotheek en lektuur
    centrum (dutch centre for libraries and literature) the centre
    aims to represent the interests of the catholic church in
    public library affairs and is especially concerned to promote
    the interests of christian organisations, such as the
    interdenominational peace council, pax christi and the central
    commission for missionary work through public lib
    raries.
