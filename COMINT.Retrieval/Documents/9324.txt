proposed molecular amplifier and coherent generator for
    millimetre and submillimetre waves the difficulties of
    obtaining maser action increase with frequency owing to the
    increasing number of energy sublevels and to decreasing
    sensitivity of molecules to field gradients a proposed method
    of avoiding these difficulties is to use special types of
    stimulated emitter and to separate molecules with different
    energy levels by a combination of inhomogeneous and homogeneous
    fields respectively outside and inside the cell
