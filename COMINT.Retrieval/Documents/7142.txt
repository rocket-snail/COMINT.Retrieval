subject libraries in the german democratic republic's
    library association as exemplified by technical libraries. the
    associations' sections are composed of specialised subject and
    academic general libraries with relevant stocks in the subject
    area concerned. they aim to develop cooperation, the optimal
    use of literature, education and exchange of professional
    experiences. the technical section is the largest, with 318
    members. technical libraries stock mainly modern material;
    their staff members are few, their opening hours are restricted
    and their research results are often inaccessible to the
    general public. they are closely connected with a scientific
    discipline and provide specific information sources which play
    subordinate roles in other libraries. the technical library
    section is currently concerned with library and information
    work in factory combines, problems of patent literature and
    library work in technical colleges within industrial
    complexes.
