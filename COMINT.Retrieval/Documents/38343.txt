an approach toward functional text structure analysis of
    scientific and technical documents. a structural analysis of
    texts is presented as a part of a semantic method for
    representing scientific and technical documents. 4 concepts of
    theme, method, result and discussion are selected and a model
    set of 'functional patterns' consisting of meta-terms in each
    sentence of the abstract is prepared. a preliminary computer
    experiment produced a pattern matching procedure identifying
    the information function for each sentence of the abstract
    based on the model set. the results are examined and discussed
    in terms of reproducibility of the model set and effectiveness
    of the procedure for the other data sets.
