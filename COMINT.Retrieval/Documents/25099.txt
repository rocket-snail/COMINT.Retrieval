a comparison of the intensities of cosmic noise observed
    at and at the principal conclusion of this comparison is that
    the background radiation cannot be made up of the radiation
    from sources of the type observed so far although a small polar
    component may be due to the extragalactic sources absorption in
    interstellar gas has a considerable effect on the intensity
    variations of background radiation with direction observed
