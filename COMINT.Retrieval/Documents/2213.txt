the parameters of a four terminal network the method of
    analysing quadripoles in terms of image impedances and a
    propagation constant is compared with the method based on the
    general circuit constants the latter method which can
    conveniently be treated by matrix algebra as described by
    guertler of is preferred the relation between the two sets of
    constants is examined and typical applications are
    illustrated
