a directed independent study approach to a foundations
    course. over the past decade the graduate school of library and
    information science, university of illinois, has tried several
    approaches to presenting the 'fundamentals' of librarianship to
    students. in its present form, the 'directed independent study'
    approach, the fundamentals course consists of a series of
    modules. for each module the student receives a minitext, a set
    of readings and a workbook. the student must study the text and
    readings and complete the workbook assignments related to this
    module. the student passes the course when all component
    modules are completed to the satisfaction of the student's
    faculty advisor. discusses the reasons for abandoning the
    earlier methods, the evolution of the present format and its
    advantages and limitations.
