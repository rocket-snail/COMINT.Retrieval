cosmic rays in the earths magnetic field discrepancies
    between centre dipole predictions using the stormer equation
    and experimental observations of cosmic ray intensities and cut
    off phenomena are attributed to differences between the earths
    real field and the dipole approximation to it rather than to
    distortion of the earths outer magnetic field by ionized
    interplanetary matter an empirical expression for the cut off
    phenomena is deduced which is in good agreement with
    experimental results over a wide range of latitude and
    longitude
