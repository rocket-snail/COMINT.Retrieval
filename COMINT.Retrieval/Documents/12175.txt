radiation emitted by a uniformly moving electron in
    electron plasma in a magnetic field results of the theoretical
    considerations presented indicate that cerenkov type radiation
    may be produced by charged particles not necessarily moving at
    relativistic speeds cosmic particles in the ionosphere the
    frequencies of the radiated ordinary waves lie in the range
    where is the plasma angular frequency that of extraordinary
    waves in the range where is the gyrofrequency extraordinary
    waves only are produced in weak magnetic fields and by
    relativistic electrons
