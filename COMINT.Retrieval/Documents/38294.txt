the provision of medical information in smaller hospitals
    in the netherlands. in the netherlands the provision of library
    services in hospitals with less than 100 beds is seriously
    inadequate. a survey of smaller hospitals in the us in 1975
    showed that 1/3 of hospitals surveyed had some form of library.
    the provision of library services in dutch hospitals is
    hindered by inadequate bookfunds, staff and accommodation.
    furthermore, in the smaller hospitals doctors are too busy with
    routine work to use library services. smaller hospitals could
    provide medical 'core' libraries of basic textbooks and
    periodicals at minimal cost. such a medical core library was
    formed in 1973 at the princess irene hospital in almelo and by
    1979 the library contained 266 books and 6 periodical
    titles.
