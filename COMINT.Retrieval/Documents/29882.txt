modern aspects of information communication in education.
    presents a model of an information communication system in
    education consisting of 2 subsystems' (a) the subsystem of
    didactic information processing and the results of the national
    and international research work in the area of education; and
    (b) the subsystem of numerical data (data banks) as a national
    information system for managing staff in education, which
    specifically provides statistical data concerning the progress
    of this activity. a description of the information flow within
    the 2 subsystems is made and several evaluation criteria of the
    overall system efficiency are given.
