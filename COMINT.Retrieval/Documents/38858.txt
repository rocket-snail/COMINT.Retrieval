the effect of the solar tides and the temperature change
    on the daily variation in electron density and height of the f
    layer the departure of the maximum electron density from the
    norm of a static chapman region is inversely proportional to
    the temperature variation except in the morning when the
    electron density is small the semidiurnal variation in appears
    even in the case when account is taken of the diurnal
    temperature variation only as regards the departure from the
    norm of the height of the result is similar to that obtained by
    weiss of except that it is more strongly temperature dependent
    there is some interaction between the temperature and the tidal
    effects
