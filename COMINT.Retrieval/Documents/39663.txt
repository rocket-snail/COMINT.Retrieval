a problem situation and ways of overcoming it. at present
    97% of soviet families possess home libraries, and 70% of the
    population reads for 1 hour daily. consequently traditional
    editions of 200,000 to 500,000 copies fail to satisfy demand.
    interlibrary loans and providing libraries with supplementary
    copies of popular books could furnish better satisfaction.
    booksellers, librarians and library-users should help to
    determine size of editions. the media, readers and librarians
    should persuade the public that reading books is more important
    than collecting them. information used once only could appear
    in 'telejournals'. some publishers should produce
    multi-million, moderately priced editions of classic and modern
    literature for home use, while others provided large
    stoutly-bound editions for public libraries. booksellers,
    publishers, librarians and readers should join to discuss these
    questions.
