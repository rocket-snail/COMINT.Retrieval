a theory of radar scattering by the moon a detailed
    discussion of available experimental evidence leads to the
    theory that the scattering is composed of a number of
    individual returns from twenth thirty single scattering areas
    with those nearest to the earth providing a specular return
    information about the material of which this area is composed
    can then be obtained
