on the electrodes of gt cut crystal units used for the
    frequency standards the physical properties and method of
    fabrication of electrodes for crystals used in primary
    frequency standards are described a maximum q is obtained when
    the gold sputtered electrode has a thickness of advantages of
    annealing are discussed
