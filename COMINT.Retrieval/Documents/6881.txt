a nonlinear low frequency instability phenomenon in audio
    amplifiers under certain conditions af amplifiers with feedback
    may show instability at low frequencies which is not
    predictable by conventional linear analysis the problem is
    analyzed theoretically with supporting experimental results and
    a technique given for reducing the nonlinear effect
