an investigation of the nonlinear distortion of a
    quadripole using a continuous spectrum signal fo measuring the
    nonlinear distortion introduced by an af transmission system it
    is necessary to use a continuous spectrum of frequencies with a
    given shape of the envelope relations are derived from which it
    is possible to calculate the spectra at the output of certain
    nonlinear systems for input signals covering a continuous band
    of frequencies and having envelopes represented by an
    exponential function or a difference between two exponential
    functions as compared with tests using one or two spot
    frequencies the results so obtained are more in accordance with
    results of subjective listening tests
