user education for an online catalog' a workshop
    approach. for more than 6 years, the ohio state university
    libraries have had public terminals available for searching
    their library control system (lcs), a former circulation system
    that is evolving into an on-line catalogue. patron instruction
    in use of the system has expanded in parallel with the
    evolution of lcs, moving from informal printed instructions to
    a standardised 1 hour workshop. a year of experience has shown
    the workshop to be a valuable part of the libraries'
    user-education programme and a particularly suitable approach
    for on-line catalogue instruction.
