calculated diffraction patterns of dielectric rods at
    centimetric wavelengths calculations of the field behind the
    cylinder are made for the case of a normally incident wave with
    the electric vector parallel and perpendicular to the cylinder
    axis the dielectric materials considered include polystyrene
    lucite and tenite the diffraction pattern is only slightly
    dependent on the dielectric constant of the rod small
    discrepancies between the calculated values and values obtained
    experimentally of are probably due to resistive loss in the
    dielectric
