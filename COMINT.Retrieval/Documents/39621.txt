wake up, holger danske (and lise ostergaard). discusses
    the production of a danish encyclopaedia. the publishers,
    gyldendal, hoped to produce an updated version of the esteemed
    salmonsen, but the project proved too expensive and a less
    ambitious 10 volume work has now been published. a similar lack
    of a substantial national encyclopaedia led in sweden to the
    appointment of a committee by the ministry of education, whose
    report is discussed here. it analyses all problems surrounding
    the publication of encyclopaedias and concludes that such
    publication can today only by undertaken with state support. it
    stresses the need for a large encyclopaedia for the acquisition
    of background information. use will be mainly in connection
    with education, in administration and industry, and will be
    central in library reference sections. guidelines for the
    cooperation between publishers and the state are drawn up, and
    a publishing timetable of at most 10 years with updating every
    10 years is suggested. pub lication as teledata or on video
    discs is rejected.
