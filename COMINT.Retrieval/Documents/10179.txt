design of coaxial cavities for valves with planar
    electrodes the cavities form the double coaxial line structure
    used in conjunction with a disk seal type valve for grounded
    grid operation as amplifier or multiplier a graphical method of
    design is presented which involves only functions of the
    characteristic impedance once the operating mode has been
    chosen criteria are explained for determining the diameters of
    the two cavities for optimum response for higher mode operation
    the response can be improved most easily by the introduction of
    a suitable discontinuity three types are considered the
    occurrence of spurious resonances is also discussed
