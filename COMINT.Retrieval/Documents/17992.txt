serial cost efficiency-a model and case study (in
    hebrew). high rate inflation in periodical subscription prices
    without adequate budget increments force many libraries to
    freeze new subscriptions and in many cases to cancel
    subscriptions. the process of deselection raises the question
    of which titles will be retained and which will be
    discontinued. suggests that the evaluation of the relative
    importance of the various titles will be done by using a cost
    efficiency formula. the formula combines 2 factors, the price
    of subscription and the measured use of the journal, and ranks
    periodicals in a given collection in a descending order' at the
    top will be the most cost-efficient title and at the bottom the
    least cost-efficient title. this formula was tried in
    conjunction with a use study of the judaica reading room's ohio
    state university libraries during 1978.
