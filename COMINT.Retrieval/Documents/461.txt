a radio survey of the galactic plane at a frequency of
    parts of discrete sources observed most lie within of the
    galactic plane and about are thermal continuum observations
    show large scale features which can be interpreted in terms of
    a spiral model of the galaxy if independent distributions for
    thermal and nonthermal emission are postulated
