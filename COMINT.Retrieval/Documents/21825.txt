frequency multiplication by regenerative modulation a
    multiple frequency generator is discussed in which operation
    depends on mixing a feedback and an input voltage theory is
    presented for a circuit designed to produce four multiples of
    the input frequency experimental confirmation of the results is
    reported multiples up to the have been obtained with good
    amplitudes maximum amplitudes can be arranged to fall in
    desired frequency ranges even and odd multiples can be made
    available at separate output terminals operation is unaffected
    by variations of anode filament or input voltage or by phase
    shifts due to aging of components in the feedback loop
