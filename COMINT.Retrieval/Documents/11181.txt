a consideration of the electron disappearance in the
    layer of the ionosphere factors influencing the electron
    concentration and conventional theories of recombination and
    attachment are reviewed nocturnal diffusion can account for
    only a small variation of concentration but its effect on the
    altitude of maximum concentration is not necessarily negligible
    statistical analysis indicates that the influence of pressure
    on the nocturnal variation of electron concentration is
    unexpectedly small while that of temperature is large analysis
    of the monthly mean values indicates that attachment rather
    than recombination is the mechanism responsible for the
    electron disappearance the influence of layer movements though
    not large is significant further evidence in favour of the
    attachment theory is obtained from consideration of
    distribution and from a comparison of the nocturnal
    concentration variations at two sites theoretical
    considerations favour a process of electron removal in which
    collisions between atomic ions of oxygen and excited molecules
    of nitrogen produce molecular ions of nitrogen which in turn
    recombine with electrons
