problems in the simulation of bibliographic retrieval
    systems. presents a formal probabilistic logical model of a
    bibliographic retrieval system which can be used as a basis for
    the computer simulation of information retrieval from a
    bibliographic data base. describes a specific implementation of
    the model and assess how well the implementation was able to
    simulate the cranfield ii and medlars retrieval test
    collections at cornell university's computer science
