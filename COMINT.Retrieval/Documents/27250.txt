ionospheric behaviour at khartoum during the eclipse of
    february observations indicate that the e and f layers behave
    as chapman layers having constant effective recombination
    coefficients of and respectively assuming a nonuniform
    distribution of the sources of ionizing radiation on the suns
    disk the positions and relative intensities of these sources
    and the frequency of the radiation are indicated the f layer
    records suggest the existence at the time of the eclipse of two
    component layers a lower one corresponding to the normal post
    sunrise f layer having a high and an upper one which is a later
    development of the lower having a low changes in d layer
    absorption confirm the asymmetrical distribution of sources of
    ionizing radiation there is no evidence of an eclipse effect on
    e ionization nor for a corpuscular eclipse in the f
    layer
