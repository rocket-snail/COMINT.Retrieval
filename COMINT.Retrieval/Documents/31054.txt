orbital acceleration of satellites during geomagnetic
    disturbance approximate analysis d is developed to show that
    joule heating of the lower reaches of the ionosphere by
    geomagnetic currents is a major factor in the modulation of
    thermospheric densities which causes fluctuations in the
