turkish children and teenagers as library users.
    librarians know little about the views of foreign workers and
    their families on libraries; many of these people understand
    little german. in july 80 munich municipal library produced a
    questionnaire for turkish children, including questions on age,
    sex, schools and types of class, length of time in germany,
    ability to read german, library use and likes and dislikes
    concerning books, cassettes and library facilities. language
    problems led to some misunderstandings; the design of future
    questionnaires must be improved. results showed that the
    average reader is 10-13 years old, male, in a turkish class at
    school and can read some german books. he came to germany
    within the last 4 years, learnt about the library from friends,
    has a reader's ticket and visits the library at least once a
    week.
