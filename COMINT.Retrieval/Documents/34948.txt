an electromagnetic diffraction problem involving
    unidirectionally conducting surfaces the exact value of the em
    field scattered by a undirectionally conducting surface under
    plane wave excitation is obtained the surface which is an
    entire plane is the junction of two unidirectionally conducting
    half planes whose conductivity directions are inclined at an
    arbitrary angle to each other and to the boundary line
