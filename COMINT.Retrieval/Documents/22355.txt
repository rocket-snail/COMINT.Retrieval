archives and libraries. following a 1979 study tour
    covering 6 local history archives in denmark, relationships,
    joint functions and finance of such archives and local history
    collections are discussed. the 1st local history archive in
    denmark was established in faborg in 1937; by 1979 there were
    about 240. a 1978 report defined material belonging
    respectively to local history collections and local history
    archives, recommending coordination by the library but
    considerable autonomy for the archives. while details differ,
    cooperation seems generally satisfactory. financial
    arrangements vary widely, still with many voluntary archivists.
    with no comparable activity in norway, it seems necessary to
    survey existing resources and institutions and evaluate the
    situation. priorities are collection, arrangement and indexing,
    conservation, and availability. public libraries, though the
    natural home for local history archives, would require
    additional finance and staffing. local organisations should be
    approached, manpower and resources coordinated, and help sought
    from regional and central authorities.
