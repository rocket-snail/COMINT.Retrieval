indispensible considerations in automating library
    techniques. libraries, despite their tradition-minded
    reputation, always were sensible about the technical aspects of
    their duties and open to innovations. consequently the
    application of computer techniques here is discussed. these
    systems usually are not developed on unique principles for
    library purposes, but have been adapted from principles already
    existing in other applications. some of these principles are
    more apt for application in libraries than others regarding the
    special duties of libraries towards their users. this fact
    today seems to be slightly underrated when libraries decide
    about the acquisition of an automated system.
