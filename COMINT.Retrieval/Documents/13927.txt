john harris' nz's gift to nigerian library education. new
    zealander john harris (1903-80) arrived in nigeria in 1948 to
    be librarian of the fledgeling university college, ibadan. he
    almost single-handedly created nigeria's premier academic press
    and, with his wife, its 1st university bookshop. he played a
    major role in forming the west african library association and
    initiated the 1st formal library education course in nigeria.
    thanks largely to him, the 1st library school in nigeria, the
    institute of librarianship, was established in 1959 with a
    grant from the carnegie corporation-this in the face of
    competition from other west african states wishing to establish
    such a body.
