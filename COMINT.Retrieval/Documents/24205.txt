observation of the costa ribeiro effect on the
    dissolution of naphthalene crystals report of experiments
    indicating that electric charges are developed on dissolving
    single crystals of naphthalene in a solvent of very low
    conductivity such as toluene the crystals thus treated
    constitute natural electrets
