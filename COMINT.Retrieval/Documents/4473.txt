microwave technique for studying discharges in gases
    experiments were made with a neon filled tube inserted through
    a pancake waveguide internal height mm the variation of the
    discharge dc due to the rf field being observed on a cro for
    various relative positions of tube and guide the frequency used
    was about and the rf power
