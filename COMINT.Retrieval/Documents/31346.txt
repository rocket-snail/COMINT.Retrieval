the second order effect of free electrons on lattice
    conduction second order perturbation theory in conjunction with
    the usual treatment of electron phonon interaction allows us to
    calculate the correction to the first order result for the
    scattering of phonons by electrons it is shown that the second
    order term is much smaller and therefore negligible this
    justifies the use of the first order theory in the treatment of
    the interaction in metals and semiconductors
