the union of the muses. ust'-ilimsk began an experiment
    in creating aesthetic education centres, (aec), in 30 schools
    in 1978. at these aec, children played, heard music, read,
    looked at pictures in a 3-year aesthetic education programme,
    involving meeting artists, musicians, and children's librarians
    after school. the 1st year comprised' musical education, art,
    library and bibliographic knowledge. the 2nd year included'
    russian folk art, where the children compiled stories, learnt
    about folk festivals and dances, drew their favourite heroes.
    in the experimental classes children learn well, are more
    confident in class, more organised and have a richer
    vocabulary. all are library readers. results show the need to
    introduce this programme to 1st-formers in all ust'-ilimsk
    schools.
