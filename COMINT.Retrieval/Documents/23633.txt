limitations and possibilities for improvement of
    photovoltaic solar energy converters part one considerations
    for earths surface operation the possibilities of improving the
    performance of the single si solar cell are considered as these
    are limited the use of other materials and the development of a
    multilayer and a multiple transition cell are examined and
    found to give larger theoretical efficiencies
