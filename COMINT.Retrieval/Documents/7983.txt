principles for preserving and restoring library
    collections. the principles for the preservation and
    restoration of library collections are set out by the members
    of the standing committee of ifla's preservation section. the
    aim of the principles is to increase library staff's awareness
    of the necessity of preserving and restoring not only archive
    material but also contemporary literature collections. the most
    important principle is that of suitable storage facilities.
    most common forms of damage occur through unstable climatic
    conditions, incorrect lighting, dust, biological causes
    (micro-organisms and insects) and chemical causes (oxidation
    and hydrolysis of the cellulose). to protect original material,
    copies should be lent to the user whenever possible.
    restoration should only be carried out when it is unavoidable.
    every step of the restoration process should be documented as
    librarians should realise that even expert restoration can lead
    to falsification and distortion of the original .
