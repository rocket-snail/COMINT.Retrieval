long range budget planning in large public libraries.
    argues that if a large public library makes a practice of
    gathering information on which to build budget requests, the
    time consuming data gathering can be reduced in subsequent
    years by examining the overall requested growth rate for the
    system and adjusting the figures where needed to bring it in
    line with what is feasible. the adjusted figures can then be
    returned to the requesting librarians for them to see what can
    be expected as a request. demonstrates how, in times when funds
    are scarce, this practice will act as an informational and
    decision-making tool and will serve to adjust library needs to
    zero-base budgeting practices.
