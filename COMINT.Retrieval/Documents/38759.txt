wide band absorbers for electromagnetic waves the
    construction is described of shaft type absorbers suitable for
    metre waves measurements of reflection coefficient as a
    function of frequency and angle of incidence are discussed and
    the possibilities of reducing the depth of the absorber and of
    extending the absorption range to lower frequencies are
    mentioned
