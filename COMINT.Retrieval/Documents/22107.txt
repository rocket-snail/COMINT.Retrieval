rejection factor of difference amplifiers analysis shows
    that the rejection factor of a differential amplifier can be
    made arbitrarily large without necessitating pre selection of
    valves or exact equality of the two halves of the circuit the
    theory is supported by experimental results the parameter
    termed rejection factor is the same as that termed transmission
    factor by parnum
