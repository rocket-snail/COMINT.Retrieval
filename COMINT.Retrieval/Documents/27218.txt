the development of the library profession as a profession
    for women. surveys the social background, the historical
    background up to the 1920s, the qualifications and personal
    characteristics required of women in librarianship, as well as
    their part in library associations. women first became accepted
    in librarianship when there were insufficient numbers of men
    available. the women, mostly from the middle class, rushed into
    a profession which did not detract from social prestige.
    stereotyped ideas concerning female qualities made their
    entrance into the profession easier' accuracy, industry,
    self-denial and subordination on the one hand; social
    sensitivity, motherly feeling and insight into people's nature
    on the other. the growing number of women in librarianship made
    an organ for the representation of their interests desirable.
    the 'vereinigung bibliotekarisch arbeitender frauen', founded
    in 1907, made efforts to improve payment, inform interested
    people about the profession and about ed ucation for
    librarianship, and provided an employment agency. the
    association was dissolved into the 'reichsverband deutscher
    bibliotheksbeamter und-angestellter' in 1920.
