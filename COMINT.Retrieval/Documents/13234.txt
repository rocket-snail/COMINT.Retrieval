the magnetic fields of a ferrite ellipsoid approximate
    expressions are found for the internal and the adjacent
    external magnetic fields of a small ferrite ellipsoid under
    plane wave excitation consideration is given to the variation
    of apparent susceptibility with the size of the ferrite
