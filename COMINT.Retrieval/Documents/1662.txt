absorption of electromagnetic waves by means of lossy
    resonant slots very thin microwave absorbers can be constructed
    by using a sheet of resistive with tuned slots at a distance in
    front of a metal plate the bandwidth can be increased by the
    insertion of a grid of dipoles and the effects of polarization
    are minimized if circular slots are used see also of
