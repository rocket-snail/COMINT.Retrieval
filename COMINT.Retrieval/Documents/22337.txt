ionospheric absorption measurements during a sunspot
    cycle detailed discussion of the results of the results of
    measurements referred to in of variation of atmospheric
    absorption with frequency where is the effective ionospheric
    reflection coefficient is accounted for by magneto ionic theory
    provided that where is the electron collision frequency and is
    the gyrofrequency corresponding to the vertical component of
    the geomagnetic field examination of diurnal variation shows
    the average value of n in the relation where is the solar
    zenith distance to be against the value given by simple theory
    possible explanations of this are considered excessive
    absorption on certain groups of days during th months november
    february is directly correlated with the occurrence of sporadic
    reflecting strata below e layer height noon measurements over
    years show a general correlation of log with sunspot number r
    more pronounced in summer than in winter general conclusions
    drawn are that the normal absorbing stratum is located in the d
    region and sudden disturbances associated with solar flares are
    probably due to increased ionization in this layer
