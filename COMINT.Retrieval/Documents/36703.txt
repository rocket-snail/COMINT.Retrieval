perpendicularly superposed magnetic fields digest of a
    paper to be published in theory is outlined for a cross field
    reactor comprising a hollow ferrite toroid carrying one annular
    winding internally and one toroidal winding externally the
    device can be used as an low level converter or modulator as a
    variable inductance or as a frequency multiplier of
    divider
