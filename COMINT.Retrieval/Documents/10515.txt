the effect of temperature and acoustic impedance of
    vapours on the electrical constants of quartz measurements were
    made of the equivalent resistance of a crystal vibrating in
    vapours of various organic liquids at a given temperature the
    equivalent resistance depends on the pressure as the
    temperature increases the equivalent resistance decreases the
    rate of decrease depending on the particular vapour
