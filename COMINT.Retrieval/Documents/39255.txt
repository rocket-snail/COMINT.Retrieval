growth of electromagnetic waves in interpenetrating
    infinite moving media phenomenological treatment of the
    propagation of plane monochromatic waves in mutually
    interpenetrating media equations are derived for the refractive
    index and are applied to the problem of stability build up and
    damping factors are determined for the case of a plasma moving
    through a dispersionless dielectric
