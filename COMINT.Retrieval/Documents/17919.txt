intensity and polarization of electromagnetic waves
    diffracted at a slit part diffraction of electromagnetic waves
    at a slit is investigated under the supposition that the
    electric field vector is perpendicular to the slit edges
    magnetic case this supplements the investigation of the same
    problem for the case where the electric field vector is
    parallel to the slit edges electric case of and the combination
    of both cases makes it possible to calculate the intensity and
    polarization of the wave field for incident polarized and
    unpolarized radiation in the case of very narrow slits to which
    the fresnel kirchhoff theory is no longer applicable the
    electric component normal to the slit edges is determinative
    for the diffracted field
