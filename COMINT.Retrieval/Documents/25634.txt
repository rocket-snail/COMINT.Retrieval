secondary emission valve pulse generator with cathode
    output a positive feedback circuit giving a very low output
    impedance is used capable of producing pulses of amplitude with
    rise time about by using a pentode as cathode load it is
    possible to obtain a wide variety of pulse waveforms the
    arrangement gives a better performance than the ordinary
    blocking oscillator
