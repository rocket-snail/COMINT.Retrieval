the effects of metainformation cost change on information
    and metainformation preference in a decision task. (phd
    dissertation-syracuse university.) hypothesises that cost
    changes have an effect on predecision information and
    metainformation (information on information) preferences.
    reviews the treatment of cost effects on information use in the
    decision literature, and tests the hypotheses that' the order
    of the cost conditions affects the preferences, that an
    interaction effect exists between cost and sequence, and that
    if cost has an effect on preferences, then metainformation
    preferences will vary inversely with cost.
