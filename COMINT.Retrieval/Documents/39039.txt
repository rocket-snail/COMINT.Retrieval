the stability of the interface between the solar wind ad
    the geomagnetic field surface magnetometer data are presented
    as evidence of the stability of the interface between the solar
    wind and the geomagnetic field hydromagnetic waves are assumed
    to be generated by fluctuations in the energy density of the
    solar wind rather than by turbulence or gross instability at
    the interface
