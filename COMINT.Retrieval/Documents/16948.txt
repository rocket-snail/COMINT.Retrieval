oslo and its most important libraries. oslo, with 456,000
    inhabitants, enjoys a public library service from 2 main
    centres-the university library (ubo) and the deichmanske
    biblioteket. the ubo serves both as a university and national
    library, thereby creating a series of difficulties in the
    structural organisation of the service. bibliographic work has
    been facilitated by the use of computers, and national and
    international bibliographies are in process. the public has a
    single alphabetical author and subject catalogue, and
    bureaucratic formalities have been reduced to a minimum. the
    deichmanske is distinguished from other scandinavian libraries
    by its widespread service to schools and educational
    institutes. it aims to procure and lend books unobtainable from
    other sources. both libraries leave the impression of an
    efficient service which has eliminated all sources of
    discouragement to users.
