no grandfather clause: reappraising accessioned records.
    every public records repository has on its shelves records
    which, if offered today, would be unacceptable, and yet shelf
    space is still provided for them. for such records there should
    be no 'grandfather clause'. discusses the reasons for the
    keeping of records of questionable value, and suggests a
    reappraisal procedure, with an interval of reappraisal of
    perhaps 20 to 30 years. discusses appraisal methods, stressing
    the care that must be taken if unique and important records are
    not to be destroyed.
