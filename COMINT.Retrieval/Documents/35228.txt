electromagnetic radiation from lightning strokes a theory
    is given of the spectral distribution and the amount of vlf
    radiation emitted from a vertical lightning stroke from cloud
    to ground the radiated energy has a maximum intensity at about
    and a total width at half maximum of the total energy radiated
    in one leader and return stroke is estimated to be about
    joules
