on a special aspect of the condensation process and its
    importance in the treatment of cloud particle growth the
    distribution of water vapour around a droplet depends upon the
    ratio of droplet size to a factor determined by the equilibrium
    rate of exchange of molecules between the water surface and the
    water vapour
