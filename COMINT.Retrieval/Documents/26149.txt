new phase and frequency comparison circuits a method is
    described for producing a rectified voltage which is a function
    of the phase and frequency difference of two alternating
    voltages it is particularly suitable for pulse shaped waveforms
    and its application for synchronizing systems in television
    receivers is examined in detail
