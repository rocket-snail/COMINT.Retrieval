    of the public catalogues; (2) to calculate the ratio between
    use of the card catalogue and the separate serials catalogue,
    (3) to compare the library staff's use of the catalogue with
    use by the public; and (4) to obtain information about use of
    the card catalogue and the serials catalogue in each of several
