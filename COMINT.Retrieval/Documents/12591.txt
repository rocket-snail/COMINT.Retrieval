twisted magnetic fields in conducting fluids the
    formation of loops in the lines of force of a twisted magnetic
    field confined within a cylinder of radius r is discussed by
    the method of normal modes the condition obtained for loop
    formation is that the pitch of the twisted field be less than r
    the velocity of alfven waves in this model is also
    discussed
