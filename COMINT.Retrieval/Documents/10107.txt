research enhancement by heuristic information. after a
    review of heuristics and heuristic information some aspects of
    mission oriented information are dealt with from the
    librarian's viewpoint. information staff should be aware that
    relevant information may be located by searching fields other
    than the user's speciality. in addition to the traditional
    sources, an interdisciplinary approach assists in the
    exploitation of such materials as reports in methodological
    surveys, research reports and dissertations. sociological
    information can be of heuristic value in epidemiological
    research. however, heuristic information will be serviceable
    only if the librarian is familiar with the scientist's aims and
    field of research.
