movement of auroral echoes and the magnetic disturbance
    current system a brief review of the findings of other
    investigators and a report of observations made at invercargill
    new zealand on a preliminary analysis indicates that the
    ionization giving rise to vhf radar echoes occurs in the most
    intense portion of the disturbance current system and that the
    observed movements of electrons can account for the magnitude
    of the disturbance vector
