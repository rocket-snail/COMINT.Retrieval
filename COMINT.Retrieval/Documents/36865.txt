a new method of analysing ionospheric movement records
    technique based on optical diffraction systems is outlined the
    ionosphere is provisionally assumed to be a plane reflector and
    the image of a ground transmitter in it is regarded as a source
    of coherent radiation giving rise to a diffraction pattern on
    the ground corresponding to an inhomogeneity moving in or below
    the ionosphere from the geometry of the system a focal length
    is deduced and when the record of the diffraction pattern is
    converted into a variable density photographic record a
    corresponding visual focal length is obtained from which the
    velocity of the moving inhomogeneity can be determined the
    method has been tried at the new zealand dominion physical
    laboratory using aerials arranged at the corners of a triangle
    as suggested by mitra holograms showing some results are
    reproduced from these it is celar that moving objects far below
    the ionosphere can affect the records significantly
