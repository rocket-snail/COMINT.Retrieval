theory of equations of transport in strong electric
    fields the transport of heat and electricity in semiconductors
    is considered in terms of an electron hole gas whose kinetic
    energy is greatly increased in a strong electric field
    equations for the thermal and electric currents are derived and
    formulae are obtained for the thermoelectric and
    galvanomagnetic effects these include the thomson hall nernst
    and nerst ettinghausen effects effects due to bipolar
    conduction of the semiconductor including the photomagnetic
    effect are also considered
