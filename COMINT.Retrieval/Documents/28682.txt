a model of a document-clustering-based information
    retrieval system with a boolean search request formulation.
    presents an information retrieval method which clusters
    documents on the basis of previously determined clusters of
    boolean search request formulations. suggests ways of selecting
    these formulations and discusses the influence of selection
    method on retrieval effectiveness. special attention is paid to
    the method which provides retrieval effectiveness comparable to
    that obtained with a sequential file. theoretical
    considerations are illustrated by a numerical example.
