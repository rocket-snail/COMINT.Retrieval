dramatic rise in the number of censorship cases.
    interviews judith f. krug, leader of the american library
    association's office for intellectual freedom. its work is
    based on the first amendment of the u.s. constitution and on
    the ala's library bill of rights. it began as the intellectual
    freedom committee in 1940. until recently almost all cases came
    from school libraries, but since the reagan administration took
    office the most important cases originate with the public
    libraries. the office, however, does not confine itself to
    taking up cases within the library sector, but it keeps
    librarians and the public informed of the importance of the
    first amendment, issues publications, and holds seminars. many
    attempts at censorship come from the moral majority movement.
    the office finds it easier to deal with libraries which have a
    clearly formulated selection policy, and in very few cases does
    it recommend refusal to acquire a particular book. the legal
    side of ala is dealt with by a separate, but related body, the
    freedom to read foundation.
