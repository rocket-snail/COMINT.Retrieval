nitrogen in the upper atmosphere the probable
    distribution of atomic n is investigated theoretically the
    method of calculation adopted is a modification of that used by
    penndorf in investigating the dissociation of oxygen of within
    the height range km the predissociation mechanism suggested by
    herzberg and herzberg operates while in the range a
    dissociative recombination suggested by mitra is effective in
    the lower region there is a sharp maximum in the distribution
    curve at about km in the upper region the concentration
    increases monotonically with height the total number of n atoms
    in a vertical column of cross section is calculated to be
    about
