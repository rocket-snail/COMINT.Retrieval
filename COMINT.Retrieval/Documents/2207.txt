rectifier with smoothing capacitor and high vacuum valves
    or selenium rectifiers exact equations are derived for a p
    phase rectifier circuit with a capacitance connected across the
    load for practical use approximate formulae are derived and
    their application is illustrated by the design of a two phase
    rectifier for an output of
