high power audio amplifiers recent applications for a f
    power up to include vibration work servomechanism studies
    pulsed service and variable frequency power sources all of
    which require response distortion and noise level
    characteristics similar to those for broadcasting service in
    high power amplifiers with class b push pull output the output
    transformer is the largest and most expensive item in the
    equipment and may weigh some hundreds of pounds a new
    equivalent circuit is used in the design of such transformers
    harmonic distortion caused by the transformer is analysed and
    methods of improving the performance of class b power
    amplifiers are described a few details are given of a amplifier
    with a response curve flat to within from to
