nonlinear distortion and stability of reflex circuits two
    single valve and three two valve crystal detector reflex
    amplifier circuits are discussed the coefficient of non linear
    distortion is calculated for the various circuits and the
    results are plotted as a function of the parameter the relative
    change of slope of the curve from the value at the working
    point due to the applied signal can theoretically be made zero
    by using a pair of identical valves in the circuit shown in the
    stability criteria are also discussed
