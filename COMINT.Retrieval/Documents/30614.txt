space charge wave amplification in a shock front and the
    fin structure of solar radio noise the dispersion equation
    corresponding to the non maxwellian velocity distribution of
    the particles in a shock front is derived the roots indicate
    frequency bandwidths of space charge wave amplification
    decreasing with the shock strength it is suggested in agreement
    with cenisse and rocard of that the storm bursts of narrow
    bandwidth originating in shock fronts constitute the elementary
    fine structure components of solar radio noise bursts
