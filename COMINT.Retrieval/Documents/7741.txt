a phase shifting pulse generator for thyratron control
    description with detailed circuit diagram of equipment
    producing positive pulses with repetition frequency that of the
    mains but with phase variable with respect to that of the
    supply voltage the phase lag is controlled by application of a
    small direct voltage to the grid of a high vacuum valve
