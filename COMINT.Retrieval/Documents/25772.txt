a translating computer interface for end-user operation
    of heterogeneous retrieval systems. 2. evaluations. the
    evaluation of the concept of a translating computer interface
    for simplifying operation of multiple, heterogeneous on-line
    bibliographic retrieval systems has been undertaken. an
    experimental retrieval system, named conit, was built and
    tested under controlled conditions with inexperienced end
    users. a detailed analysis of the experimental usages showed
    that users were able to master interface operation sufficiently
    well to find relevant document references. success was
    attributed, in part, to a simple command language, adequate
    on-line instruction, and a simplified natural language,
    keyword/stem approach to searching. it is concluded that
    operational interfaces of the type studied can provide for
    increased usability of existing systems in a cost effective
    manner, especially for inexperienced end users who cannot
    easily avail themselves of expert intermediary searchers.
    furthermo re, more advanced interfaces based on improved
    instruction and automated search strategy techniques could
    further enhance retrieval effectiveness for a wide class of
    users. for part 1, 2see1 preceding abstract.
