using case study in library research. contribution to an
    issue devoted to the application of qualitative approaches to
    the study of information problems. examines case-study
    research, its development, and its characteristics. the author
    has recently started a project which uses multi-site case
    studies to examine 6th-formers' capacity for independent
    library-based work. uses this as a framework to discuss
    questions to be considered by those contemplating this sort of
    research. considers 3 main sources of information (interviews,
    documents, and observation); their integration into case
    records; and the use of narration, vignette, and analysis as
    reporting methods. points out that it is crucial to find forms
    of presentation conducive to a critical reaction from the
    reader.
