effect of strong electrostatic fields on the resistance
    of tungsten wires in high vacua wires of diameter and were
    subjected to negative and positive radial fields of strength up
    to and cm respectively the resistance decreased abruptly on
    applying the field and increased abruptly on removing it
    regardless of its sign the change of resistance was
    proportional to the square of the field strength no explanation
    of the effect has been found slight increases of resistance
    during steady application of the field are associated with
    temperature increases attributed to effects of ion photo and
    field emission currents
