bibliotherapy in the context of psychotherapy for
    patients with nervous disorders. neurotically disturbed
    patients undergoing group therapy treatment were presented with
    6 literary texts, including works by boll and saint-exupery;
    their reactions to them were analysed and compared with those
    of a group of people in normal health. the patients regarded
    the texts subjectively, using them as a basis for discussion of
    their own personal difficulties; the others saw in the texts an
    objective reflection of general social problems. the hospital
    librarian had to find texts that would have a suitable
    significance for patients and provide a starting point for the
    required therapy. it is important that the librarian should
    work closely with the medical staff in situations involving
    bibliotherapy.
