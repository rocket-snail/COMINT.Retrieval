strengthen the workers' influence. the norwegian
    association of municipal library workers (kommunale
    bibliotekarbeideres forening) has regularly published its
    periodical 2kontakten, 1has developed liaison with the
    norwegian association of local authorities (nkf), reports
    satisfactory branch activity, and has over 600 members. it has
    however no real influence on library policy. further advances
    depend on increased financial resources and an active
    membership. it is an essential link between library staff and
    the association of local authorities. better-organised
    cooperation with other library bodies is important. the
    influence of library workers must be strengthened in major
    fields concerning library policy, such as the national library
    council, library education, and computerisation. the incoming
    committee would benefit from members with trade union
    experience and an interest in library policy.
