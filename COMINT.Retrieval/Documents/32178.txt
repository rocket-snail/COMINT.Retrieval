an alternative isbn checking algorithm. the international
    standard book number is well known as a title identifier in
    bibliographic retrieval systems, as a control number for isbn
    assigned monographs appearing on the uk marc record, and as a
    stock-item identifier in the book trade. equally well-known is
    the helpful characteristic that isbns exhibit whereby their
    10th and final character serves as a check-digit, minimising
    data entry errors. other well-known identifiers, such as the
    library of congress number and the british national
    bibliography number which serve respectively as control numbers
    on the lc marc record and on the uk marc record for non-isbn
    assigned monographs, do not exhibit comparable self-validating
    characteristics.
