removal of an inconsistency in the theory of diffraction
    in certain cases the integral equations involved in analysis of
    the diffraction of small amplitude acoustic or em waves give a
    solution which does not satisfy the boundary conditions imposed
    but which agrees with the solution found by other means this
    inconsistency is removed if different boundary conditions are
    imposed in the formulation of the problem this is illustrated
    by discussion of two dimensional diffraction of a plane em wave
    by a perfectly conducting semi infinite plane
