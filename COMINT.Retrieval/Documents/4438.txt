on demands to remodel library conditions at the 5 'old'
    universities (technical colleges) in the state of north
    rhine-westphalia. the 1979/80 library guide to the aachen
    university library functions simultaneously as a critique of
    conditions at the library. aachen is now a university with
    almost 30,000 students but the library system is largely
    decentralised with many small institute libraries. some of
    these have been reorganised and rehoused, but many still need
    to be restructured. there is a lack of centralisation and
    coordination which can be found out most of the 'old' north
    rhine-westphalia universities which are not planned, campus
    universities. there is a need for a complete catalogue of
    library stock. library guides such as the aachen example are of
    great valueand should be published at all the libraries. it is
    also necessary to integrate small institute libraries to
    improve coordination work. librarians are of the opinion that
    libraries should be treated as individual cases and that plans
    and laws for remodelling library conditions should beware of
    generalisation.
