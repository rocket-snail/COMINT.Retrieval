a consideration of the mechanism of electron removal in
    the f layer of the ionosphere the transformation of atomic ions
    into molecular ions by a transfer of charge and the subsequent
    recombination of molecular ions with electrons are considered
    theoretically such a mechanism may possibly explain the
    attachment type of electron removal but the theory fails to
    give the value of the attachment coefficient and of its
    variation with height
