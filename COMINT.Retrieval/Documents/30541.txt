reference database use: a new application of online
    searching. the use of on-line searching by reference librarians
    to provide actual answers and not just bibliographies or
    current awareness printouts has the potential to save time and
    money for the reference department. the quick reference service
    can actually promote rather than compete with the library's
    on-line search service for in-depth subject searching. among
    the most common applications of the quick reference service are
    verification, collection development, and answering short
    questions about persons, organisations, and new fields of
    interest. report not available from ntis.
