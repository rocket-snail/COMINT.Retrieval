very high frequency absorption in super conductors
    measurements indicate that the temperature at which the
    absorption departs from that in the normal state differs from
    the transition temperature by an amount strongly dependent on
    the frequency a brief discussion shows that this dependence
    follows immediately from the concept of a gap in the electron
    energy level spectrum of a superconductor
