new types of dc amplifier the reflex monitor system a
    correcting amplifier or monitor identical to the input stage of
    the main amplifier corrects alternately its own drift and that
    of the main amplifier a differential input is used which
    rejects in phase drift components and residual drifts are
    balanced between the two amplifiers full details are given of a
    practical circuit which has certain advantages over the simpler
    cascade balance system described in part above
