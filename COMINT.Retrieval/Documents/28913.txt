protection of the individual, libraries and computers.
    the introduction of computerised identification has alarmed
    many people in denmark as elsewhere. under an 1978 act the
    national library office has already encountered problems on
    cataloguing and authors' royalties. the main question concerns
    the linking of borrower to book, though this was equally
    possible with older issue systems. in 2 recent cases involving
    terrorism and murder, libraries have reluctantly supplied
    police with information generally regarded as confidential. the
    library office proposes an explicit statement of librarians'
    duty to maintain confidentiality, abd stricter control of
    out-of-date photographic issue records. when computer issue
    systems become common, such information will be more easily
    obtained, and the danish library commission considers that it
    should be made impossible to trace a borrower once his book is
    returned. while this should be covered by the 1978 act, any
    future revision of the library act should state the position in
    unambiguous terms.
