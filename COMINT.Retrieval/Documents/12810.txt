equilibrium electron distributions in the ionospheric f
    layer the equilibrium equation has been solved numerically for
    the daytime f region using isothermal and actual ionospheric
    models at the f layer peak the effects of production loss and
    plasma diffusion are approximately equal below the peak
    diffusion is unimportant but becomes dominant above it where
    the electron distribution takes on an exponential form
