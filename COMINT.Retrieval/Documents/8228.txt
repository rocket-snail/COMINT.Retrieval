the reflection and absorption of radio waves in the
    ionosphere investigations of the absorption of rf waves made in
    britain since are reviewed and the theory f ionospheric
    absorption is outlined the effects of double refraction
    polarization spatial attenuation dispersion ionospheric
    inhomogeneities and partial reflection which modify the
    apparent attenuation of radio waves reflected in the ionosphere
    are discussed and methods used to minimize absorption
    measurement errors due to these factors are given the
    experimental techniques used in routine absorption measurements
    being described fully detailed results of measurements of
    ionospheric absorption made in south east england in the period
    are being published separately
