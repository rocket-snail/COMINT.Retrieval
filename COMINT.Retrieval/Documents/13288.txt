immigrant workers and their families in the netherlands.
    in the netherlands there are now more than 250,000 immigrant
    workers and their relatives from the poorer mediterranean
    countries together with a further 200,000 from the former dutch
    colonies. for a number of years branch libraries in areas with
    large numbers of immigrant residents have provided material in
    the immigrants' native languages. at national level the
    nederlands bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for
    libraries and literature) set up a committee on public library
    services for immigrant workers in jan 78. the report of the
    committee published in 1979 recommended the national
    coordination of the provision of library materials for
    immigrants and the appointment of a staff-member at the nblc
    with special responsibility for services to immigrants.
