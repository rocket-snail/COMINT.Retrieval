limitations in squaring with simple valve circuits of
    wide bandwidth the errors to be expected from squaring circuits
    based on curvature of a valve characteristic with input applied
    to one electrode and b using separate control electrodes with
    antiphase inputs are compared measurements have been made on
    the latter type
