a model for a weighted retrieval system. recent articles
    have analysed retrieval systems with continuous weights of
    various types and/or with a boolean structure for the queries.
    they have also suggested criteria which such systems ought to
    satisfy and record evaluation mechanisms which partially
    satisfy these criteria. offers a more careful analysis, based
    on a generalisation of the discrete weights. also looks at the
    weights from an entirely different approach involving
    thresholds, and generates an improved evaluation mechanism
    which seems to fulfil a larger subset of the desired criteria
    than previous mechanisms. this new mechanism allows the user to
    attach a 'threshold' to the query term.
