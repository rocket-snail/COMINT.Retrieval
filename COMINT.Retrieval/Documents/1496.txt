calculation of group indices and group heights at low
    frequencies a formula is derived from which the group index
    designated for normal incidence including collision effects can
    be easily computed as a function of the real and imaginary
    parts of the refractive index for frequencies below a set of
    curves can then be prepared from which the group height to be
    expected from a given electron density profile can be quickly
    determined by graphical methods
