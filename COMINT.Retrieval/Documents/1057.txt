control of thyratrons by small signals variations of the
    phase of the control grid voltage enables the power supplied by
    a thyratron to an external circuit to be varied continuously
    over a wide range the results obtained with small control
    voltages indicate that although signals as small as may be
    permissible when the thyratron forms part of a feedback system
    large signals should be used whenever possible
