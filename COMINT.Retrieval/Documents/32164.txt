optical theory of thermal velocity effects in cylindrical
    electron beams the present theory is based on a nonlaminar
    optical model which treats thermal velocities as an integral
    part of the motion a maxwellian distribution of initial
    transverse velocities is assumed at the cathode and a first
    order focusing theory is applied in order to calculate
    trajectories at any point in the beam it is shown that whenever
    a long beam is confined by a focusing field images of the
    cathode are formed repeatedly along the axis when applied to
    uniform magnetic focusing fields the theory predicts the
    periodic formation along the axis of cathode images and
    crossovers and a relative rotation of successive images such
    effects have been reported
