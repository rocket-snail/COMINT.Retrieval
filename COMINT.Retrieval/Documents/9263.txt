coupling of cathode followers in dc amplifiers a
    symmetrical phase reversal circuit is described which together
    with screen coupled cathode follower stages has resulted in the
    development of an amplifier operated from a single source
    giving a gain of db and having a flat response up to kcs the
    level of the fluctuation noise voltage is almost too low to be
    measurable
