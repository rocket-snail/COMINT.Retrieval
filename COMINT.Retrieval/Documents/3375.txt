study of the paramagnetic faraday effect from a study of
    propagation in a gyromagnetic medium the magnitude of the
    faraday effect is determined as a function of the constant of
    the medium the theory is applied to rotation in paramagnetic
    salts and curves are derived for the rotation angle as a
    function of the applied field a description is given of
    experimental apparatus and results of measurements on mn and fe
    salts at wave lengths of one and ten cm are compared with
    theoretical calculations
