the unit step the unit pulse and the dirac operator the
    unit pulse is identified as the derivative of the unit step and
    the identity between the unit pulse and the dirac function is
    demonstrated by considering the establishment of a direct
    current in a circuit with finite inductance but vanishing
    capacitance
