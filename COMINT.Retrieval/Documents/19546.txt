national electromagnetic oscillations in a rectangular
    cavity with walls of finite conductivity in the limiting case
    of infinite wall conductivity the te and tm self oscillations
    have the same frequency this does not hold for finite wall
    conductivity in which case linear combinations of the te and tm
    oscillations with the same frequency exist these combinations
    termed matched oscillations represent to a first approximation
    the natural oscillations of the actual resonator the
    determination of the characteristics of these matched
    oscillations is based on the solution of a simple geometrical
    problem from which the damping and mistuning are
    calculated
