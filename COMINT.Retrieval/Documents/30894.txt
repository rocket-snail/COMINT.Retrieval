the distribution of radiation across the solar disk at
    metre wavelengths measurements were made at wavelengths of and
    using variable aperture interferometers an phase switching
    receiver systems the size of the emitting disk increases with
    increasing wavelength experiments with interferometers inclined

    radiating shape of thesun to be elliptical the radial distance
    at which the brightness temperature was reduced to half was
    about greater at the equator than in the polar direction
