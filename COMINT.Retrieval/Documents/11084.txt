county libraries' regional service-problems and lines of
    development. the norwegian library system is currently in a
    phase of stagnation, partly due to economic factors, but also
    because of uncertainties in several areas. discussion continues
    on the introduction of computerisation, and a rationalisation
    programme, now over 10 years old, is attempting to apportion
    functions and financial responsibility between government and
    local authorities. county libraries, with their triple task of
    advisory service, inter-library lending, and mobile library
    service, are particularly vulnerable. these services, which
    benefit public libraries, school libraries and individual
    readers, could be adversely affected by some rationalisation
    proposals. the first 2 could be maintained and improved if
    county libraries were made national institutions attached to
    large municipal libraries. mobile services are poorly developed
    in norway, partly because not all areas are geographically
    suitable. a restructuring of th e country's library system is
    urgently needed, and county librarians must evaluate their own
    position and services.
