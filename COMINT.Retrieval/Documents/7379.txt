effect of the solar eclipse on the lower parts of the
    ionosphere and the geomagnetic field changes in layer electron
    density observed at a number of stations during the solar
    eclipse of have been examined and the resulting changes in
    conductivity deduced the effects are found to exist over a very
    much wider area than that eclipsed the calculated modifications
    in the current consequent upon the electron density changes
    provide a satisfactory quantitative explanation of changes in
    the earths magnetic field at the time of the eclipse
