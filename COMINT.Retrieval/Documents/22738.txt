detection of electrons in the upper atmosphere by the
    third earth satellite electrons of energies were detected by
    means of two fluorescent screens covered with thin al foil of
    different thickness used in conjunction with photomultipliers
    the flux increases sharply with decreasing energy at high
    latitudes the night time energy flux reaches a few tens of ergs
