an ac voltage stabilizer high regulation factor short
    response time low e weight and frequency independence are
    achieved in a valve regulator with a carbon pile variable
    resistor control element and local as well as overall feedback
    in the form described the regulator is suitable for supplying
    filament current for a large number of valves
