dynamic core behaviour and magnetic amplifier performance
    discrepancies between theoretical analyses and measurements of
    magnetic amplifier performance are attributed to excessively
    simplified representations of core behaviour experimentally
    acquired knowledge of core flux characteristics is used to
    predict the operation of amplifier systems
