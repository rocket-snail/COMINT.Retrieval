a method of generating pairs of millimicrosecond current
    pulses separated by a variable interval the first pulse is
    formed by the discharge of a coaxial line l through a spark gap
    into a variable length section of identical line a second pulse
    is produced by the return of the first pulse after reflection
    at the short circuited end further reflections from the other
    end of l are prevented by a clipping valve
