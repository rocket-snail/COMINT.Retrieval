ideal staff for technological university libraries.
    contribution to an issue on education for technological
    university library work. with reference to the situation at the
    helsinki (finland) university of technology libraries, offers a
    personal view on training and qualifications of staff in such
    libraries. emphasises the importance of basic training in
    engineering, physics, and chemistry; the need for knowledge of
    languages; and the need for education in library and
    information science. suggests the option of an earlier
    retirement age for library staff so that new staff members are
    as young, service-minded, and non-bureaucratic as
    possible.
