problems of developing information services in social
    sciences. until well into the 70s traditional information
    channels were used when dealing with information about social
    sciences. the expansion of research in the area necessitated
    more planned information services. the slow development of
    theses is due to the lack of financial resources, to the
    special nature of social sciences, the needs of social
    scientists to obtain information outside their field, to the
    unwillingness of social scientists to use information services,
    and to the lack of standardised terminology in the
    field.
