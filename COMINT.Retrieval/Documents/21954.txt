the transistor as a amplifier for use in microwave
    measurements a junction type transistor with emitter earthed
    may have a current amplification as high as with low input
    impedance and high output impedance such an arrangement is
    seful for amplifying the current from a rectifier before
    application to a meter and enables the usual galvanometer to be
    replaced by a robust microammeter
