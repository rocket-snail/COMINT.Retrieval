nonlinearity of the volt ampere characteristics of
    silicon carbide resistors results of an experimental
    investigation of the conductivity and conductivity and
    conductivity voltage characteristics of sic powders under a
    pressure of show that as the field strength increases the
    conductivity becomes proportional to the square root of the
    field strength this is probably due to an increase of the
    effective area of contact electron micrographs of typical sic
    crystal surfaces are shown results obtained using crystals
    graded according to size are shown graphically and are
    discussed from the point of view of producing a resistor with
    the greatest possible nonlinearity
