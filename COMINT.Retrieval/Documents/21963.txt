the zero growth syndrome and the libraries' work for
    reforms. contribution to a panel debate on public libraries in
    the 80s, organised by the danish library inspectorate and held
    in oct 81. libraries are faced with a situation in which their
    use, especially that involving reference services, grows, while
    demands for cuts or zero growth are made. librarians have to
    give up some services, such as lengthy literature searches, in
    order to keep a balance in the general service level and are
    faced with an invidious choice between the kinds of
    material-newspapers, reference books, journals-which have to be
    axed. there is a need for an overall planning body which can
    decide priorities on professional grounds. argues for
    strengthening of the reference sections in smaller libraries by
    appointment of reference librarians and for the free
    distribution of the national bibliography to all publicly owned
    libraries. centrally produced reference aids help in the choice
    of priorities and free staff for othe r tasks, but more are
    needed. a period of cuts should be used to plan future
    expansion.
