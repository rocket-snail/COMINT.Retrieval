serials departments' doomed to extinction?. because tasks
    and materials related to serials processing and use are often
    dispersed in a library, serials specialists must develop
    personal influence strategies and use informal communications
    systems which cross organisational boundaries. in the absence
    of a serials department, serials specialists and informal
    serials communication systems will continue to exist. it is
    widely agreed that informal communication systems emerge
    spontaneously in organisations and individuals with no formally
    conferred authority may use various types of personal influence
    strategies to achieve organisational objectives. while serials
    processing and public service could be most efficiently handled
    through a serials department, informal communication systems,
    utilised by serials specialists, will develop if such a
    department does not exist. in determining if a serials
    department has a place in a particular library organisation,
    library planners should be concerned a bout natural
    communication channels and should try to identify individuals
    who can communicate effectively across organisational
    barriers.
