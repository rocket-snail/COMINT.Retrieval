the euronet telecommunications network-its future role?.
    the euronet telecommunications network is a packet based data
    network initially provided to enable low cost access to be
    obtained to scientific, technical and socio-economic data bases
    within the european economic community. it has however served
    as a means to standardise data communications protocols
    throughout the community and has provided a stimulus for
    telecommunications administrations to establish not only
    national networks which when interconnected will enable the
    initial euronet network to be absorbed, but also new services
    capable of utilising packet switched networks. the planned
    availability of these networks on a european scale is now
    providing a stimulus to manufacturers of data terminals to make
    available new ranges of equipment capable of exploiting the
    special facilities offered by a packet based network for
    message transmission and euronet could provide a testbed to
    assist in this development.
