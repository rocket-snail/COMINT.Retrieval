a theory of spread f based on a scattering screen mod
    oblique rays from the sounder are scattered by a scattering
    screen into the f region whence they are reflected back to the
    sounder for frequencies appreciably higher than the f region
    penetration frequency there is a linear relation between the
    minimum virtual height of the returned signal and the operating
    frequency all virtual heights above this minimum value and
    below the normal vertical incidence value are possible this
    fact accounts for spread echoes being enclosed by two sharp
    defined boundaries this hypothetical picture agrees with that
    obtained from actual ionograms but requires that the screen be
    above e region heights
