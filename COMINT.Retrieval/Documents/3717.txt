the electronic data processing project limba/dalis for
    public libraries. recent increases in public library readership
    and loans demand more rationalisation. the limba project is
    concerned with the production by electronic data processing of
    guard catalogues for public libraries, the book form being
    considered more compact and portable than card files. each
    volume is planned in 3 sections, namely' science and other
    non-fiction; fiction; and children's literature. the contents,
    corresponding with library stocks in large branch libraries,
    will be kept up to date by the publication of cumulative
    supplements every 6 months. new complete editions are planned
    every 2 years. the book catalogues are intended to replace card
    catalogues in branches, small municipal and rural libraries and
    in trade union libraries. limba's data bank file dalis is the
    1st stage of a complete electronic data processing system
    planned for public libraries.
