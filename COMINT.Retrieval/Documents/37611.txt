dsir ionospheric absorption measuring equipment main
    design features are described of pulse transmitting and
    receiving equipment used at slough since highly stable
    operation is essential pulse duration is variable between and
    the frequency range is and a peak power output of is adequate
    for observer reception phombic delta and folded dipole
    transmitting aerials have been used the receiver is a
    superheterodyne with extra higigh gain and dynamic range and
    with provision for attenuation varying continuously up to about
    db double doublet and folded dipole receiving aee been used the
    display unit is a conventional cro
