the architects' competition for the limited liability
    company library. gutersloh public library was founded in 1979
    as a limited liability company by the municipal council and the
    firm of bertelsmann. in 1980, since existing accommodation was
    too small, an architects' competition was held to design a new
    library based on the '3-tier system'. details are given of the
    top 5 designs. the winner has placed on the ground floor a
    passage running right through the library to the park beyond;
    off this passage is the '1st tier' of popular fiction and
    non-fiction, issue counter and readers' cafe with newspapers.
    the 1st and 2nd floors house more fiction, non-fiction and
    periodicals; the 2nd floor also houses study carrels, media
    centre, conference room, stack, art centre and offices. the
    administration section is on the 3rd floor and the children's
    library on the lower ground floor.
