a phasor method of nonlinear network analysis the network
    is represented by the sum of a finite number of simple
    sinusoidal functions with time chosen from a knowledge of the
    network experiment and preliminary analysis an appendix
    illustrates stability tests and an application of the method to
    a typical problem
