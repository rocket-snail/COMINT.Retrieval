man made heating and ionization of the upper atmosphere
    absorption of radio signals by cyclotron resonance is shown to
    be possible within a very narrow layer of the atmosphere km
    thick just below for a plane polarized signal only of the power
    can be absorbed better results are obtained with a circularly
    polarized radio wave the absorbable power is limited by the
    effects obtained so that an electron density of and an electron
    temperature of cannot be exceeded the reason for this is the
    weakness of the a earths magnetic field
