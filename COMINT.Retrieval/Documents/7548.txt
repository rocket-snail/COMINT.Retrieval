new life in the old varde. gives a portrait of varde
    public library, due to take possession of a new main library in
    the central town square. varde has been in library union with 2
    other local authorities since 1973, serving a total of 28,000
    inhabitants with 1 mobile and 10 branch libraries. the new
    library will have 1500 sq.m. with room for expansion, making a
    music library possible eventually. interviews the mayor and
    chairman of the union library, who is prepared to allocate more
    money to the service if demand increases. the mobile library
    has been very successful in areas too sparsely populated to
    sustain branches. party politics is fortunately absent among
    politicians dealing with libraries. they must, however, have
    the final responsibility in book selection, while interfering
    as little as possible. interviews the chief librarian. since
    the union, space problems have mounted, and with the new
    library, loans are expected to increase without extra
    allocation for staff. would like to se e another mobile library
    replace some of the branches which have few loans. the mobile
    library has brought new readers to the main library. however,
    the use of 1 of the branches visited was such that a mobile
    library could not replace it.
