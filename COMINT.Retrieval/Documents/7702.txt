contact phenomena continuation of investigation noted in
    above if the two barrier layers have the same transparency the
    usual formula for contact potential is found in terms of the
    constants of the dunshma richardson equation if the two barrier
    layers have different transparencies a correction term comes
    into play analysis indicates that by making sufficiently
    accurate measurements of contact potential it should be
    possible to separate emission constant variation due to
    variation due to variation of work function with temperature
    from that due to barrier transparency
