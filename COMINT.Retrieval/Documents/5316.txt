evaluation of the working of a specialised data automated
    information retrieval system for chemistry. a soviet
    non-bibliographic information retrieval system for chemistry,
    ftor, uses a specially developed descriptor language with
    lexical units that are (1) structural fragments of chemical
    compounds and (2) those chemical bonds which change during
    reactions. the precision of retrieval was investigated and
    found to decrease when the retrieval language was not used
    properly.
