this one-sided praxis-worship. a norwegian state library
    school student rebuts 3 claims made by previous writers
    (special section on library education in norway, 2ibid1 46 (8)
    1979; 2see1 81/60)' (1) that lecturers have too little
    practical library experience (&h have extensive library
    experience, while the others maintain contact with current
    library practice); (2) that the course contains too little
    practical training (the new 3-year theoretical curriculum is a
    step forward. internal and external practical work, though
    still necessary, are of limited value in a constantly
    developing national library system. the school's primary task
    is to educate independent, critical librarians who can evaluate
    their role in a sociological perspective and be open to
    development and change); and (3) that instruction is too
    theoretical (on the contrary, there is a tendency to over-value
    diligence and hard work, viewing librarianship as a service
    industry rather than a scholarly discipline). a more library
    /sociological- and project-oriented curriculum is needed,
    calling for a different type of commitment from both students
    and lecturers.
