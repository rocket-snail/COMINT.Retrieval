liberalism incarnate and mediocrity on the rails.
    interviews the author, per hojholt, who argues that libraries
    could support quality literature more effectively by ordering
    more copies of good books. instead libraries, giving in to
    popular demand, contain a surfeit of mediocre authors. local
    freedom to select is largely an illusion as in practice the
    binding centre's reviews are heavily relied upon. the
    popularity of sociological and women's novels should not be
    ignored entirely, however, as libraries have an obligation to
    cater both for quality and topicality. authors of school and
    children's books, on the one hand, and of adult books, on the
    other, should have their library fees assessed separately. the
    work of children's librarians is educational and social and
    their training should reflect this; literary quality hardly
    applies to children's literature. suggests sale of books in
    libraries to ensure the survival of the book trade.
