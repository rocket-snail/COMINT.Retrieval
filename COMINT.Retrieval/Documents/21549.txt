criteria for the amplitude stability of a power
    oscillator stability criteria for a tuned anode oscillator are
    established in the form of two inequalities derived from
    differential equations expressing the voltage variations of the
    grid and anode and involving the ratio of feed back power to
    anode power the ratio of the time constant of the grid leak and
    capacitor combination to the time constant of the tank circuit
    and functions of the angles of current flow for grid and anode
    experimental verification of the results using a triode is
    reported
