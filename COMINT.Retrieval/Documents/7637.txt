blocking oscillators the use of blocking oscillators as
    generators of voltage or current pulses or of repetitive
    sawtooth voltage or current waveforms is examined in some
    detail with a description of thd mode of operation of the vz
    various circuits considered and discussion of the factors
    affecting their practical design
