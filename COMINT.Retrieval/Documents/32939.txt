the cognitive style of reference librarians. reports on
    research to determine the cognitive style of reference
    librarians on the field dependence/field independence dimension
    and to relate cognitive style to personal and professional
    variables, such as role perception, type of library affiliation
    and graduate qualification. cognitive style is defined as a
    person's habitual method of functioning in perceptual and
    intellectual activities and field dependence/independence
    classifies people according to their tendency to view an object
    as integrated with its surroundings. reference librarians with
    social sciences qualifications were found to be the most field
    dependent group and those with arts and science qualifications
    were found to be the most field independent.
