diffraction of cm electromagnetic waves by dielectric
    rods part lucite diameter semicylinder fields very close to
    surface the diffraction field is examined very close to the
    surface of a lucite semicylindrical rod with its plane surface
    at various orientations relative to the axis of propagation of
    the incident wave parts of
