cooperative links made by leipzig municipal music
    library. publicity work places great demands upon a special
    library. leipzig music library works closely with music
    publishers, schools, youth clubs, the university and the
    national association of composers and musicologists and is
    developing links with the local theatre and music schools. this
    results in cooperative organisation and finance for musical
    activities, justified because of the value of live performances
    and the use of a wide range of public library material. there
    is good publicity for the music library's stock of 140,000
    items including some valuable 1st editions. agreements with
    composers and publishers result in the provision of information
    on new publications and 1st performances and in a rational use
    of money. publication exchanges are especially useful. through
    cooperation with the university, music librarianship training
    can be provided for staff.
