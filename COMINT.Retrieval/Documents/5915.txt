about periodicals and the varied nature and function of
    their indexes, inventories or catalogues. after consideration
    of molinari's 2the roman periodical press in the nineteenth
    century, 1instances catalogues of periodicals possessed by a
    single library and more than one library. cites catalogues of
    italian and foreign periodicals possessed by the majority of
    libraries and dealing with a specified topic. concludes with
    catalogues of a city or region. a need exists to rationalise
    this multiplicity of sources. the state and the central
    institute for the union catalogue in rome should produce a
    localised general index of italian and foreign periodicals
    possessed by the greatest number of italian libraries.
    coordination on a national scale should follow. periodicals
    should be treated as archives to preserve italian political,
    civil, economic and spiritual history.
