on the use of commercial wire wound resistors in high
    level video amplifiers by compensating the inherent inductance
    by means of a parallel network commercial wire wound resistors
    can be adapted for use in high power video amplifiers practical
    arrangements are illustrated and results of measurements are
    compared with calculated values
