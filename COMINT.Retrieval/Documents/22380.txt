reading russian literature in a multi-national context.
    traditionally russian literature has tackled the problems of
    minority nationalities, while its widespread dissemination has
    helped bond those peoples together. a research project to
    determine the impact of russian literature today on non-russian
    peoples within the ussr was recently undertaken by the lenin
    state library. the project considered the availability of
    russian literature, the extent to which it was read and the
    value attributed to such reading. the project is intended to
    recommend to libraries levels of provision and methods of
    promoting such literature, and the research methods used will
    provide a format for future projects.
