the possibility of forecasting solar phenomena and their
    terrestrial repercussions by the study of the intensity of
    cosmic radiation an analysis of observations made from april to
    march shows that a decrease in cosmic ray intensity of occurs
    before chromospheric eruptions which are followed by intense
    geomagnetic and ionospheric disturbances this decrease also
    precedes or coincides with an increase in solar rf noise see
