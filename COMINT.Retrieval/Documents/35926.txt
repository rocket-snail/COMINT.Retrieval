the problem of increasing the frequency stability of
    crystal oscillators by means of compensation herzogs method of
    improving the pierce oscillator by including a compensating
    resistance is investigated the dependence of the oscillator
    frequency on the circuit parameters with or without
    compensation is calculated the advantages of compensation are
    offset by serious drawbacks especially in crystal clock
    applications
