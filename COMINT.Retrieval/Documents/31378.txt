mode of reference and its role in semantic
    representations of sentences. conceives a mode of reference as
    a generalisation of a variety of different concepts used by
    linguists and logicians in describing relations between
    linguistic expressions and non-linguistic reality (such as
    term, predicate, referentiality). proposes a calculus for the
    mode of reference of a russian noun phrase, based on the set of
    features of a noun phrase which exhaustively characterise its
    mode of reference. explores the influence of the mode on the
    phrase's syntactic and anaphoric properties and discusses the
    possibility of indicating the mode of a noun phrase in semantic
    representations of sentences.
