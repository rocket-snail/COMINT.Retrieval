political literature in scientific libraries. bearing in
    mind the importance of ideological education of every single
    citizen in a socialist country, the staff in scientific
    libraries are bound to pay due attention to political and other
    literature in the field of social sciences. it is desirable to
    set up special committees which have to find ways of maximising
    the effect of political literature upon readers. resolute
    policies must be pursued, starting with acquisition, which, in
    particular with respect to foreign political literature, must
    be highly selective. cataloguing and building up of
    bibliographic resources must satisfy the readers' needs in
    speedy current awareness. exhibitions on the occasion of
    important political anniversaries and topical events,
    establishment of specialised reading and study rooms, and also
    more intense research into the use of political literature are
    only a few of the suggestions to attract scientists to study
    this kind of literature permanently and to bene fit by it in
    their professional careers.
