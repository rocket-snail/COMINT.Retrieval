the transvar directional coupler the coupling element
    consists of closely spaced identical apertures separated by
    grid wires in the common narrow wall between two waveguides by
    changing the relative longitudinal position of the two
    waveguides the number of exposed apertures and hence the
    effective coupling length can be changed power transfer is
    variable between and at maximum power transfer is available at
    one frequency only and hence bandwidth depends on the tolerable
    decrease in power transfer two models with and differing only
    in grid wire diameter have maximum power transfer at about and
    respectively agreement between theory and performance is
    close
