statistical mechanical theory of a random ferromagnetic
    system study of the behaviour of solid solutions of
    paramagnetic impurities which are exchange coupled in a
    nonmagnetic substrate yields a considerable amount of
    information about the nature of the exchange coupling and the
    temperature dependence of the spin system
