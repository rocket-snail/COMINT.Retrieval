the reflexion of radio waves from a stratified ionosphere
    modified by weak irregularities consideration is given to the
    scattered wave which accompanies reflexion from a stratified
    ionosphere in which there are weak irregularities by
    considering these irregularities to be confined to a thin layer
    near a given height the possibility is examined that they might
    produce considerably enhanced scattering if they were situated
    near the reflexion level calculated on the basis of geometrical
    optics it is found that they would not have a very much greater
    effect at this level it is also shown that if the electron
    collision frequency is of the order likely to be encountered in
    the real ionosphere there would be little enhancement by
    resonance effects of the kind suggested by herlofson
