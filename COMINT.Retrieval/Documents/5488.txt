training librarians for the 80s. text of a paper given at
    the annual joint conference of the library association of
    ireland, and the library association, n. ireland branch, held
    in blarney, county cork in may 80. examines some likely areas
    of concern of professional education for librarians in the
    1980s, including: the need for more training in the management
    of the new technology; the increasing importance of information
    skills, particularly those associated with computerised
    information retrieval; and the increasing importance of
    collection development and the associated arts of book
    selection. argues that the present uk one year post graduate
    course for librarians is not long enough, and stresses the need
    for continuing education within the profession.
