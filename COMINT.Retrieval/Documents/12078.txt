in conversation with ina vintges. text of a discussion
    with w.m.e. vintges who retired from her post as head of
    library affairs at the netherlands bibliotheek en lectuur
    centrum (dutch centre for libraries and literature) in nov 81.
    until 1962 mrs vintges had been head of the roman catholic
    public library at tilburg, a post which involved her in serving
    on a number of national committees. in 1962 mrs. vintges was
    appointed general consultant with the centrale vereniging voor
    openbare bibliotheken (central association for public
    libraries) and joined the staff of the nblc in 1972. mrs
    vintges feels that the government's view of public libraries is
    too restricted and that public libraries as a basic service for
    education and social welfare should no longer be regarded as
    purely the responsibility of local authorities.
