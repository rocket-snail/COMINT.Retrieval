user training for students' workshop for a week at the
    methodological centre in gotha. the methodological centre for
    research libraries and information and documentation services
    in gotha held a workshop from 16-20 june 80 on the problems of
    user training for students. university teachers are required to
    instruct students in methods and techniques needed for using
    library and information services. this instruction should form
    an integral part of their studies to enable them to make full
    use of all available information in their field while studying
    and to keep abreast of developments later on. the workshop
    provided teachers with the opportunity to exchange ideas and
    experiences on the subject, talks were given dealing with
    specific cases of user training and 4 workgroups met to discuss
    ideas for further improvement. teachers should attend further
    education seminars to keep themselves up to date with
    developments in the user training area.
