radio reflections from aurora echoes at and werre
    observed when the auroral form exhibited some ray structure and
    then only from parts of the aurora at elevations above the
    horizon no echoes were recorded at mcs the echoes occur most
    frequently within the auroral zone the echoes some distance
    south of it it is suggested that echoes arise by critical
    reflection from centres of high electron density for echoes and
    cm for the echoes
