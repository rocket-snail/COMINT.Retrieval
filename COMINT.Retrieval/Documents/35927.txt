agricultural librarianship and documentation as a
    profession. translation of a paper presented at a congress of
    the iaald in manila in 1980, giving a general view of library
    and information services in the agricultural field in relation
    to librarianship in general and in other fields. a preliminary
    definition sets out the nature of the work of the agricultural
    librarian, and then the special characteristics of the field
    are discussed in detail' its interdisciplinary nature, the wide
    range of types of documentation, its international character,
    and the need to disseminate information to a diverse community
    representing a wide variety of educational backgrounds. the
    organisation and operation of existing services are examined
    with reference to information resources and cooperative
    activities, where the extent to which network opportunities are
    used depends on the scale and focus of services offered, and
    this in turn influences professional duties. the education and
    skills essential for the p rofessional are analysed in relation
    to the changes in information and library services in general
    caused by social and technological developments, which have
    created a need for alterations in library school curricula and
    the establishment of programmes of continuing education for
    practising librarians. finally potential developments to meet
    the demands of the future are considered.
