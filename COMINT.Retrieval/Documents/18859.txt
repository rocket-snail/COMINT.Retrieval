representation of the modes of motion of an undamped
    linear oscillating system with two degrees of freedom the
    general solution of the differential equations for a system
    comprising two coupled mas points corresponds to the
    superposition of two natural oscillations but a better idea of
    the phenomenon is obtained by considering the motion as a
    single oscillation modulated in phase and in amplitude this
    approach is illustrated graphically
