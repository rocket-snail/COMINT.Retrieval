impedance quadripoles for the frequency compensation of
    aerial input impedance networks with one or two frequency
    independent resistances are discussed which are capable of
    effecting wide band matching with lower losses than reactive
    circuits at frequencies up to or above composite coaxial line
    sections are used in an application to a dipole aerial for use
    with a parabolic cylinder reflector he compensating coaxial
    line serves as support for the dipole
