direct measurement of electron spin lattice relaxation
    times a discussion of the experimental problems encountered in
    making spin lattice relaxation measurements in electron
    paramagnetic systems at low temperatures gadolinium and chrome
    ion spin lattice relaxation times are given the relation of
    these spin lattice relaxation times to relaxation times
    measured in the frequency domain by observing a saturation
    parameter is discussed
