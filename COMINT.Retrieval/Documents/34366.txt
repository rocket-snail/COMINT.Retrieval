reverse characteristics with surface breakdown of silicon
    psn rectifiers the influence of surface recombination on the
    reverse and breakdown characteristics is investigated
    measurements were made on si rectifiers with weakly doped
    diffusion region which had been exposed to dry nitrogen and
    oxygen with or without ozone for different lengths of time with
    or without heat treatment for measurements in moist
    gases
