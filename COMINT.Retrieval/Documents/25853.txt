st. michael's league' an example of royal bavarian
    independence. the st. michael's league was founded in 1901 as
    an educational organisation for publishing newspapers and
    periodicals and controlling the roman catholic public libraries
    in bavaria. each parish library is subordinate to its diocesan
    centre and the state library centre provides a number of
    centralised services and overall administration. the league
    publishes a reviewing journal jointly with the borromeus
    association, a quarterly information sheet on library
    activities in bavaria, book lists and a handbook for the use of
    the staff, mainly volunteers, for whom short training courses
    are provided. close cooperation is maintained with local
    government. since 1968 the league has compiled annual
    statistics by electronic data processing; the programme is also
    used every 3 years for the compilation of statistics on all
    church libraries in west germany.
