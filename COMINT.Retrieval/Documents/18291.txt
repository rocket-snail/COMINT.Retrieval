theory of solar eclipse effects on the earths magnetic
    field the deformation of the current during a solar eclipse is
    represented by a current function which is superposed on the
    system and moves with the eclipse the magnetic field components
    of are computed and the influence of the part induced in the
    earths crust is discussed
