symbolic integration: the stormy decade three approaches
    to symbolic integration in the 1960's are described. the first,
    from artificial intelligence, led to slagle's saint and to a
    large degree to moses' sin. the second, from algebraic
    manipulation, led to manove's implementation and to horowitz'
    and tobey's reexamination of the hermite algorithm for
    integrating rational functions. the third, from mathematics,
    led to richardson's proof of the unsolvability of the problem
    for a class of functions and for risch's decision procedure for
    the elementary functions.generalizations of risch's algorithm
    to a class of special functions and programs for solving
    differential equations and for finding the definite integral
    are also described. august, 1971 moses, j. integration,
