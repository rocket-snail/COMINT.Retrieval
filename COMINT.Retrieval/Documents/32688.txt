the association of solar radio bursts of spectral type
    with chromospheric flares simultaneous optical and radio
    observations were made for over flares of which were of class
    and of which are associated with type events of the bursts were
    recorded during the life of the flare usually near the
    beginning the probability of a burst accompanying a flare is
    greater for large flares and is the same for flares on the east
    limb as for those in the centre of the disk this implies a wide
    cone of escape for type radiation
