experimental verification of the wave mechanical theory
    of field electron emission methods described br are used to
    calculate the current density and field strength at a tungsten
    point and hence to estimate the accuracy of results obtained
    previously consideration is extended to the case when the
    tungsten is coated with foreign atoms
