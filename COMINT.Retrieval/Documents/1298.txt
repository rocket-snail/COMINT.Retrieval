structure generation on the basis of bct representation
    of chemical structures. a method of structure generation based
    on bct (block-cutpoint tree) representation of chemical
    structures has been developed. the generation program is a part
    of the automatic structure analysis system of mass spectra
    (asasmas) and is used when a set of the inferred substructures
    are given as input data. the input substructures are
    represented by means of bct.
