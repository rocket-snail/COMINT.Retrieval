irregularities in refraction of radio waves and large
    inhomogeneities in the ionosphere description of the method and
    results of measurements of the vertical refraction of radio
    waves at in the ionosphere the irregularities of refraction are
    produced by inhomogeneities of dimensions about km in the f
    region the diurnal variation of inhomogeneities is analysed and
    it is shown that their presence is related to solar
    activity
