on the theory of giant pulsations a mathematical analysis
    of the propagation of a magneto ionic disturbance originating
    in the exosphere shows that only the rotational movement
    perpendicular to the geomagnetic field is propagated without
    great loss of energy the observed characteristics of giant
    pulsations suggest that they are mainly caused by this
    rotational component of the primary disturbance
