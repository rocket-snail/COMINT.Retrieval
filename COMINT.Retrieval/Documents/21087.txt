abnormalities in the ionosphere at high latitudes study
    of the variations with respect to time and location of the
    frequency of occurrence of storm s types e and d shows that the
    polar region may be divided into three zones the polar zone the
    storm belt and the polar quiet zone within the storm belt the
    most dense forms of storm e ionization are practically confined
    to an area centred near canada while the existence can be
    demonstrated of two centres of activity in the d region spaced
    apart which rotate once around the earth every hours
