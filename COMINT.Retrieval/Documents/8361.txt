wafer coil development for inductive components the
    automatic production of coils made of insulated metal foil
    instead of wire is described the roll of foil is sliced into
    thin wafers which can be connected in series to obtain the
    required inductance physical and electrical characteristics are
    similar to those of wirewound coils closer spacing of turns is
    possible than with printed circuit techniques
