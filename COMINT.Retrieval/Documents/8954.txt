absorption in a dielectric slab energy incident on a
    parallel slab of high loss material with high dielectric
    constant is considered at angles of incidence greater than the
    reflected energy is smaller the more lossy the material the
    absorbed energy is a maximum at certain angles of incidence
    depending on the polarization and dielectric constant
