some aspects of the librarian-user relationship. argues
    that direct librarian-user interaction is long overdue for
    close scrutiny, since this relationship may not be in harmony
    with the overall standard of other subsystems of the
    information centre. points out that, apart from qualifications
    and experience, a librarian must also possess a personality
    which is psychologically well balanced and adaptable, since a
    great deal of his/her work involves exposure to potentially
    stressful situations. these situations arise with users who are
    poorly informed about the practical difficulties associated
    with obtaining a particular information source and who are not
    able to appreciate that other readers have their pressing
    requirements as well. name tags for librarians should lead to
    greater personal responsibility. in large libraries direct user
    contact involves shift working for the predominantly female
    staff; this leads to difficulties and sometimes less than
    adequate personnel are exposed to the pu blic. this area of
    library services cries out for a systematic overhaul.
