investigation of the time delay in the triggering of a
    pulse in a monostable multivibrator results of experiments
    indicate that a monostable multivibrator may be used as a pulse
    amplifier in applications where waveform distortion is
    unimportant with pulse voltages above the multivibrator used
    showed time delays of less than and these were independent of
    pulse width over a wide range the gain obtainable is about time
    delays in a free running multivibrator are of the order of to
    sec this is shown theoretically to be due to the stray
    capacitances present
