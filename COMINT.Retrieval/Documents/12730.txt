the calculation of nonlinear networks by means of
    composite straight line characteristics many circuit problems
    are simplified by substituting for an actual curved
    characteristic an approximation built up of rectilinear
    sections use of the method is illustrated by studying the
    characteristics of iron cored coils with and without hysteresis
    and with and without magnetic bias and t by analysing the free
    oscillations of a circuit including an iron cored coil emphasis
    is a laid on the point that the actual shape of the nonlinear
    characteristic is less significant than the simple fact of its
    deviation from linearity
