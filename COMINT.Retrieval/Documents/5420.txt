magnetically keyed phase sensitive demodulators the
    operation and performance of a pulse shaping circuit using
    magnetic reactors is described the properties of three types of
    phase sensitive demodulator are compared diode demodulators
    have linear characteristics magnetic amplifier demodulators
    have high input impedance and transistor demodulators combine
    good linearity with low noise level
