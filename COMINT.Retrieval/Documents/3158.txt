the use of the kerr effect for studying the magnetization
    of a reflecting surface if a domain wall moving in an
    alternating field crosses a small area illuminated with plane
    polarized light the change in intensity of the reflected light
    passing through a nearly crossed analyser can be detected by
    use of a photo multiplier cell and by amplification of the
    alternating component of its output signal experimental results
    agree well with theoretical predictions see also
