experimental investigation of charge formation on a
    dielectric surface under the influence of electron bombardment
    part two the kinetics of the formation of an actual charged
    spot produced on the surface of a dielectric by an electron
    beam have been investigated the instrument and method are
    described and it is shown that the conditions for the formation
    of positive and negative spots are different
