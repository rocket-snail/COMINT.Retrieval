charge transfer in the upper atmosphere collision
    processes involving charged solar particles entering the upper
    atmosphere are discussed charge transfer reactions involving
    solar and ions are likely to excite spectrum lines of these
    elements and of the atmospheric gases in the case of at auroral
    levels the ratio of the density of to ions and the effective
    recombination coefficient for the layer are derived
