study of gyromagnetic resonance in the penning gauge
    conditions in the penning gauge are particularly favourable for
    studying r f radiation resulting from gyromagnetic resonance of
    electrons both longitudinal oscillations thermal agitation
    electrons involved resulting in accumulation in the anode
    planes the presence of plasma has an important effect on the
    potential distribution introducing a radial electric field the
    equations of electron motion are established some particular
    solutions indicate the possibility of a circular path in the
    anode plane with an angular frequency about half the
    gyrofrequency with values of magnetic induction between and
    radiation at decimetre wavelengths was produced measurements of
    the radiation are described investigation of the complete
    spectrum emitted indicates that coherent oscillations may occur
    the results are compared with those of other workers
