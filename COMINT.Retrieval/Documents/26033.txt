theory of antimetrical lattice filters the theory o a
    class of lattice filters with inverse image impedances is a
    counterpart of that for symmetrical filters these filters
    comprise two reactances and their inverses the frequencies at
    which the modulus of the reactances is equal to the he
    characteristic impedance correspond to the poles and zeros of
    the reactances in the symmetrical case calculations relative to
    the construction of such filters are explained and typical
    examples are described a high ratio impedance transformation is
    attainable with narrow band circuits see also of
