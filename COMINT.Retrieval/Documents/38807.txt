megavolt electronics cherenkov coupler for the production
    of millimetre and submillimetre waves cherenkov radiation at
    the watt level can be produced and beamed by passing a high
    harmonic electron beam through a mm hole in a large specially
    shaped teflon cone the measured radiated power shows good
    agreement with theory
