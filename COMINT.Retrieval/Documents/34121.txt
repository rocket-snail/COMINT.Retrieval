frequency components in the output of a harmonic
    generator driven by the sum of two sine waves a frequency
    analysis is given for the output of a generator which emits a
    constant amplitude pulse at each zero crossing of the input
    voltage consisting of the sum of two sine waves raised to an
    arbitrary dc level
