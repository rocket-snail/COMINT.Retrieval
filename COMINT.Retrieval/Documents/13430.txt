book reviews as aids to book selection. a small survey
    has been carried out at leicester university to find out what
    sources of information academics in science departments use
    when selecting books for purchasing by the university library.
    information was particularly required about the role of book
    reviews. while rarely giving first information about a book
    suitable for purchase, book reviews are read regularly by a 1/3
    of the staff of the departments included in the survey.
