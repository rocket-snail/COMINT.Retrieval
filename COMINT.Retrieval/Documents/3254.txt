transient analysis of junction transistor amplifiers in
    analysing transistor operation transit time effects must be
    taken into account this can be done to a sufficiently close
    degree of approximation by including in the equivalent circuit
    an rc network in series with an idealized delay line only
    simple laplace transforms are then involved in the response
    calculations the theory is supported by experimental
    results
