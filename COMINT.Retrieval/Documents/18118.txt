contribution on the problem of frequency dividing
    dividing circuits for both pulse and sinusoidal signals are
    discussed details are given of a simple locked in oscillator
    giving division factors up to a self starting regenerative
    divider and a divider with controlled oscillator a laboratory
    model of which gives division factors in a single step
