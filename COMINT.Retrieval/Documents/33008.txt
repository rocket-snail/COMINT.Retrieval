gangs of savers in a dance of cranes. 4 members of the
    librarians' union's working party on savings were asked to
    evaluate the library situation in view of the cuts in
    expenditure. they discussed the figures relating to running
    costs, staff and material costs produced by the library
    inspectorate and the effects of cuts on work loads and loans.
    views differed as to whether minimum norms should be laid down.
    they agreed that the union as a central organisation could do
    little to give guidelines for action in local situations. some
    thought members should refuse to take part in local working
    groups on savings set up to give priorities to cuts in
    different areas, as this was tantamount to condoning cuts,
    others thought useful information could be gained from
    participation and that local librarians should present
    politicans with well argued budget proposals and outline
    effects of particular cuts.
