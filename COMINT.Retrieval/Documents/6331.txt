instrumentation for the continuous measurement of certain
    ionospheric echo characteristics details are given of the
    receiving system associated with the equipment described by
    jones of a crossed loop aerial picks up both the direct and the
    reflected waves from the transmitter about km away the
    elliptically polarized echo is resolved into components which
    are appropriately combined and displayed in succession on a cro
    examples are shown of continuous photographic records obtained
    the resolution of split echoes is facilitated by suitably
    varying the cro beam intensity
