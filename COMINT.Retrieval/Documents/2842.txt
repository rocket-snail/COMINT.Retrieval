incidence of electromagnetic waves on double infinite
    grids the system considered comprises a double grid of parallel
    metal rods the grids are spaced apart and the rods in each grid
    are spaced apart the rods in one grid being staggered by an
    amount relative to the rods in the other grid the radius of the
    rods is calculations are made of the reflection coefficient and
    the refractive index corresponding to three values of for and
    for normal incidence with
