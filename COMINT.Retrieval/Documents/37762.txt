the need for improved worldwide provision of
    publications. national availability of publications must be
    supplemented by international availability. the best evidence
    for the need for better international provision is supplied by
    data on international lending. the volume of international
    lending and photocopying is about 1 million items a year and is
    growing rapidly. satisfaction rates and supply times both need
    improvement. about 2/3 of demand is for journals, and is
    concentrated on a small number of centres, which give a much
    better than average service. speed of supply appears to be
    unrelated to distance. possible patterns of provision for the
    future include access to improved collections of national
    imprints, regional systems, and large national document supply
    centres in countries with heavy interlending demand.
