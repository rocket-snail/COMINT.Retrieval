the scattering of waves at an uneven surface an
    approximate method is proposed for calculating the field of
    acoustic and electromagnetic waves scattered by an uneven
    surface the irregularities being large in comparison with the
    wavelength particular cases considered include that of
    sinusoidal corrugations
