cosmic ray measurements in the vicinity of planets and
    some applications part one primary cosmic radiation the
    variation of the primary cosmic ray intensity is calculated as
    a function of distance from a dipole in its equatorial plane
    scientific applications indicated include the determination of
    magnetic fields of the moon and planets
