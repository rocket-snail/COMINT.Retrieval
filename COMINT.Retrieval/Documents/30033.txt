horizontal movements in the ionosphere a survey of
    investigation methods and results under the following main
    headings reflected radio waves observed at closely spaced
    points observations of movements of large scale irregularities
    in the f region observations of waves from radio stairs
    observations of waves reflected from meteor trails observations
    of waves reflected from the sporadic e layer the following
    conclusions are reached at all levels in the ionosphere
    systematic as well as irregular horizontal movements are
    present typical velocities are of the order of there is a
    tendency for the velocity to increase with height the
    systematic movements have the form of regular diurnal and
    seasonal variations and show considerable consistency between
    observations made in the northern and southern hemispheres at
    heights around km the semi diurnal components of the velocity
    as determined by fourier analysis are found to represent a
    uniformly rotating velocity vector the direction of the
    rotation is clockwise in the northern hemisphere and anti
    clockwise in the southern hemisphere this is the type of
    movement predicted by the theory of atmospheric oscillations
    though the phase of the rotation is not that expected
    theoretically at times of magnetic disturbance the velocities
    of the horizontal movements are increased and this phenomenon
    becomes more marked with increasing height in the atmosphere at
    velocities as high as have been recorded during magnetic storms
    a brief summary of observations by non radio methods is
    included about references
