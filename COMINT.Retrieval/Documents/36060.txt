public library needs for blacks' a personal view. in
    south africa it often is alleged that blacks require the public
    library to offer services by which they can advance their
    knowledge and capabilities. on the maslow pyramid this could be
    considered a need at the basic level, while the reading of
    recreative works could be considered to lie at a higher level.
    in fact it is found that 72% of books borrowed by blacks
    consist of fiction. it may now be questioned whether the black
    community has already passed the basic reading level, or
    whether recreational reading forms part of that level. as some
    66% of the black membership of a library may consist of
    children, the high percentage of fiction circulated raises
    doubts about whether these children see libraries primarily as
    sources of information, and about the suitability of
    non-fiction provided. only about 5% of blacks use available
    library facilities. it should be investigated whether the
    educational approach is not being over-stressed in black public
    libraries.
