linear algebraic computation by multi winding
    transformers theory is presented of transformer circuits fol
    solving simultaneous equations and inequalities the reduction
    of errors due to transformer imperfections is discussed the
    practical aspects are illustrated by a problem involving
    checking the compatibility of ten inequalities with six
    variables the present device is similar to that described by
    mallock and
