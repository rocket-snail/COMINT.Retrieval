the evolution of an international library and
    bibliographic community. contends that the present far-reaching
    scope and variety of bibliographic and library activity at the
    international level, as manifested in the work of many
    different kinds of international organisation, are possible
    only because of the emergence after world war i of an
    international community which did not previously exist.
    suggests why, in the profession of librarianship, the league of
    nations organization for intellectual cooperation became the
    symbol of and centre for this community rather than the palais
    mondial or mundaneum, created by paul otlet and henri
    lafontaine in brussels over 20 years before.
