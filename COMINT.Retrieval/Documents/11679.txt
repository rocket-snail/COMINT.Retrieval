transresonant electron acceleration describes a mechanism
    additional to that of helliwell for the acceleration of van
    allen electrons by whistlers non relativistic electrons would
    be accelerated by whistlers of about field strength the
    mechanism depends on the whistler frequency doppler shifted by
    the electron velocity passing through the electron gyro
    frequency
