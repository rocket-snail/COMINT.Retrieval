parametric behaviour of an ideal two frequency varactor
    an analysis in which pump and signal voltages of large
    amplitude are allowed and the complete varactor characteristic
    is used with linear signal termination the ratio of signal to
    pump frequency must be where is an integer all possible
    operating modes are identified
