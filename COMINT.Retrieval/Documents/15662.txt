the evaluation of ionospheric observations a critical
    discussion of the various methods used in calculating the
    height distribution of the charge carrier concentration and
    other parameters from experimentally determined hf curves the
    corrections and the estimation of errors in the calculated f
    layer height in the presence of an e layer and the effect of
    neglecting the e layer in this calculation are discussed an
    approximate method is indicated for taking the geomagnetic
    field into account
