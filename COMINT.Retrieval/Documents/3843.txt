children's literature in english' a select, annotated
    bibliography, 1835-1935. since the 1950s the study of
    children's literature has developed into an autonomous academic
    discipline. research institutes and information centres as well
    as societies and associations in the field have proliferated.
    several scholarly periodicals are devoted entirely to
    children's literature. current academic interest in children's
    literature has been reflected in the growing number of
    dissertations and theses for advanced degrees. this tendency is
    also discernable in south africa. an information centre for
    children's literature and media (iskemus) was established at
    the university of stellenbosch in 1978. potchefstroom has an
    institute for research in children's literature which has
    already held 2 country-wide symposia and has had a book
    published under its auspices by tafelberg. academic study of
    the genre necessitates the formation of collections of
    children's books and media reflecting the personal bias an d
    interest of the researchers. such collection building has
    become increasingly difficult because investors regard fine
    children's books as sound financial investments because of
    their scarcity. at stellenbosch a private collection of about
    1,000 books reflects the cultural influence of mainly victorian
    english middle-class juvenile reading matter, 1830-1930. a very
    brief indication of some of the interesting items is reflected
    in the select, annotated abstract of the catalogue of
    historical books.
