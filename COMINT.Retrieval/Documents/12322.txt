surface investigation of metals and nonmetals with exo
    and photoelectrons the term exo electrons is applied to
    electrons emitted from a surface under excitation by light of
    sufficiently short wavelength an exothermic process being
    involved a description is given of the special geiger type
    needle counter used in th investigation the light source with
    plexiglas lenses being built into the counter results obtained
    are shown graphically and discussed they include curves showing
    the decay of exo and photo electron emission from energy
    treated pt stretched al and gypsum and temperature variation of
    exo electron emission from gyprsum quartz and quinine sulphate
    subjected to various types of irradiation
