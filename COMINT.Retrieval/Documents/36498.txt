auckland public's on-line information service. in june
    80, a new zealand post office oasis terminal (overseas access
    service to information systems) started operating in the
    commerce, science and technology department of auckland public
    libraries. its advent was accompanied by articles in local
    papers, public demonstrations, and basic on-line training of
    library staff. describes the experience gained during the 1st
    10 months of the service and discusses changing philosophies
    worldwide. concludes that on-line searching is coming to be
    regarded as an extension of traditional reference services; it
    will never be self-financing and must be planned, budgeted for,
    introduced and directed like any other aspect of library work;
    its speed highlights the present slowness of document delivery;
    and it is a new challenge to the librarian's professional
    competence and judgement.
