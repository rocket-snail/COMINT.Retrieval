electric discharge caused by meteorites moving in the
    earths atmosphere the passage of meteorites through the
    atmosphere is followed by the formation of a trail of ionized
    gas about ten km long and of five m radius the luminosity of
    the meteorite is attributed to a corona discharge in the front
    of the trail and in the case of bright meteorites in strong
    electric fields this discharge becomes a spark discharge of the
    lightning type
