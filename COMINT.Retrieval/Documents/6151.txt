classification of atmospheric waveforms the desirability
    and requirements of a systematic classification of atmospheric
    waveforms are discussed an observational scheme is suggested
    and interpreted in terms of known properties of the discharge
    and propagation mechanisms these data are reviewed to clarify
    application of the scheme to individual waveforms the relation
    between the classification and previous inadequate groupings is
    indicated
