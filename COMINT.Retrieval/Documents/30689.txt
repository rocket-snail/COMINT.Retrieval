solution of transcendental equations by series reversion
    an algorithm is developed for expressing the solution y, of the
    equation f(y) = g(x) as a power series in (x - x0) when f and g
    are given as power series,and the root y0, is known at y=x0.
    the algorithm is illustrated for the equation y^y = x, i.e.,
    (1+y)*ln(1+y) = ln(1+x). january, 1966 thacher jr., h. c.
