school libraries and basic education in first and second
    grade schools in the state of sao paulo, brazil. discusses the
    role of the library in elementary and junior high schools as
    prescribed by brazilian state legislation, and suggests closer
    integration of school and library tasks. details are given of
    the structure of school organisation, which assigns the library
    to the category of technical support for teaching programmes
    and designates it an extra-curricular activity. criticises this
    as an inadequate conception of the library's role, and argues
    for active collaboration in the teaching process, as a back-up
    multi-media resource centre. examines the official functions of
    the library, and shows how insufficient resources are provided
    for the fulfilment of even its nominal tasks. in conclusion a
    restructuring of the school system is proposed, permitting
    total integration of library and teaching programmes at all
    levels.
