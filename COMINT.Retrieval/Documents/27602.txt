emission mechanism of cold cathode arcs a new theory is
    proposed in which excited atoms play a predominant role as a
    source for ion generation in the vicinity of the cathode
    surface the processes of resonance ionization and of ionization
    in the strong electric field at the cathode surface are
    considered
