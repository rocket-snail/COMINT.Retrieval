book week 1981 in the berlin suburb of marzahn. marzahn
    is one of the large, new urban areas in east germany. since a
    new library is not yet available, services are divided between
    4 libraries in the older part of town, a processing centre and
    several 'minilibraries' established temporarily in youth clubs,
    old people's homes, hospital premises and adult education
    centres. during book week, 31 different events for adults and
    children were organised, mainly in the libraries. the programme
    included sale of books, graphic works, ceramics and glass,
    literacy discussions at club evenings, poetry recitals, quizzes
    and bazaars, with the welcome participation of 19 different
    authors. good publicity is essential for events of this
    nature.
