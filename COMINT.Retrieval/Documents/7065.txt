community information: the library's role. (contribution
    to a debate on libraries and community information.) librarians
    make the mistake of seeing community information as being just
    another type of information, and they fall for some very basic
    fallacies: (1) the assumption that objective information is the
    only valuable information; (2) that if a little information is
    good then a lot must be better; (3) that objective information
    can be transmitted out of context; (4) that information is only
    acquired through formal information systems; (5) that
    information is relevant to all everyday needs, with an
    information solution to problems; (6) that information not now
    available can be made available; and (7) that functional units
    of information systems correspond to the functional units of
    the user.
