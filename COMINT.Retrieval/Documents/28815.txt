libraries and the non-english speaking immigrant.
    explains how australian public libraries can help non-english
    speaking immigrants to learn the language by functioning as
    clearinghouses regarding the availability of english-language
    classes and courses; stocking the appropriate learning
    material, audio-visual materials from immigrants' native
    countries (these are attuned to their experiences and can be
    presented bilingually), and copies of television and radio
    english lessons; cooperating with school libraries;
    establishing links with ethnic clubs and religious centres; and
    establishing outreach activities to publicise the library to
    traditionally non-library users.
