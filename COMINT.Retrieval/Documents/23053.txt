all libraries should be for all. argues that danish
    public libraries are no longer follow the democratic tradition
    of anglo-saxon libraries, nor do they respond to the new
    signals coming from the uk and the usa, where the social
    importance of libraries and the need for coordination of
    library services are stressed and where it is felt that
    libraries as arsenals of knowledge have the solution to man's
    global problems. in sweden too there is a tendency towards a
    unified library system. insists that all library types should
    be democratically controlled under 1 ministry; the separatist
    attitude of research libraries is therefore regrettable.
    libraries should define their users more broadly, now that the
    educational level of the population has risen and users need
    material at all levels. economic cuts necessitate a unified
    system to distribute resources. use of the new information
    technology in libraries is a question of the survival of the
    democratic library, it can revolutionise rural life an d
    education. it is society through its democratic institutions
    which must decide whether information is to be a public,
    democratically controlled, or a private concern.
