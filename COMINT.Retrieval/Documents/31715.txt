sound cassettes in the library (i). since the 1970s the
    public have made great use of the sound cassettes provided in
    libraries, which has encouraged librarians to increase stocks.
    librarians are used to coping with the relatively well
    organised book market, where lists and reviews of new
    publications are easily obtained and criteria for evaluating
    them well established. the structure of the sound cassette
    market is unfamiliar to librarians. few large firms produce
    cassettes regularly; small numbers of individual tapes are
    often produced, which disappear before they can be listed and
    reviewed. the borromeus association's library centre reviews
    new tapes to help librarians select stocks. criteria for
    evaluating tapes are not yet firmly established; assessment
    should cover the technical quality of the recording and the
    standard of the material recorded.
