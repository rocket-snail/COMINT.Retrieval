author indexing. indexing terms supplied by authors can
    increase subject control of their documents. the terms can be
    used in the creation of indexes, abstracts, and other devices
    for information retrieval in the special library. an
    examination of the american mathematical society author
    indexing programme suggests that contributions of authors
    enhance the indexing efforts of editors.
