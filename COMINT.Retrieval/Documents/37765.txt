external influences on the circuit properties of uhf
    resonators the q of a cavity resonator depends not only on its
    physical dimensions and the material of which it is made but
    also on the surface finish the influence of the material and
    its finish on the fundamental damping and resonance resistance
    is investigated for resonators of various types an examination
    is made of the degree of roughness permissible with reference
    to standard specifications on surface finishes effects due to
    variations of atmospheric temperature pressure and humidity and
    methods of eliminating these effects are also discussed
