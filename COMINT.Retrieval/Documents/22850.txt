stimulated emission of radiation by relativistic
    electrons in a ma gnetic field an expression is derived for the
    transfer of energy between an alternating electric field and
    electrons moving at right angles to a magnetic field it is
    shown that for relativistic electrons a net stimulated emission
    is possible
