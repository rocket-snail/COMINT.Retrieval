statistics of the ising ferromagnet the ising model is
    treated by synthesizing a cluster treatment with the spherical
    model which is used to determine approximately the molecular
    field acting on the cluster and the effective interactions
    between dipoles of the cluster the method is applied to the
    square net and to the cubic lattice and the critical
    temperatures are obtained
