a few words about public service, henry miller and what
    brought us to where we are. ruminates on what makes public
    librarians embark on their chosen career and suggests that each
    is engaged in writing his own version of henry miller's the
    books in my life (in which miller discusses what certain books
    and writers have meant to him). every time a patron asks a
    librarian to suggest a title, the librarian thinks back, makes
    a suggestion, writes another chapter in his version of miller's
    book, and repays the debt owed to the suggested title's author
    (for enriching the librarian's life) by keeping his words
    alive.
