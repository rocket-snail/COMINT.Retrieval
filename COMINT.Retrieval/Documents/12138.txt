a note on the analysis of vacuum tube and transistor
    circuits the setting up of node equations for a network
    containing one or more active elements is reduced essentially t
    to the determination of the admittance coefficients for the
    passive network resulting from removal of the active elements
    and adding to these the corresponding admittance coefficients
    for the active elements the latter being obtained from tables
    given in the text mesh equations are obtained in an analogous
    way using impedance coefficient tables
