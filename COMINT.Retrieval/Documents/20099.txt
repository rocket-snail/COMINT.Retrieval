extension of the generalized phase diagram method for
    studying the stability of linear systems extension of work
    reported previously a rule for interpreting the phase diagram
    leading to a simpler method of application is described the
    damping necessary to ensure stability is investigated by a
    graphical method an analytical method is developed using a
    characteristic algebraic equation with real coefficients
