cooperation between clann & abn. explores the role of
    clann, the network of 20 college, public and government special
    libraries in new south wales, in relation to the national
    library of australia's emerging australian bibliographic
    network (abn) system. the proposed service for access to
    bibliographical data conforming to national standards is
    essential to the effective economic development of the nation's
    libraries but it should be operated in such a manner as to
    encourage, maintain and support various networks and services,
    both those already existing and those that may be established
    in the future, in the library community and in the private
    sector. clann's role should be focussed on making the operation
    of the national system and of local services as effective as
    possible in meeting the needs of the libraries of new south
    wales.
