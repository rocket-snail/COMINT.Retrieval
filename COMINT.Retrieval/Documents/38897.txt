library services in rural areas of the vraca region.
    following lenin's exhortation that every citizen should have a
    library within 1.5-2 km from his place of residence, library
    services in 3 rural districts in the mountainous part of the
    vraca region are reviewed. there are about 36 localities and
    villages there, but only 3 of them have more than 2,500
    inhabitants. in spite of good public transport, provision must
    be made for people working in remote mines and on sheep farms.
    book collections in local public libraries range from
    3,000-6,000 volumes. at present annual acquisitions are on
    average 4.5 volumes per capita, against only 0.49 volume in
    1954. the target is 6.5 volumes per capita. among other
    problems discussed are the assistance of the central regional
    library in vraca, centralisation of acquisition and
    cataloguing, discarding of obsolete literature and the most
    efficient use of financial allowances.
