parallel connected nonlinear impedances analysis based on
    a matrix method of representing complex vectors and locus
    diagrams are used to determine the equivalent single impedance
    for an arbitrary system of parallel impedances values of
    voltage resulting from given current loads and of current
    resulting from given applied voltages are hence derived the
    methods are illustrated by a numerical example taking two
    nonlinear impedances with ohmic resistance components the
    complete working diagram of the parallel system is obtained by
    combining the locus diagram with the characteristic
