the stability and time response of fast operating closed
    loop pulsed radar circuits the paper deals with the stability
    and time responses of a sampling servo system typical of range
    measuring and overall feedback circuits used in pulsed radar
    equipments in which the loop response time is not many times
    greater than the pulse repetition time the case of a high speed
    radar controlled missile may be such a system conditions under
    which nyquist plots can be made are given expressions for the
    output both at and between the sampling times are obtained in
    terms of the input functions of the system the operation of the
    system in the presence of noise is considered in the appendix a
    short list of transformations suitable for analysis is
    included
