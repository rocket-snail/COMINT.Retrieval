motion of charged particles in a homogeneous magnetic
    field with superposed magnetic field of linear current and
    electric field of cylindrical capacitor the problem considered
    theoretically by kelman and rodnikova is extended to include
    the effect of a magnetic field parallel to the axia of the
    cylinder calculated results for several particular cases are
    presented graphically
