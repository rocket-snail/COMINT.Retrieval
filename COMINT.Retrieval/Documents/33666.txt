noise factor of conventional vhf amplifiers a simple
    treatment is presented the various types of circuit and valve
    noise are indicated the concept of available power is explained
    and noise factor is efined in terms of available power gain
    analysis is given for triode input stages based on common
    cathode common grid and common anode connections experimental
    results are given for various amplifiers for a mid band
    frequency of curves show the effect of source resistance on the
    midband noise factor and the variation of single frequency
    noise factor over the band and results are also tabulated for
    different valves and circuits the best noise factor with a
    given valve can only be determined experimentally the need for
    further improvement in the noise performance of valves is
    emphasized
