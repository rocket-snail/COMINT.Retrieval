effects on the f regions of the ionosphere of the solar
    eclipse of may observations indicated the development during
    the eclipse of a new layer between the f and f layers
    discontinuities of the f layer critical frequency and virtual
    height curves and of the f layer critical frequency curve were
    noted for a period of about min before and after the first
    contact estimates are made of the electron density variations
    involved
