philosopher and librarian side by side. the history of
    librarianship reveals a considerable number of librarians who
    have also been active as philosophers. it would appear that the
    librarian and the philosopher must share a number of common
    characteristics. the most striking of these characteristics is
    the unbounded thirst for knowledge. in addition, although
    courses of study are available in both disciplines, the
    knowledge and expertise of both librarian and philosopher is
    only acquired after years of experience. both groups seek to
    create order in the material which forms the focus of their
    activities and although not innovators themselves, willingly
    offer themselves in the service of others.
