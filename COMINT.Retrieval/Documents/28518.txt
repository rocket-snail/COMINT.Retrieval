the rise in the average price of monographs in public
    libraries. the survey covers only prices of monographs in east
    germany. the range and criteria for the random sample
    corresponds to the purchasing policy of a library at the 2nd
    level according to 2bibliotheksplan '731, (2library plan
    19731). the statistics show developments from 1975-79 in
    amounts spent and proportions of a total budget. from these
    figures it can be seen that 840,000 dm would have been needed
    for monograph purchase in 1980, a budget only exceeded by 17
    libraries at this level. price rises varied according to type
    of material but showed relative stability where library
    selection was concerned. from these figures the average
    expenditure required for 1982 can be calculated.
