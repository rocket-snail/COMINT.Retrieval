developments at the rutherford and appleton laboratories
    library. recent developments at the library include com
    catalogues, and the use of aere (harwell)'s text retrieval
    software package status, which is described in some detail.
    status was already on site, so (hopefully) no other costs would
    be incurred, local expertise with prime hardware was available,
    and other library systems were already using status so it could
    be assumed that some of the initial problems had already been
    solved elsewhere.
