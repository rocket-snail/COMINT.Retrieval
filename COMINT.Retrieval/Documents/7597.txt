a model for the solar enhanced region at centimeter range
    derived from partial eclipse observations records taken at
    three japanese observatories on frequencies between and during
    the partial eclipse of the sun on show a marked decrease on the
    observed flux during the period when a large sunspot group was
    eclipsed the location size and brightness distribution of the
    enhanced radiation region are derived a model for the quiet sun
    having a bright region near the limb on the equator is also
    suggested
