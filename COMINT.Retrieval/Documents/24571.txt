group processing of literature. large libraries are
    always trying to reduce the size of their catalogues and, at
    the same time, to simplify the retrieval of individual indexed
    items. the bulk of library stock must be indexed individually,
    however, there is a certain type of literature, such as
    information leaflets, promotional literature, which is suitable
    for group processing (1 catalogue card is used for a series of
    items for example). the main library of leningrad polytechnic
    prepared 'instructions for group processing of information
    literature' in 1977. the implementation of these instructions
    is discussed. it is shown that group processing of certain
    types of literature can considerably increase the effectiveness
    of cataloguing, decrease labour consumption and reduce the size
    of library catalogues.
