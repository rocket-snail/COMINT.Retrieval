radiation transfer and the possibility of negative
    absorption in radio astronomy conditions are discussed under
    which negative absorption can arise at radio wavelengths when
    the medium will behave like an amplifier to the incident
    radiations the necessary conditions can be met in cases where
    the dominant radiation process is due to the cherenkov effect
    gyro radiation or synchrotron type radiation
