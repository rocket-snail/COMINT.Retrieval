formation of the lower ionosphere the available evidence
    suggests that ions in the layer are mainly produced by photo
    ionization of photo ionization of at its first ionization
    potential should occur in the layer and further data are
    required to decide whether this layer is caused by such a
    process or by ionization by soft rays
