libraries and networks in transition: problems and
    prospects for the 1980's. librarians have learnt that
    automation is more difficult and will take longer than
    originally thought; some functions are better carried out
    through networks; although computer-based systems are more
    powerful and more versatile than the manual systems they
    replace, they can also be more expensive to operate and
    maintain (at least during the transition period); and
    computerisation imposes much higher standards of accuracy on
    library operations. discusses problems and prospects for
    libraries and networks during the next decade and suggests that
    the research libraries group, inc. (a growing partnership of 25
    libraries trying to collectively maintain and expand their
    capabilities using new technology even in the face of
    diminishing resources) could serve as a model and inspiration
    for other groups worldwide.
