transient behaviour of the ohmic contact the behaviour of
    ohmic injecting contacts is analysed for transient currents at
    a fixed voltage these occur when the free carrier density in
    the solid is changed by some exciting agent as in
    photoconductivity or bombardment induced conductivity
