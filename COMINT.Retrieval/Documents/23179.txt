library services in indonesia. as part of a programme of
    national reconstruction the government of indonesia has laid
    great emphasis on the provision of educational facilities for
    all sectors of the population. as an integral part of this
    programme the government has drawn up plans for the creation of
    a national network of library services to promote educational
    opportunities and to provide information for the cultural and
    recreational development of the individual. in 1974 the
    ministry of education and culture created the national centre
    for library services to supervise the carrying out of this
    programme. in the last 5 years a network of libraries has been
    set up throughout the country, including 19 regional library
    centres and a new national library, and 2,000 staff have
    received library training.
