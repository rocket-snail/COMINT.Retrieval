books, libraries, and scholarly traditions. adapted from
    a paper presented at the 5th annual spring conference of the
    librarians' association at the university of north carolina,
    chapel hill, 9 mar 81. argues that librarians, scholars, and
    publishers must work more closely together-despite
    specialisation, distrust, and competition for resources-during
    a period of change that could lead to a bookless world of
    scholarship.
