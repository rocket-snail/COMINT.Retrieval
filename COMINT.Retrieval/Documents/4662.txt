potential due to a uniformly charged disk formulae are
    derived applicable to any point the effect of free electron on
    lattice conduction the scattering of phonons by electrons is
    calculated assuming the usual electronphonon interaction for a
    parabolic band whose degeneracy temperature is comparable with
    the temperature of the lattice the contribution to the thermal
    resistance is given by an exact formula subject only to
    justifiable assumptions concerning phonon phonon inter actions
    with rising temperature the apparent mean free path of the
    phonons at first decreases as but reaches a minimum and then
    increases as energy and momentum conservations then allow only
    the tail of the electron distribution to contribute to the
    scattering the model is thought to apply to certain
    observations on germanium irradiated sapphire and conducting
    diamond
