the cataloging of serials in microform under aacr 2
    rules. until the publication of 2aacr 2,1 the anglo-american
    cataloging rules dictated that microform reproductions be
    catalogued under the general rules for monographs, serials,
    music, etc., the chief source of information being the title
    page of the original. 2aacr 2 1rules reverse this practice and
    separate the original from the film reproduction in the
    catalogue and in turn do a disservice to the user.
