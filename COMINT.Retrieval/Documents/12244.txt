maintain and develop the unity of the danish library
    system!. interviews the new national librarian, torkil olsen.
    he comments on some of the problems of the royal library' lack
    of space, the review of security after serious thefts, and the
    relationship between the royal library and the other 2
    university libraries in copenhagen. fears that a common course
    in librarianship will not be specialised enough for research
    libraries. supports a joint directorate for the research and
    public library sectors under the ministry of culture, but
    believes it possible to have libraries and their mother
    institutions under different ministries, and warns against
    bureaucratisation in order to achieve administrative
    unification. supports the principle of no-charge for computer
    based documentation services. hopes that cooperation between
    the danish library association and the research library
    association will be possible again. the new library act, which
    will also encompass research libraries, should help im prove
    their public image.
