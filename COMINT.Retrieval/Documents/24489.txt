anatomy of failure' ontario mechanics' institutes,
    1835-1895. discusses the rise and fall of mechanics' institutes
    in ontario. the institutes were originally intended to provide
    technical education for mechanics to make them better workers,
    better people and better citizens. they failed in this largely
    because what the government intended them to provide was not
    what was needed by the people that they served. workers and
    apprentices did not attend classes in large numbers because
    they were probably exhausted after a 10 or 11 hour day. through
    legislation the institutes were converted to free public
    libraries.
