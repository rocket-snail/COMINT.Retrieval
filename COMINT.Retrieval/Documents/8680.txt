helical fields simple analytic helically invariant
    solutions of the laplace equation are given and combined to
    describe the e s field of a charged helix and the magnetic
    field of a helical electric current certain graphical flux
    plotting methods are out lined and illustrated and network
    analogies are suggested for solving these fields
