the density of the earths outer atmosphere according to
    satellite observations orbital data of satellites and are used
    to determine atmospheric density above km results agree closely
    with those obtained from observations of satellites and
    retardation effects are also discussed measurement of the
    concentration of positive ions along the orbit of an artificial
    earth satellite the surface potential of a satellite and the
    distribution of charged particles around it are discussed
    instruments for measuring the ion concentration and the
    transmission of results to earth by radio telemetry are
    described graphs of the air temperature a t different heights
    are also shown references
