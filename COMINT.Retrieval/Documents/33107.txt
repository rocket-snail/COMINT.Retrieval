non-legal reference books for law libraries. update to,
    and expansion of, a bibliography produced by j. myron
    jacobstein, and published in law libr. j. (feb 60). the
    bibliography is divided into 2 sections: the 1st includes
    'permanent' titles-those updated irregularly and infrequently
    and which therefore do not involve ongoing expense; the 2nd
    includes periodicals, services, annuals and biennial works;
    many of the latter group have permanent value and involve an
    ongoing and predictable commitment of library funds. all listed
    titles are currently in print and readily available from
    ordinary sources.
