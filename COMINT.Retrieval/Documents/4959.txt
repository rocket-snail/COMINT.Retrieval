radio emission from the andromeda nebula observations
    have been made at a wavelength of with interferometers of
    different resolving powers to determine the distribution of
    radio brightness accross the nebula the results suggest the
    existence of a hitherto unexpected population of radio sources
    a similar population in our own galaxy might also account for a
    large part of the so called isotropic component of cosmic radio
    emission
