a reversible secondary emission fatigue effect observed
    in glow cathodes comprising a semiconducting layer if the usual
    metallic cathode in a glow discharge tube is replaced by a
    composite cathode having a semiconducting layer eg an cathode
    the self maintained discharge current decreases with time when
    the current density does not exceed a particular value
    dependent on cathode geometry an when the cell is kept in the
    dark recovery takes place slowly but is speeded up if the cell
    is subjected to infrared radiation th effect is ascribed to
    reversible fatigue of the emission centres for secondary
    electrons and the analogous effect observed with photocathodes
    suggests that both photons and secondary electrons originate in
    the same emission centres
