on the 10th anniversary of the netherlands bibliotheek en
    lektuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and literature)'
    the chairman's turn to speak (part) 2. text of an interview
    with dr. j.j. postma, chairman of the nblc on the 10th
    anniversary of the founding of the centre. postma believes that
    librarians in the netherlands should now come to terms with the
    new public services act, which will replace the existing public
    libraries act. by refusing to accept the act librarians are in
    danger of being left out in the cold. in postma's view the
    danger of the new act lies in the devolution of responsibility
    for the public services, including public libraries, from
    national to local government. in some local authorities, he
    adds, town festivals may receive greater priority than the
    library service. the nblc must convince the government of the
    need for an information act which includes the public library
    service. (for an abstract of part 1, 2see1 82/5007).
