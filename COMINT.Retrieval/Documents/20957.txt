selected results from a study of astronomy document flow,
    with special reference to the 2astronomiya1 abstracting serial.
    the serials and periodicals covered by the soviet abstracting
    journal 2astronomiya1 in 1973 are ranked by productivity and
    the distribution obtained is shown to be described by kendall's
    formulation of the zipf-bradford law. core and near-core titles
    are identified. titles identified as being totally
    astronomy-oriented account for 25% of the titles covered.
    distribution of publications by language and country of origin
    is also analysed. emphasises the importance of prompt
    abstracting of publications and proposes a quantitative
    criterion to measure the speed with which abstracts are
    published. concludes that document flow in astronomy is typical
    of that of fundamental sciences.
