processes controlling ionization distribution in the
    region of the ionosphere rocket measurements at heights
    approaching suggest that the atmospheric density in the region
    may be some times less than previously deduced from radio
    experiments if the new value were correct diffusion of
    ionization under the forces of gravity and of its own pressure
    gradient would be likely to affect the shape and height of the
    region notably an investigation was made of the possible
    effects of diffusion processes at such levels the results
    indicate that a region with arbitrary height distribution of
    ionization will by diffusion assume the form of a chapman
    region after a time which for levels is a few hours if the
    radio determinations of density are correct but only a few
    minutes if the rocket determinations are correct it is
    suggested that there must be a systematic error in the rocket
    observations
