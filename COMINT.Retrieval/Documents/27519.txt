the vertical distribution of electrical conductivity in
    the upper atmosphere data obtained from rocket measurements are
    used to determine the vertical distribution of conductivity and
    its height integrated values for the d e and f regions the
    greatest conductivity value is found for the e layer around
    hence this region is probably the seat of the electrical
    currents producing diurnal magnetic variations
