series resonant circuit theory expressions are derived
    for the fractional errors in tuning capacitance resonance
    frequency maximum current and selectivity at current resonance
    due in the case of frequency tuning to the frequency dependence
    of the circuit resistance and in the case of capacitance tuning
    to capacitor losses and coil self capacitance
