second order nonlinear systems in these systems where
    time is not explicitly shown the four space is split into a
    displacement subspace and a velocity subspace the two being
    related by a hypercone in a transformation singularities of
    integral curves and certain shock phenomena are discussed and
    the analysis is applied to two types of multivibrator
