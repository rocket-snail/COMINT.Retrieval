ionospheric absorption at times of auroral and magnetic
    pulsations variations in auroral absorption during march and
    april were closely related o to magnetic field micropulsations
    and short period intensity changes at the amplitudes of the
    magnetic micropulsations were diminished during periods of
    polar cap type absorption
