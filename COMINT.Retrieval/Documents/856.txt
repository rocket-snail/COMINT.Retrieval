reflexions from irregularities in the ionosphere
    complexities in records of and for the f region are shown to be
    due to curvature of the reflecting surface the order of
    curvature associated with travelling disturbances is calculated
    and the variation in the type of complexity is shown to result
    from differing group retardations in the different paths a base
    triangular system of three pulse transmitters and a panoramic
    type recorder were used respectively for and recording
