inductive elements for solid state circuits a resonant
    circuit is described in which a ge diffused base transistor
    with an open circuit base connection functions as a negative
    resistance diode with an effective inductance of fifteen uh the
    low frequency noise generated by the diode is attributed to
    avalanche multiplication occurring in localized non stationary
    areas
