synthesis of constant time delay ladder networks using
    bessel polynomials a low pass minimum phase transfer function
    is constructed which produces a ma imally flat time delay
    frequency characteristic and a nearly gaussian impulse response
    evaluation of delay and loss characteristics is simplified
    since the transfer function can b expressed in terms of
    tabulated function synthesis of the corresponding ladder
    network using low elements is described characteristics of a
    class of related non minimum phase transfer functions are also
    discussed
