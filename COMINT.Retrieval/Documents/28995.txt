the uniqueness of the solutions in the rigorous theory of
    diffraction the solutions previously given by honl of not only
    satisfy the usual conditions but also meet the requirement that
    no subsidiary wave fields be radiated from the edges of the
    aperture so that the uniqueness of the solutions is
    established
