measuring library services-to cut costs?. describes the
    process of measuring the quality of public library services,
    particularly in the light of the british government's intention
    to introduce a process whereby local government must disclose
    information about its costs and performance to the public, with
    the result that expenditure by local authorities is reduced to
    the lowest spending authority's level, and not to the level of
    the authority providing the highest quality services. measures
    should reflect the desired outcome of the services offered, and
    librarian's attempts to audit their work will improve their
    understanding of what they are trying to do for society.
