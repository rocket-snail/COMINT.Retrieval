satellite orbits and atmospheric densities at altitudes
    obtained from the vanguard orbit determination program the
    program is outlined results of vanguard one measurements show
    that the minitrack and computing systems can be operated with
    an overall accuracy within one milliradian atmospheric density
    results are discussed
