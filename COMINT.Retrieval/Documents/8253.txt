the shape of the geomagnetic field boundary under uniform
    external pressure the shape of the cavity separating the
    geomagnetic field from the inteplanetary plasma is calculated
    numerically for an idealized model in which the plasma pressure
    is assumed to be constant over the surface of the cavity
