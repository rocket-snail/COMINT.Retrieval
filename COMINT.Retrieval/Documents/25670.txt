the reaction field and its use in some solid state
    amplifiers the theory of the maser is presented in terms of the
    radiation reaction field produced in a cavity or waveguide by
    the presence of the electromagnetic moment of the sample being
    investigated two amplifiers are discussed which use the
    reaction field in different ways from the usual solid state
    maser
