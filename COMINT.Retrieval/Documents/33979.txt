veneto' towards a policy line for libraries. an analysis
    of the problems besetting the organisation and operation of
    library services in a north italian region, in relation to
    independent proposals for a total restructuring of the system.
    the actual and potential roles of each component are examined
    in detail' the state and its responsibility for a national
    library network; the region and the need for legal intervention
    to create a basis for an effective library system; celbiv, the
    regional publishers' cooperative serving public and school
    libraries, and the need to capitalise on the resources it
    offers; the province and the organisation of comprehensive
    services; and the town, with particular reference to projected
    improvements in venice. an appendix contains the recent
    proposals from celbiv to establish a bibliographical service to
    public and school libraries, covering children's books only,
    which would include cataloguing services and an information
    centre.
