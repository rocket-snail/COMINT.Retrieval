training and education of library instruction librarians.
    contribution to a thematic issue on library use instruction.
    discusses the development of the bibliographic instruction (bi)
    movement in us libraries, and describes the thrust of the bi
    education effort over the past decade as it emanates from
    continuing education. reviews briefly the contribution of ala
    related bibliographic programmes to the development of the
    bibliographic instruction concept. considers some reasons for
    the resistance of library schools to adding courses that would
    train prospective teachers for bibliographic instruction, and
    expresses the hope that recognition of the need for formal
    training for the teaching librarian or the teacher of
    bibliography will strengthen the role of the library in the
    institutional setting.
