a section without a past' on the 40th anniversary of the
    section for special libraries of the dutch association of
    librarians, documentalists and information scientists. the
    formation of the special libraries section of the nederlandse
    vereniging van bibliothecarissen, documentalisten en
    literatuuronderzoekers (dutch association of librarians,
    documentalists and information scientists) in the netherlands
    in 1941 was due largely to the efforts of dr. l.j. van der
    wolk, librarian of the nitrogen products division of the state
    mines in limburg. at van der wolk's suggestion, membership of
    the section was originally restricted to staff of commercial
    and industrial libraries. the first committee meeting of the
    section was held in the state mines central laboratory at
    geleen on 17 sept 41 and the 1st meeting of members on 29 oct
    following in the park hotel, amsterdam. membership of the
    section has grown from 204 in 1948 to 760 in 1980.
