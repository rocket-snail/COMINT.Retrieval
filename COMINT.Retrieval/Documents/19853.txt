the problem of the optical constants of conductors a
    mathematical analysis showing that the optical constants of an
    isotropic conductor comprise in addition to the index of
    refraction and of the absorption coefficient two real
    quantities corresponding to a complex boundary impedance the
    real part of this boundary impedance represents the surface
    losses in the conductor and the imaginary part of the
    dielectric constant the volume losses
