variable-precision exponentiation a previous paper
    presented an efficient algorithm, called the recomputation
    algorithm, for evaluating a rational expression to within any
    desired tolerance on a computer which performs
    variable-precision arithmetic operations. the recomputation
    algorithm can be applied to expressions involving any
    variable-precision operations having o(10^(-p) + sum{|ei|})
    error bounds, where p denotes the operation's precision and ei
    denotes the error in the operation's ith argument. this paper
    presents an efficient variable-precision exponential operation
    with an error bound of the above order. other operations such
    as log, sin, and cos, which have simple series expansions, can
    be handled similarly. january, 1973 richman, p. l.
