electrodynamics of moving media and the theory of the
    cerendov effect the generalized frank andtamms formula fot the
    total energy radiated as cerenkov radiation by a swiftly moving
    charged particle in a medium of dielectric constant and
    permeability has been derived employing the invariance of the
    phenomenological electrodynamic equations of maxwell the scheme
    is self consistent and the idea of the indetectability of the
    ether wind is contained in it it is found that the cerenkov
    radiation is times larger than that predicted by the frank and
    tamms formula for experiments are suggested to detect strong
    cerenkov radiation in highly permeable mediums
