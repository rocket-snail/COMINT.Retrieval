problems of document delivery for the euronet user. a
    franklin institute gmbh, munich, technical report prepared for
    the commission of the european communities directorate general
    for scientific and technical information and information
    management. its purpose was to throw light on the requirements,
    problems and possible solutions concerning document ordering
    and delivery through euronet/diane. many classes of individual
    and organisation were interviewed, revealing a level of demand
    of 6 million documents annually which is increasing at a rate
    of 4-10% per year. euronet on-line searching could have a
    dramatic effect on these figures, accounting for 50% of the
    increase in demand. present document supply centres appear to
    be operating at capacity and as automated ordering service
    could be highly beneficial.
