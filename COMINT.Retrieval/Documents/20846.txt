plasma density fluctuations in a magnetic field a
    continuation of earlier work in which the frequency spectrum
    was derived for the spatial fourier transform of the electron
    charge density fluctuations in a plasma the effects of a
    constant magnetic field in an arbitrary direction are
    considered a theoretical basis is provided for analysing back
    scatter experiments and intensities are derived a function of
    the real frequency variable for the case of thermodynamic
    equilibrium
