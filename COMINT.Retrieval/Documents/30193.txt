coupled lines as high frequency transformer systems
    comprising two parallel two conductor lines r are considered
    voltage and current distribution and input impedance are
    calculated in terms of terminating impedance overlap length and
    coupling an indication is given of the requirements to be
    satisfied for wide band operation and some particular
    arrangements are discussed
