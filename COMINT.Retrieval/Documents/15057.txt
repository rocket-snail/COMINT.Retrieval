scientific and technical libraries and interlending
    schemes. scientific and technical libraries are leaders in the
    field of interlibrary lending in bulgaria. a survey carried out
    in 53 scientific and technical libraries in the period 1977-79
    showed an increase in interlending partners, ranging on average
    from 6-9, but some libraries maintaining contacts with 14, 20,
    or even 27 counterparts. international interlending was
    slightly under 10%, and interlending from central regional
    libraries only 5%. the greatest demand was for periodicals,
    catalogues and patents, followed by books and translations.
    during the survey, librarians put forward many useful
    suggestions for improvement, directed most frequently at the
    central technical library and/or at the cyril and methodius
    national library.
