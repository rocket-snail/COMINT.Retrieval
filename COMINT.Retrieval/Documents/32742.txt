access to patent information and documentation in public
    patent libraries. summarises the results of a 1980 study made
    for the commission of the european communities. the objective
    was to study the organisation of public patent libraries and on
    this basis (supplemented with interviews with experts) to draft
    recommendations for the improvement of access to material in
    such libraries. the patent offices of west germany and france,
    european patent office, science reference library in london,
    and patent libraries or information centres in nuremberg,
    liverpool, lyon, strasbourg, and toulouse were visited. the
    most important problem areas identified were identification of
    user's needs, extent of documentation needed, publicity
    programmes, location of patent information centres, and
    organisation and staffing of such centres.
