heights of irregularities giving rise to the fading of
    waves a calculation is made of the relation between phase and
    amplitude for a wave propagated through a region of random
    absorption below the reflection level results agree with those
    obtained experimentally a method for estimating particle
    collision frequency in the absorbing region is presented based
    on that of from which data regarding the region may be
    deduced
