a microdatabase for online search training. a
    microcomputer emulation is being designed to enable students to
    practise on-line searching without incurring high connect
    costs. the emulation works on a data base of around 100 records
    including author, title, journal, language, abstract and
    descriptor fields. the main lockheed dialog commands are
    emulated including full text searching and truncation as well
    as select, combine, type, etc. it is also intended to include
    diagnostics in the package, enabling the searcher to solicit
    help from the system if it is felt that the search is becoming
    unstructured or failing in intent. the programme will also
    interrupt the search to issue warnings if an adequate search
    strategy does not appear to be developing. as part of the
    package a secondary programme will facilitate the
    semi-automatic creation of additional microdata bases.
