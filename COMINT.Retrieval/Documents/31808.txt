effect of moving striations on microwave conductivity of
    a coaxial discharge experiments were made with a discharge tube
    arranged so that part of the discharge path fills a gap along
    the inner conductor of a coaxial line the results indicate a
    marked variation of the microwave conductivity as striations
    move past the gap the effect may be strong enough to use for
    switching purposes
