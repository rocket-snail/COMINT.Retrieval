ghana and uap' obstacles and prospects. since
    independence, ghana's book industry has received a great deal
    of encouragement from the state to develop a viable modern
    indigenous infrastructure. its progress has been hampered by
    deteriorating economic and other factors. low literacy is
    slowing down the spread of the book culture, and combined with
    obstructive indifference of officials, access to and
    availability of indigenous publications are proving difficult.
    libraries are facing enormous obstacles in their attempts to
    improve the situation. action at the national and international
    levels is a possible solution to the promotion of uap
    (universal availability of publications).
