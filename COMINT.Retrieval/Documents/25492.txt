theory of molecular oscillator and molecular power
    amplifier theory is given of a device similar to that described
    by gordon et al of january the condition for self excitation is
    stated and expressions are given for the frequency amplitude
    and maximum power output of the oscillator and for the power
    amplification factor and the condition for linear amplification
    of the amplifier
