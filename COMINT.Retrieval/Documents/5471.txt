fundamental problems of hf and if amplifiers for tv
    reception part feedback and practical considerations following
    on the theory a detailed discussion is presented of the effects
    in television amplifiers of fedback via the cathode grid
    capacitance via the anode grid capacitance via the anode
    cathode capacitance the necessary formulae are derived for an
    amplifying stage in which all three types of feedback are
    present x so that their interactions can be investigated
    theoretically the detailed discussion is however confined to
    systems in which only one form of feedback is present the
    theory is illustrated by practical examples in amplifier
    design
