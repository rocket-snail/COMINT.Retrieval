did the new building come up to the expectations of the
    staff?. all the library departments of the new jyvaskyla
    central library, finland, are at the same level. due to the
    openness of the building guiding is easier, but this open plan
    also exaggerates noise. the new building has brought more
    customers to the library because it is large and multi-purpose.
    on the whole the staff is very pleased with the general design
    of the building. includes plans of the 4 floors of the
    building.
