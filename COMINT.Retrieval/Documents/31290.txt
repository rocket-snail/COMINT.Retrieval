transient operation of low pass and high pass lattice
    filters an expression is derived for the admittance of the
    lattice filter terminated by its characteristic impedance
    functions using a new inverse transformation method the unit
    step response of some low pass filters and the unit function
    response of some high pass filters are determined a simple
    method is indicated for determining the response to an
    arbitrary voltage
