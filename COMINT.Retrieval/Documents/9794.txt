pica (project geintegreerde catalogus automatisering) at
    the start of the 1980s. in 1977 the pica (project for
    integrated catalogue automation) system became operational in
    the netherlands. the pica network is the result of an agreement
    concluded by the dutch government and universities in 1969. in
    addition a number of other libraries, including leeuwaarden
    county library and the public libraries of amsterdam and the
    hague are members of the network as 'customer' libraries.
    overall supervision of the network is maintained by the pica
    bureau located in the royal library. member libraries
    contribute catalogue records via on-line visual display
    terminals direct to the central data base, from which output
    may be obtained in the form of catalogue cards, paper printout
    or microfiche. in 1982 the central data base will be adapted
    for use in acquisition and loans control systems and in 1983
    will be used for the national interlibrary-lending
    network.
