terminology documentation in german standards through the
    construction of a terminology databank. the german standards
    institute has collected 30,000 standard terminological
    definitions and a further 30,000 subject terms not yet
    standardised, through the work of over 100 committees. the only
    way to produce a clear, comprehensive survey of their work
    would be by constructing a terminology data bank which must
    provide access possibilities for terms and sources, references
    to synonyms, discarded terms and foreign language equivalents,
    links with the dinst alteration services and assistance in the
    compilation of subject dictionaries and a thesaurus on standard
    documentation. a pilot project on information and documentation
    terminology has proved successful; a data bank covering all
    standard terminology could be produced in 2-3 years.
