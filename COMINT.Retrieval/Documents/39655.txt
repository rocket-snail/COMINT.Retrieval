methods for predicting the orbits of near earth
    satellites methods are described for predicting the times and
    positions of the daily transits of a satellite and the geometry
    of its orbit the methods depend upon maintaining an accurate
    record of the period of revolution from which the other orbital
    elements are deduced theoretically
