electrothermal convection in air the effect of an
    inhomogeneous electric field on the thermal gradients in air
    was investigated using air heated electrically by a filament of
    length cm along the axis of a glass tube of diameter about cm
    results show that the field required to produce electrothermal
    convection is lower at high power dissipation than at low
    dissipation in the range the transition between gravitational
    thermal and electrothermal convection occurs discontinuously
    the potential difference between the positive filament and
    negative electrodes placed on either side of the filament was
    varied between about and interference photographs are shown and
    the apparatus used is described results are presented
    graphically
