variations in the orbit of the echo satellite minitrack
    observations of the echo satellite show that owing to the suns
    radiation pressure the perigee distance and eccentricity of the
    orbit are varying at rates which are in good agreement with the
    theoretical rates the observations also lead to a value for
    atmospheric density at a height of km
