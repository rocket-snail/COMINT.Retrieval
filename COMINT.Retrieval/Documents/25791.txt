local library periodicals. cooperation and coordination
    for the improvement of literature supply are the essential
    aspects of the local library systems which were set up in the
    individual libraries in the wake of the university reform.
    however, the new structures require a degree of current and
    continuous exchange of information between the various parts of
    library systems. local library journals can contribute
    considerably to communication on the premises. they make the
    library systems intelligible and they serve continuing
    education and strengthen the contacts between libraries. as
    they promote cooperation by the interlocking and supply of
    administrative processes, they provide further rationale for
    cooperation in local library systems.
