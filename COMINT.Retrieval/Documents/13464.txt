the dynamic public library. a practical discussion of the
    public library's role as an agent for social and cultural
    improvement in the community. to attract readers, the librarian
    must design services to meet local needs and interests; here,
    contact with local community leaders is essential. to project a
    dynamic image, services must be manifestly relevant and
    efficient, and geared not only to existing users but also to
    non-users. emphasises that the library's priority is to
    counteract general public apathy by bold initiatives; suggests
    various strategies for drawing public attention, and concludes
    with a detailed plan for organising a national library week,
    along the lines of the latin american national book week, to
    highlight public library activities and services.
