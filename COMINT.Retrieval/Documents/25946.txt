demand-adjusted shelf availability parameters. a measure
    of library performance is the probability that the patron can
    find the material sought. this parameter, document
    availability, is best measured by sampling the expressed
    demand. sampling the shelf-list is far less intrusive, but
    fails to provide data on collection adequacy, user catalogue
    and shelf skills, and factors inhibiting availability (such as
    circulation). describes a simple technique for adjusting
    shelf-list data to reflect expressed demand results and
    presents a worked example, explaining the steps
    involved.
