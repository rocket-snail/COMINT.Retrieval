isocline diagrams for transistor circuits the method
    described for the graphical analysis of transistor negative
    resistance oscillators is based on nonlinear mechanics and does
    not necessitate approximation of curved transistor
    characteristics by straight lines voltage and current
    trajectories can be obtained by a simple construction which
    also indicates the rate of change of the voltages and currents
    during the course of cycllic or transient phenomena
