on the seasonal and nonseasonal annual variations and the
    semiannual variation in the noon and midnight electron
    densities of the layer in middle latitudes part two previous
    work is continued using two groups of relatively high and low
    latitude stations the seasonal variation for the high latitude
    stations is markedly different from that of the low latitude
    group while the nonseasonal variations do not show great
    differences between the groups the semi annual variations in
    the two graphs are also not markedly different
