the movements of sporadic e layer clouds the drift speed
    of isolated clouds was measured by observing the beat between a
    ground wave signal from a cw transmitter and the sky wave
    reflected from the moving cloud comparison of these
    observations made at night with other evidence suggests that
    scattering is greater than in the day a method for determining
    the direction of drift is suggested
