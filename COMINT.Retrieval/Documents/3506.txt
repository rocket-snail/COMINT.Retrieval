electron density in a nonisothermal ionosphere
    continuation of work noted previously of electron density when
    the earths curvature is taken into account may be appreciable
    especially for the winter the corresponding difference in
    critical frequency may amount to for the period just after
    sunrise comparison of calculated and observed values of
    suggests that a representative model of an region can be based
    on the assumption that the temperature varies linearly with
    height up to the interface and then remains constant the
    parabolic law of variation of electron density is acceptable
    only for heights corresponding to reflection frequencies not
    less than times the critical frequency a general expression is
    derived relating temperature electron density density of matter
    recombination coefficient and adsorption coefficient
