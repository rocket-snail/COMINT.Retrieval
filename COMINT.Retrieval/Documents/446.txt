multiple coincidence circuit a general purpose transistor
    coincidence circuit accepting up to five input signals with
    three simultaneous outputs is described it features a special
    discriminator which operates on the leading edge of the input
    signals or the passage through zero on the trailing edge the
    discriminator bias can be varied over a wide range without
    affecting the circuit recovery time
