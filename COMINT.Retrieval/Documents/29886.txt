the reflection and screening effects of metallic
    enclosures in a plane electromagnetic wave three cases of
    reflection and screening action are investigations for
    wavelengths of the order of the dimensions of the enclosure a
    hollow cylinder with axis parallel to the electric field a
    hollow cylinder with axis parallel to the magnetic field and a
    hollow sphere the increase of the reflection coefficient with
    rising frequencies screen attenuation and resonance effects are
    discussed
