winds in the upper atmosphere deduced from the dynamo
    theory of geomagnetic disturbance simple dynamo theory of winds
    moving along and perpendicular to the geomagnetic field is
    developed and various wind systems are discussed which might
    account for certain phases of magnetic storms a possible wind
    system for the main phase of a magnetic storm shows some
    measure of agreement with diurnal atmospheric motions deduced
    from radio star scintillations and auroral motions the role of
    such wind systems in modifying the effective transverse
    conductivity of the ionosphere is uncertain both the flux of x
    rays producing ionization and the dynamo airflow in the e
    region are apparently the same on days of magnetic storms as on
    days prior to them
