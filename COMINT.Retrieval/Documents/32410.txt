the resources and technical services division at
    twenty-five. the resources and technical services division
    (rtsd) of the american library association has had a productive
    25 years. although it has encountered organisational issues at
    both association and division levels, its areas of
    responsibility and its structure have remained the same since
    1957. rtsd members have been active in all areas of division
    responsibility. standards, publishing and continuing education
    have been especially strong programmes. the prognosis for the
    division's future is good because it is strengthening
    programmes that support its 1979 goals.
