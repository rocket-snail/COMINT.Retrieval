the design and operation of transistor converters
    circuits are discussed in which a junction transistor is made
    to oscillate and thus to chop the current from a battery the
    chopped current is fed to a transformer or ringing choke and
    the stepped up voltage output is rectified and smoothed design
    procedures are described in detail see also of
