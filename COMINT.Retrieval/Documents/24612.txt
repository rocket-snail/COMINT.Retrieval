diffraction of electromagnetic waves by two parallel half
    planes the field of a plane wave diffracted by the edges of two
    parallel conducting sheets has been measured close to the
    diffracting edges for various spacings between the sheets
    experimental results for a spacing of one wavelength are
    compared with values derived from theory presented by clemmow
    of the agreement is satisfactory
