frequency conversion with positive nonlinear resistors
    positive nonlinear resistors are defined as two terminal
    devices through which the current is a real finite single
    valued nondecreasing function of the voltage across the
    terminals with the added condition that when subjected to an
    almost periodic voltage such a resistor will absorb power at
    some frequencies and supply power at other frequencies analysis
    indicates that modulation efficiency cannot exceed unity that
    subharmonics are not produced and that the efficiency of
    generating an harmonic cannot exceed
