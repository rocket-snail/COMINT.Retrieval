space charge effects in a high frequency discharge
    details of experimental work on the effect reported in of the
    current flowing in a circuit connecting the external electrodes
    and including a high resistance r is measured and its relation
    to the applied voltage and to the pd between the internal
    electrodes examined when r is very high discontinuities in the
    characteristic and hysteresis effects are observed with change
    in applied voltage the latter are studied in further detailed
    oscillograms a theoretical explanation of the results is
    discussed
