dial-a-slide service for producers. describes the visual
    resources system developed by the uk company martak for its
    collection of over 50,000 slides. a customer's requirements are
    run against the computerised index and the computer selects and
    displays details of the most appropriate slide. a copy of the
    slide is made and despatched. most users are producers of
    tape/slide presentations. martak is hoping to service the
    collections of other companies and is to market a less complex
    version of the software, enabling companies to sort out their
    collections themselves.
