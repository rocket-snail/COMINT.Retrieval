coaxial resonator filters from an analysis of an
    equivalent band pass circuit an expression is derived for
    insertion loss in terms of the loaded and unloaded q factors
    and the electrical design parameters are related to the
    dimensions of the coupling loops the insertion loss
    characteristic of n identical resonators in tandem is
    determined by considering shunt susceptances equally spaced
    along a transmission line an alignment procedure and
    arrangements for frequency multiplexing are described
