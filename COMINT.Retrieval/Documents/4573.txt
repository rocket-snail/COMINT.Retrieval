compensation against effects of grid cathode capacitance
    in pulse height selectors the precision of the selector may be
    reduced by an effect due to the grid cathode capacitance of the
    input valve when a constant current valve is used in the
    cathode circuit this effect can be compensated by applying the
    input signal appropriately modified to the grid of the constant
    current valve
