an amplitude stabilized transistor oscillator an af
    oscillator using two junction transistors in push pull class c
    operation has its amplitude stabilized to within over wide
    ranges of supply voltage loading and temperature by comparing
    the output with a stable reference voltage obtained from a
    junction diode operated at breakdown
