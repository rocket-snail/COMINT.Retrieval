the smoothing of loss attenuation in basic types of
    ladder filter the characteristics of basic and terminating half
    sections with losses are derived from image parameter theory
    and the results applied to show how the attenuation can be
    smoothed by introducing mismatch at the end of the end of the
    filter or by inserting series and or shunt resistors at
    properly chosen points within the network
