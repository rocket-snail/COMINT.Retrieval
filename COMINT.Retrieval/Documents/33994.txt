the effect of radiation on silicon solar energy
    converters the solar cells are unaffected by irradiation with
    ultraviolet light and x rays high energy electrons protons and
    particles produce a time decay in such characteristics as
    maximum power output open circuit voltage and short circuit
    current the lifetime of the cells to of the initial power
    output is estimated to be years when exposed to the radiations
    assumed to exist at earth satellite orbit heights
