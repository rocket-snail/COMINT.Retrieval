intermediate layers of ionization between the e and f
    layers of the ionosphere over ahmedabad n e observations are
    reported indicating the regular occurrence of two intermediate
    layers with virtual heights of km and km respectively both
    layers exhibit magneto ionic splitting the variation of the
    critical frequencies with the suns zenithal angle obeys a cos
    law the value of n being about true heights and thickness of
    the layers are determined for some cases the values of true
    heights are in good agreement with rocket observations
