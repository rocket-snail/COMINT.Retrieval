correlation studies of radio aurora magnetic and earth
    current disturbances the diurnal variation of the rate of
    auroral echo occurrence appears to be similar to that of
    moderate perturbations of h a relation is suggested between
    magnetic perturbations and the reversal of direction of auroral
    ionization drift from west to east at about local
