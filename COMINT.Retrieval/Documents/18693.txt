the motion of magnetic fields the temporal change of a
    magnetic field cannot b described as a motion if it involves
    interlinking of the lines of force it is shown that the idea of
    motion can be retained if the lines of force are regarded as
    being disconnected on a suitable surface a process is described
    by which magnetic flux can be generated other than at a neutral
    line
