the method of secondary quantization in phase space a
    statistical analysis of systems of interacting particles in
    which use is made of the number of particles in various points
    of coordinate momentum phase space which at every point of
    phase space are random functions of time this method can be
    used for considering particles and fields in electromagnetic
    interaction
