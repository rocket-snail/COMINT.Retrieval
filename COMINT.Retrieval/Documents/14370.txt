the public library as promoter of techno-fascism' the
    (anti-)social consequences of automation. modern society is
    dominated by science and technology. however, insufficient
    attention has been paid to the social implications of
    automation. the professional organisations of librarianship in
    the netherlands have undertaken no studies of the social
    implications on their members' behalf apart from the
    netherlands bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for
    libraries and literature), which in 1979 formed a committee to
    investigate ways of protecting the privacy of the individual
    against the misuse of personal information in computerised
    systems. however, the recommendations of the committee were
    rejected in 1980 by nblc members as too radical. automation
    will lead to a reduction in the number of posts in libraries at
    all levels and librarians must act now to prevent a further
    deterioration in the situation.
