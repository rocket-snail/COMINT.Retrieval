practical low pass and band pass minimum phase networks
    with equalized delay and a period transient response a minimum
    phase shift network with constant delay characteristic is a
    practical approximation to an idealized low pass filter since
    its attenuation characteristic in the pass band has a similar
    shape conditions for delay equalization are investigated for a
    unit step input in terms of the positions of the zeros and
    poles of the response function a general method of calculation
    for filter networks of this type is given the attenuation and
    group delay characteristics in a simple case are compared with
    those of an equivalent filter based on image parameter
