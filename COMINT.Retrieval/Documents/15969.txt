a circuit for analogue formation of a quarter squares
    multiplier using a triangle carrier waveform in the squaring
    circuits is extended to give division simultaneously with
    multiplication this is achieved by controlling the slope of the
    triangle carrier waveform so as to be proportional to the
    divisor z
