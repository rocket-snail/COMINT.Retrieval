breakdown of a gas subject to crossed electric fields
    experiments with various gases show that breakdown in a
    resonator subjected to voltage pulses with a repetition
    frequency of is not helped by application of alternating fields
    of frequency or perpendicular to the main field even when such
    fields are only a little below the value at which they would
    cause breakdown if acting alone
