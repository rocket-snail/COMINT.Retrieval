the solar eclipse of at gao ionosphere observations made
    during the eclipse are reported though the occultation was only
    partial a diminution of e and f layer ionization compared with
    normal days was observed the effect was very pronounced at
    hours when the sunspot near the western limb of the sun was
    obscured on the other hand when this sunspot disappeared on
    february as a result of the rotation of the sun there was no
    noticeable reduction of the e layer ionization the effect is
    difficult to explain in terms of classical theory the
    diminution of ionization of the f layer is significant
