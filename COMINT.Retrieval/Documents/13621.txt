magneto ionic theory for a fully ionized hydrogen plasma
    the effects of electron proton and electron electron collisions
    on the real refractive index and the absorptivity are evaluated
    for electromagnetic wave propagation in a fully ionized
    hydrogen plasma under the influence of an external magnetic
    field the appleton hartree magneto ionic formula as generally
    applied to the solar ionosphere is retrieved in a limiting case
    with the conventionally adopted expression for the effective
    electron proton collision frequency electron electron
    collisions are significant only in the realm of gyro resonance
    where they diminish the absorptivity due to electron proton
