materials for optical storage' a state-of-the-art survey.
    the ideal specifications of recording material for optical data
    storage systems are discussed, with particular reference to
    cost, availability and toxicity. consideration is given to
    various types of materials known to be under development' thin
    metal films, organic dyes, metal-impregnated polymers,
    photographic film, electrophotographic materials, photochromics
    and magneto-optics.
