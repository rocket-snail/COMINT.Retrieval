electrohydromagnetic waves in a fully ionized gas part
    the appleton hartree dispersion formula for magneto ionics is
    generalized to include the effect of heavy ions the ratio of
    particle energy to magnetic field energy in a wave of arbitrary
    frequency is determined a band of frequencies around the plasma
    frequency is found for which waves are attenuated location of
    these bands would enable the interplanetary magnetic field and
    electron density to be estimated
