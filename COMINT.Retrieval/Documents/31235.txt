the conductivity tensor of electron plasmas in the
    presence of a constant magnetic field assuming the mean
    collision frequency to be independent of velocity it is shown
    that the form of the ct of velocity it is shown that the form
    of the conductivity tensor given by jacel and kahan above
    differs from that given by huxley of in order to represent the
    magnetoresistance terms correctly by jancel and kahans method
    closer approximation is necessary
