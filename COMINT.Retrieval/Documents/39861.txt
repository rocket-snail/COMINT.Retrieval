values of the transport coefficients in a plasma for any
    degree of ionization based on a maxwellian distribution values
    for electrical conductivity for any degree of ionization steady
    magnetic field and various electron neutral collision laws are
    presented other transport coefficients are tabulated the
    analysis uses the fokker planck and boltzmann equations
