effective depth of secondary electron emission an
    experimental investigation is reported the principal
    conclusions are tht the effective depth of secondary electron
    emission is smaller in metals than in semiconductors that it is
    independent of the primary electron energy and that there is no
    direct relation between the secondary emission efficiency and
    the emission depth
