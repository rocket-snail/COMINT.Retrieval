some passive networks under transient conditions two
    groups of passive quadripoles are defined by their transfer
    functions those approximating to an ideal delay line those
    producing a gaussian waveform from an input pulse of
    sufficiently short duration a method of synthesizing such
    networks given the attenuation and phase shift coefficients is
    based on a continued fraction expansion of the quotient of a
    hypergeometric function
