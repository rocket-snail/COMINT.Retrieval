negative capacitance amplifier noise the inheret
    limitations of negative capacitance feedback due to the finite
    time constant and internal noise of an actual amplifier are
    discussed it is shown that the limitation caused by noise
    applies to any circuit that is designed to reduce the input
    time constant
