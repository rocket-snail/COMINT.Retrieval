transistor amplifier cut off frequency the effect of the
    positive feedback associated with the internal base resistance
    of a transistor on its cut off frequency is analysed expansion
    of the expression for current gain in a taylor series shows
    that only the phase shift in is important in reducing the cut
    off frequency
