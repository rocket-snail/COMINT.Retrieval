the spatial distribution and the nature of radio stars
    data obtained from a survey of radio stars by shakeshaft et al
    to be published in are analysed the results indicate an
    apparent increase in the spatial distribution density with
    distance in all directions a reasonable interpretation of the
    results cannot be provided unless most of the stars are assumed
    to be outside the galaxy
