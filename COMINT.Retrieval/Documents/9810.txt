study of layer splitting in the ionosphere an equation is
    derived expressing the conditions for one or more maxima to
    occur in the height distributions of temperature and
    recombination coefficient a numerical treatment is given for
    splitting with uniform temperature distribution would imply a
    highly improbable value for the recombination coefficient on
    the other hand the presence of a warm layer within the layer
    would lead to results consistent with the observations
