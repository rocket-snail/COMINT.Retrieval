the teacher and the media centre-problems and
    disturbances in use. the functions and organisation of school
    libraries/media centres as indispensible prerequisites for the
    realisation of educational aims have been discussed since the
    1970s, but librarians' high expectations have generally not
    been realised. even in comprehensive schools, media centres are
    still only on the fringe of school life. the use of a media
    centre as a focal point of school activities demands radical
    changes in school structure and the teacher's role. many of the
    media provided are unsuited to the school learning situation.
    teachers have to spend much time planning the development of
    independent study programmes; close cooperation with school
    librarians would prove helpful here. administration of
    centrally stored media is effective and economical but since
    much time is wasted when children move between classroom and
    media centre, flexible timetables should be developed.
