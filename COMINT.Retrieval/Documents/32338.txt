effective current and efficiency of small mains supply
    units with capacitively terminated rectifiers when a mains
    transformer is wholly or partially loaded by a capacitively
    terminated rectifier network the effective value of the
    rectifier current pulses is determinative for the copper losses
    and the waveform distortion for the magnetic losses effective
    current and efficiency curves are presented for various simple
    types of rectifier circuits
