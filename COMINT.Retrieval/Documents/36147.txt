on the stability of distributions of the type described
    by trueswell. application of rules for weeding that are based
    upon the unequal distribution of demand over the collection
    require that the distribution remain stable over time. a
    mathematical expression is derived that tests that stability.
    verification of the expression is not inordinately time
    consuming and is very easy in the case of automated circulation
    systems. the technique was first introduced by richard w.
