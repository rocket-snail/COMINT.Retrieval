state-of-the-art report on structure-activity methods
    development. the overall objective of this project is to
    provide the agency with the technical basis for estimating the
    toxicity and environmental behaviour of organic chemicals from
    molecular structure. the project is directed toward the
    evaluation of quantitative structure-activity relationships
    (qsar) for use by epa program offices and toward the
    development of new data and qsar methods to extend the
    technique to meet agency needs. specifically, the objective of
    the structure-activity project is to develop methods to predict
    the toxicity, persistence, and treatability of large numbers of
    untested chemicals using qsar based on structural, chemical,
    and biological properties of representative reference data
    bases.
