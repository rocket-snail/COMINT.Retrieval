energy conservation in the construction of new library
    buildings. at a time of rapidly rising energy costs
    energy-consciousness has become a necessity in the construction
    of new library buildings. at mierlo in the netherlands a new
    public library was opened in nov 81. by the insertion of extra
    insulation in the floor, walls and roof, and the most efficient
    use of heat generated by the artificial lighting it is expected
    that heating costs for the library will be 1/3 of the normal
    amount for buildings of similar dimensions. in addition, the
    use of prefabricated parts in the construction of the library
    enabled the building to be completed in 22 weeks with a
    consequent saving in labour costs.
