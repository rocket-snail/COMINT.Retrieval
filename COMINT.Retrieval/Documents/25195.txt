analog computing by heat transfer multiplier divider ac
    integrating and differentiating circuits are described based on
    the use of a thermal transducer this transducer consists
    basically of a pair of heater elements each one of which is in
    thermal contact with one of a pair of temperature sensing
    elements mounted in a wheatstone bridge circuit appropriate
    application to the heater elements of two electrical input
    signals creates a temperature difference proportional to their
    product between the sensing elements
