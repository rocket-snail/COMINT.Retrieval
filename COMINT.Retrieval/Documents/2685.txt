the efficiency of a ferrite as a microwave mixer it is
    shown theoretically that a polycrystalline ferrite should
    behave like a single crystal sample magnetization measurements
    taken previously are explained by assuming a basic permeability
    line width of a few gauss and a spread in resonant fields from
    point to point the efficiency appears to be lower than for a
    conventional crystal mixer
