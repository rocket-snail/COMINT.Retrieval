the use of an electron velocity analyser to stabilize a
    direct voltage source to a few parts in a million a
    degenerative feedback stabilizer circuit is used in which the
    signal to the feedback amplifier is obtained by accelerating a
    beam of electrons by the voltage to be stabilized and measuring
    the velocity by deflection in a fixed magnetic field much
    larger signals can be obtained in this way than by use of the
    usual resistance type potential divider
