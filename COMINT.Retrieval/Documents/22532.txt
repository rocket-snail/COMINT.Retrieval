a visit to brent public library. a german librarian
    records her impressions of this london borough's library work
    with foreign minority groups, including west indians, africans,
    indians and people of mixed race. since 5 different indian
    languages are spoken in brent, all library notices are
    published in them as well as in english. the traditional form
    of municipal library, comprising a central library with
    branches closely dependent upon it, seemed no longer suitable
    for this community. a large degree of autonomy was therefore
    given to each branch library, helping it to cater better for
    the special needs of its district. books are lent to youth and
    sports clubs and activities organised for different ethnic
    groups. intensive training is provided for library staff on the
    history, culture and contemporary problems of the african,
    asian and caribbean races.
