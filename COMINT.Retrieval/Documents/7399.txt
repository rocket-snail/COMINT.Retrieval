some new aspects of the reflection of electromagnetic
    waves on a rough surface the roughness is represented by
    electromagnetically interacting hemispherical bosses whose
    radii and mutual distances are small relative to the wavelength
    the effects of such a surface on both vertically and
    horizontally polarized radiations are considered as functions
    of the angle of incidence
