accurate height measurements using an ionospheric
    recorder a method for the calibration of an ionospheric
    recorder is described which corrects errors in height
    measurement arising from the distortion of the echo pulse in
    its passage through the receiver the amount of this error
    depends on the echo amplitude and is shown to vary in an
    approximately linear manner with the width of the recorded echo
    trace several methods of checking the calibration confirm that
    it is reliable to within using a calibrated recorder and an
    expanded timebase it is possible to measure region equivalent
    heights to this order of accuracy the systematic error due to
    pulse distortion will in general cause the heights recorded in
    routine ionospheric measurements to be from to too high some
    consequences of this for predictions are mentioned
