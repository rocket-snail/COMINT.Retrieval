calculation of magnetic field strength in cylindrical
    coils expressions are derived for the axial component of the
    magnetic field using the fact that the field strength at a
    given point is proportional to the difference of the solid
    angles subtended by the end faces of the coil the expression
    for the solid angles is obtained in the form of a difference of
    two double series this can easily be evaluated approximately
    tables and graphs are given together with numerical examples
    illustrating the method the case of a multilayer coil is
    included
