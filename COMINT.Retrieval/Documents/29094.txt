the quality of oscillators with differently located
    losses network oscillator with parallel and series losses is
    investigated to determine whether the factor can be improved by
    a reduction of load impedance in conjunction with an
    appropriate increase in oscillator gain the reduction of load
    impedance is effected by considering the loss impedance to be
    added in parallel with thk load
