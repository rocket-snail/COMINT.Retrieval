a study of winds in the ionosphere by radio methods
    report of an investigation made using mitras method of the
    measurements were made in ottawa and later in montreal and
    covered a period of a year at a nominal height of km e layer
    the speed of the wind showed a mean daily variation of
    approximately half day period and about amplitude this
    variation can be explained on the basis of tidal oscillations
    in the atmosphere a variation corresponding to lunar
    atmospheric tides has also been detected at this level the
    winds in the f region appear to increase in speed with increase
    of magnetic activity this effect is not observed in the e
    region except during severe ionospheric disturbances
