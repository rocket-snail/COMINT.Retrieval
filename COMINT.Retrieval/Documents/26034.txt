attainable benefits of the medical management information
    system are not being realized. states that users of medicaid
    management information systems should be able to administer
    their medicaid programme more efficiently, effectively, and
    economically. the department of health, education, and welfare
    (hew) pays states 90% of the cost to develop such systems and
    75% of the cost to operate them, instead of the usual 50% cost
    sharing. hew has determined that 17 states have systems which
    meet legislative and regulatory requirements; gao reviewed 3 of
    them. neither the states nor the federal government are
    realising all benefits expected.
