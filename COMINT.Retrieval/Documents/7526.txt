a theoretical consideration of the electron and ion
    density distributions in the lower portion of the f region
    assuming that the photoionization processes in the ionosphere
    are the physics of the lower f region can be explained fairly
    well the appearance and disappearance of the f layer with solar
    zenith angle and solar activity can be understood no values of
    reaction coefficients can be found which are consistent with
    both the ion density distribution in the ionosphere and
    laboratory estimates of the coefficients
