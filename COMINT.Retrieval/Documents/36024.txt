library services to the disadvantaged: not quite what
    they seem. paper presented at the uk public libraries group
    weekend school, bath 1980. discusses the standard of the
    provision made by uk public libraries for the disadvantaged,
    and argues that, whilst libraries have largely responded to the
    needs of the institutionally disadvantaged (eg hospital
    patients, the handicapped, and prison inmates), the socially
    and culturally disadvantaged have been largely ignored.
    identifies a basic dichotomy which has 2 aspects: the disparity
    between levels of provision for various disadvantaged groups;
    and the disparity between service to the disadvantaged and
    service to the community at large. reports criticisms which
    have been made of the inadequacy of the work done by libraries
    with ethnic minorities, in deprived areas, and with relation to
    functional literacy and the encouragement of reading. stresses
    the need for the provision of courses on, and the initiation of
    research into, library services for the disadvantaged.
