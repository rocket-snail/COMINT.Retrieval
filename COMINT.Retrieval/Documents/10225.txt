collection development in ten small academic libraries' a
    report to the council on library resources. this investigation
    of how 10 small, private college libraries go about collecting
    books focuses on the degree of responsibility and control those
    libraries exercise over what is included in their collections.
    the findings and conclusions of the study are based upon
    interviews with library administrators and acquisitions
    librarians at middlebury college, bowdoin, colby, bates,
    wellesley, amherst, trinity, hamilton, union, and colgate.
    these colleges were chosen because of thier similarities of
    purpose, staff size, student enrollment, faculty, number of
    library volumes added annually, library budgets, and library
    holdings. chapters identify the objectives of the study, the
    methodology used, findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
