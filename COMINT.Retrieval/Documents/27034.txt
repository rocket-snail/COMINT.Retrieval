a theoretical analysis of the torsional electromechanical
    filters the mechanical properties of a torsional system are
    expressed in terms of electrical equivalents by introducing a
    transducer transfer ratio with the dimensions of charge a
    method is developed for the design of electromechanical filters
    based on equivalent electrical networks pass band ripple
    spurious modes and transducer matching are discussed
