state support for ecclesiastical public libraries in
    bavaria. during the last 30 years it has been affirmed that
    financial support of public libraries run by the churches is
    needed at state and national level because they are public
    libraries. church public library achievements at this time
    include stock increases, the development of staff training and
    social service within librarianship. it is disputed as to
    whether they are religious rather than public libraries and
    whether centralised services for them are too costly. the
    smaller branches could be regarded as a hindrance to the mobile
    libraries and the use of voluntary staff could be an excuse not
    to employ full-time administrators. a plurality of library
    authorities can be regarded as economic. financial assistance
    for all public libraries is provided by the state, especially
    in places where the church library may be the only public
    library.
