the philsom automated serials control system' an
    introduction. describes the philsom automated serials control
    system developed at the washington university school of
    medicine library at st. louis, which provides automated support
    for the full range of serials control activity within the
    libraries participating in the philsom network. the philsom
    system attempts to predict the issues which will be received by
    the various participating libraries and to provide them with
    records describing each of these issues. the records for
    checked-in issues automatically update the holdings data, and
    interact with previously coded data to produce claims and
    binding notifications. the system also produces additional
    outputs to aid in serials control.
