the occurrence of the spread f and the geomagnetic field
    spread f is more probable in days after a sudden commencement
    at high latitudes and less probable at low latitudes especially
    at the equinoctial seasons there is a strong correlation
    between the magnitude of the geomagnetic field and the
    occurrence of spread f at low latitudes a turbulence mechanism
    is suggested to explain this
