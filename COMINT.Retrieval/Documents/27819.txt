state of the art in library training and extension
    training of librarians. an abridged version of the proposals
    prepared by a working committee of the hungarian council of
    libraries relating to the content, organisational and
    quantitative development of library training, which in the past
    has not kept pace with the increase in staff numbers working in
    the field nor with the development and growth of knowledge
    necessary for both the librarian and the information
    specialist.
