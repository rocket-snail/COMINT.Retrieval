isorid-a critique. discusses the development of, and
    comments critically on the performance of unesco's
    international information system on research in documentation
    (isorid). the isorid programme was launched in the early 1970s
    as an internationally-dimensioned mechanism for the recording
    of planned, ongoing, and completed library and information
    science research, and during a period operated as a joint
    venture between fid and unesco. concludes that a number of
    problems and syndromes characterise isorid' much relevant
    information is not finding its way into the system; there are
    considerable time-lags between the recording of r&d
    projects and their listing in the printed services;
    sophistication and optimisation of systems functions along with
    a higher degree of 'user friendliness' is required; and a real
    user study would be desirable.
