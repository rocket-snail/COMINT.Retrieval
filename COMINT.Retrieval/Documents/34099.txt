here the librarian donates her salary to the library. a
    talk given to the 14th nordic library meeting on the theme'
    part-time libraries today and tomorrow. with a definition of
    part-time libraries as those open only a few hours a week,
    iceland has only 15 full-time libraries out of 250; 25 of 40
    central libraries are part-time. with 60% of the population
    living in the reykjavik region and the rest scattered in small
    local authorities, it is not economically possible to have a
    library service which fulfils ifla norms. the library act of
    1976 made local authorities financially responsible for
    libraries. many, therefore, combined school and public
    libraries, as education receives state support. most libraries
    charge fees for borrowing and most librarians are unqualified.
    the solution lies in reducing the number of central libraries
    to 8; these should be run by the state and have mobile
    libraries. local libraries should also be fewer. training for
    part-time librarians with proper salary condi tions should be
    initiated.
