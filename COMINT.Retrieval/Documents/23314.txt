multi-purpose plans, something for hard times' library,
    kindergarten, bridge-club etc. 62% of norwegian branch
    libraries serve populations under 1000, 97% are smaller than
    the recommended minimum of 100 sq.m., and 80% open 6 hours or
    less per week. there is need for a massive library building
    programme, or, more realistically, cooperation with similarly
    placed organisations. already 18% of public libraries share
    premises with school libraries, and 20% with offices etc.
    multi-purpose planning must recognise the needs of all
    potential users and involve them in discussions. the library is
    traditionally used for activities such as meetings and
    concerts. other possibilities include cooperation with nursery
    schools, which have short opening hours in sparsely populated
    communities, or welfare services, which need central
    premises.
