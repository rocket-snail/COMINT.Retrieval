radar echoes from inter stroke processes in lightning
    radar echoes at were used to investigate interstroke lightning
    processes the most intense activity of junction streamers is
    between heights of these junction streamers may sometimes grow
    in height up to although their activity decreases with height
    the lowest level at which they occur remains constant
    throughout flashes and their horizontal extent is about to km
    echoes from these junctions always decrease before the onset of
    a flash
