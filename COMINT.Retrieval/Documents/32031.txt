education of information users in agriculture. it is now
    commonplace that the growth of published literature is such
    that no individual can read all relevant material. instructing
    and training undergraduates in making use of libraries and
    centres of scientific, technical and economic information,
    firstly at the relevant establishment of higher education and
    later on in their working place, is therefore of the highest
    significance. for greater effect, training should begin during
    compulsory school attendance. since 1977, the school of animal
    breeding and veterinary medicine at stara zagora has been one
    of the pioneers in this field. it is hoped that national
    syllabuses will be introduced in the foreseeable future.
