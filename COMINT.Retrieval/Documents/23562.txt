direct measurement of the ellipticity of the rf cotton
    effect by the quarter wave method measurements were made using
    a circular waveguide of diameter with an aerial at one end
    connected to a klystron and a rotatable probe at the other end
    two copper pins of lengths mm and mm respectively are fixed mm
    apart in an axial insulator rod making angles of and
    respectively with the direction of the electric field the
    variation with wavelength of the plane of polarization and of
    the degree of extinction obtainable are shown graphically it is
    shown that the wave is elliptically polarized by inserting a
    quarter wave unit to produce a linear polarization
