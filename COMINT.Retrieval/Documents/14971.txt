the measurement of a matrix elements of passive networks
    th general method of using the a matrix has previously been
    described of a method is here described for determining the
    matrix elements from measurements of the impedance looking in
    at the sending nd of a network the receiving end being first
    open circuited and then short circuited the elements so found
    apply only for the measurement frequency the analysis shows
    that networks are electrically equivalent at a given frequency
    when their a matrices are equal at that frequency
