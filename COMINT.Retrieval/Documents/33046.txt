deciding the future of the catalog in small libraries. in
    jan 81, the library of congress closed its card catalogue and
    adopted aacr 2 (the anglo-american cataloguing rules, 2nd
    edition). now, every us library must decide upon the future of
    its catalogue in the face of these decisions. each must decide
    whether or not to use aacr 2, and if so, when to implement it.
    presents a checklist which will aid the library in its
    planning, with a brief bibliography of items relating to the
    future of the catalogue vis-a-vis the new code.
