thickness shear vibrations of piezoelectric crystal
    plates with incomplete electrodes the method developed in above
    is applied to determine the influence of electrode length on
    thickness shear frequencies for a partially coated crystal
    these frequencies depend on the coupling between the coated and
    uncoated portions considered as separate systems
