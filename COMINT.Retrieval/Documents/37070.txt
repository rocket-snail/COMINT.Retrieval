advantages of on-line literature research and the
    existing available data bases. obvious advantages of on-line
    literature research compared to traditional methods such as
    library subject catalogues are' the research results are
    complete; the information retrieval is precise due to the
    possibility of and/or combinations; time is saved and the
    research results are automatically printed in a hardcopy form
    instead of having to be photocopied or handwritten. in west
    germany, 75% of computer stored literature references i.e. 70
    million document units are available through national and
    international data bases. 3 of the most important data bases in
    west germany are dimdi (deutsches institut fur medizinische
    dokumentation und information, inka (informationssystem
    karlsruhe) and gid (gesellschaft fur information und
    dokumentation). the largest international data bases are
    lockheed, the european space agency (esa) and the british
    library automated information service (blaise).
