spin echo memory device a proton rich sample placed in a
    strong inhomogeneous magnetic field of mean strength h was
    subjected to a pattern of relatively weak radio frequency
    pulses at the larmor frequency of the protons in the field h
    the pattern was then recalled by applying a strong rf pulse at
    a later time as in the spin echo technique it is shown both
    mathematically and experimentally that such a series of pulses
    varying in amplitude can be memorized by the spin system of
    protons for times as long as one second and then repeated
    preserving both shape and relative amplitude spin echoes are
    discussed by hahn in
