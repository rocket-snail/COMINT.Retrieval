collecting canadiana at the library of congress. presents
    the results of an investigation into how many canadian books
    reach the us library of congress and their route. the canadian
    collection is not catalogued separately and the last study of
    canadian holdings was carried out in 1971. lc holdings reflect
    reader interest (and requests from other libraries), so it may
    be presumed that the recent increase in canadian studies
    courses at us universities will affect lc acquisition policies
    (at present a matter of random selection and intermittent
    funding).
