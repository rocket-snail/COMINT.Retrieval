the reflection coefficient of the long wave the
    propagation equation is solved and the reflection coefficient
    deduced for long waves incident vertically on a region of low
    electron concentration such as that situ ted below the e layer
    results are given for two cases based on different assumptions
    regarding the vertical gradient of concentration comparison of
    these calculated results with observations on and waves
    indicates that there is a considerable gradient of electron
    concentration in the layer
