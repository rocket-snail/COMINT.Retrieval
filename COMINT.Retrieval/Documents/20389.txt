zzzz. the swedish government has, through the delegation
    for scientific and technical information, appointed a committee
    to plan a system of central libraries. firstly, an inventory
    and analysis of the swedish information system will be carried
    out; then a model for a central library system will probably be
    tested; and finally the committee will produce a proposal for
    such a system, with each central library responsible for a
    certain area of the total national holdings of scientific and
    technical literature.
