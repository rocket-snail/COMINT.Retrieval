the needs of the handicapped readers must be given high
    priority. describes the work of arhus public libraries' av
    department, opened in dec 80. the equipment includes record
    players, tape recorders, screens for slides and transcript
    readers for enlargement of text. the stock includes books with
    tapes, talking books for adults and children, art slides,
    non-musical records and cassettes, easy readers, pictorial
    works and magnaprint books. the users are the blind and
    partially sighted, mostly the elderly, and those with reading
    difficulties, mostly children and young people. not all
    materials, e.g. the language courses and art slides, are aimed
    at the handicapped. library service to the handicapped places
    greater demands on the staff than other lending services. few
    users are able to help themselves to material and need
    assistance from the staff; most material needs to be examined
    and played before borrowing and checking on return. the
    department buys published editions of books cum tapes, and also
    records suitable books itself, but demand for material is far
    from being satisfied.
