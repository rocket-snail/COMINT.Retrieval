the federal side of traditional telecommunications cost
    allocations. whatever the outcome of legislative proposals
    before the 96th congress, the structure of the
    telecommunications industry is being debated in numerous
    regulatory proceedings, court cases, etc. central to these
    discussions are 'proper costs' and their relationships not only
    to prices but also to other benefits or burdens. costs have
    been allocated in the traditional telecommunications industry
    mainly by a 2-stage process. 1st, explicit jurisdictional
    separations have allocated costs hence revenue requirements
    among the federal and all the state jurisdictions. 2nd, pricing
    rather than costing policy has determined the further incidence
    of benefits and burdens in the general absence of explicit
    suballocations of costs within the pools of costs assigned to
    the broad aggregates of interstate and state services.
