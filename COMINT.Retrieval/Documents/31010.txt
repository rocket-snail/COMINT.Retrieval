an electrodynamic perturbation theorem with application
    to nonreciprocal systems a modification of the reciprocity
    theorem is used to evaluate the antisymmetric part of the
    admittance matrix of an electrodynamic system in terms of the
    fields produced by the applied voltages the effect of system
    perturbations on the admittance matrix is determined the method
    is applicable to and microwave gyrators as well as to
    reciprocal systems but gives solutions only to a first order of
    approximation
