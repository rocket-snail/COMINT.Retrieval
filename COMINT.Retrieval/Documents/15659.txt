forces and stresses in an electromagnetic field the
    theories of faraday larmor and livens and the energy method are
    compared and applied to some illustrative examples the three
    theories may lead to different results for nonrigid magnetic
    materials and the larmor and livens theory may not be
    applicable to magnetostriction a discussion by r m lichtenstein
    giving a further thermodynamic method is included
