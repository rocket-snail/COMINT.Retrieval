the double resonance in the secondary of a system of two
    circuits with inductive coupling the resonance condition is
    defined in terms of the primary and secondary impedances and
    the mutual inductance the variation of secondary current with
    the coupling frequency and series capacitance is determined in
    the case of a variable frequency with fixed coupling a
    graphical method is used to derive equal current curves by
    means of these a region can be defined within which two
    resonance peaks occur
