parallel network oscillators general principles are
    discussed of electronically tunable wide band oscillators
    having two signal paths with their outputs added and a common
    feedback path the tuning is performed by differentially
    controlling the gain in the two paths eg by push pull
    modulation particular arrangements described include a twin
    triode circuit using an artificial transmission line network
    giving a tuning ratio and a four valve circuit with lead and
    lag networks giving a frequency range nearly independent of
    centre frequency amplitude constancy stability waveform and
    noise are examined
