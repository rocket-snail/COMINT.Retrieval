experimental determination of the energy distribution of
    thermoelectron beams an investigation using the lenard
    retarding field method is reported this method gave results
    accurate to within for electron energies in the range results
    indicate that a maxwell distribution occurs only at low beam
    currents and densities no direct dependence was found on
    cathode temperature space charge at the cathode or control
    potential a depence was observed on current density and to a
    lesser degree on current intensity deviations from maxwells
    distribution could not be attributed to errors in calculation
    collisions with the residual gas spectrometer effect of the
    emitter transverse resistances of cathode or local anomalies of
    the work function positive results were obtained by relating
    the electron energy distribution to longitudinal space charge
    oscillations produced by the shot effect shifts of the energy
    distribution are due to changes in the work function and the
    development of a potential barrier near the cathode
