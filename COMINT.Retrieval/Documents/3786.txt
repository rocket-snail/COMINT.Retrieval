essential similarity and relations between amplitude and
    phase distortions in video amplifiers in the complex method of
    e representation the transmission function of a video amplifier
    for steady oscillations can be regarded as the sum of an ideal
    transmission function and an error function the error function
    is applied in investigating the relations between an arbitrary
    transmission function with superposed amplitude and phase
    errors and the associated distortions for the minimum phase
    shift condition the investigation gives an insight into the
    physical relation between the distortions the formulae derived
    are applied to determine the distortions for a sytem with a
    tchebycheff type transmission function these distortions are
    then compared with those for a system with a steady fall of
    amplitude near the cut off frequency
