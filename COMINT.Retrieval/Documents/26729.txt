isolation of the eleven yearly variation of the
    horizontal component of the earths magnetic field by linear
    combinations of ordinates the ev eleven yearly component is
    brought into evidence by using labroustes method of analysis
    this component has in general a minimum value years after the
    maximum of sunspot activity and a total amplitude of gamma
    exceptional results observed for certain stations are
    discussed
