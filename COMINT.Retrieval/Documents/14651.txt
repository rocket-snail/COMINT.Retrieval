copper eddy current losses in coils with car onyl iron
    and ferrite cores the design of low loss short multilayer coils
    and long single layer coils is considered because core losses
    are much reduced with modern ferrite cores the relative
    importance of the copper eddy current losses s greater these
    losses and their dependence on the coil and core parameters are
    discussed in detail
