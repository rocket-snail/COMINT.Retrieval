office systems and people. offices are organisational
    units in which information is processed by people. it is
    essential that we understand the attitudes and requirements of
    these people before we attempt to design systems for them. we
    need models of offices and of office work, for use as a basis
    for system design and system evaluation. models can be
    developed through studies of offices and in particular through
    observations of how electronic office systems impact office
    work. summarises recent research work in these areas, and shows
    how it can assist us in designing systems that meet the needs
    of office workers.
