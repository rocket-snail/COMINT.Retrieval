reference book or textbook?. in an attempt to obtain the
    views of lecturers and students on the 2nd edition of
    2bibliotheek en dokumentatie' handboek ten dienste van de
    opleidingen1 (2libraries and documentation' a handbook for
    students1) published in 1979, the editorial board of 2open1
    circulated a questionnaire to all library schools in the
    netherlands. the results showed that most lecturers and
    students made use of the book, although a few had not used it
    at all, because, they felt, certain topics were insufficiently
    covered, including audio-visual materials, children's
    literature and library automation. the results also showed that
    the book was used more as a textbook to provide information
    additional to that obtained in lectures, rather than as a
    reference book. however, on the whole most respondents felt the
    book to be a useful introduction to librarianship.
