personal reference collections and online searching. a
    massive number of personal collections of papers and reports
    exist in medicine and a wide number of other subject areas. the
    usefulness of these collections could be improved by providing
    a link with the large on-line collections, informing the user
    which retrieved references were held in his own collection.
    this link could be achieved with extra local processing on the
    search terminal resulting in improved confidence in on-line
    systems and increased utilisation of both remote and personal
    collections.
