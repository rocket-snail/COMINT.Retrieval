some regularities of the ionospheric f region the f layer
    regularities observed by ratcliffe are confined to a few
    stations only and disappear when the bifurcation of the f layer
    is large if the ion content of the f a and f layers is
    considered as a whole the regularities become much more marked
    n and are observed at slough falkland islands and singapore
    even when the bifurcation is large peaks observed in the
    monthly mean values are attributed to tidal effects the results
    are in conformity with the view that the f and f layers
    constitute a single ionization region
