radiation of plasma noise from arc discharge radiation
    from cold cathode dc are discharges in air has been observed at
    frequencies of and the oscillation is thought to be generated
    by periodic electron emission from the cathode caused by a
    small perturbation of the potential gradient due to variation
    of the ion sheath potential
