thin film cryotrons discussion of the characteristics of
    evaporated superconductive films as applied to cryotrons and
    details of a thin film cryotron made by vacuum deposition which
    is much smaller than the wire wound component the performance
    of this cryotron is given and it is applied to flip flop
    circuits finally its use in ring oscillators is analysed by two
    different methods
