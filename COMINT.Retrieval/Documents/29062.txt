harmonic generation with nonlinear reactances a simple
    theory of frequency multiplication using nonlinear reactances
    is derived and compared withe the results obtained with the
    nonlinear capacitance of a ge point contact diode the theory
    and the experimental results are in agreement at low input
    powers possible reasons for the discrepancies at high powers
    are mentioned
