algorithmic generation of chemical abstracts index names.
    1. general design. the chemical abstracts service (cas)
    chemical registry system is a computer-based chemical
    information system that uniquely identifies chemical substances
    on the basis of their molecular structure. an algorithm has
    been developed for computer generation of chemical abstracts
    (ca) index names for organic compounds from registry structure
    records. when programmed and installed in the cas production
    system, the algorithm will support ca index preparation by
    generating names for a majority of the approximately 1400 new
    structures processed per working day at cas.
