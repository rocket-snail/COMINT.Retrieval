the college textbook as a tool for collection evaluation,
    analysis, and retrospective collection development. the search
    for effective methods of predicting book and journal use has
    been a central concern for acquisitions librarians. suggests
    the application of citation analysis to the college textbook as
    a means of evaluating, analysing, and developing book
    collections in small and medium sized academic libraries.
    presents arguments for the relevance of textbook citations. a
    study of the references found in 25 texts in 5 separate
    disciplines indicates that the titles cited go far beyond basic
    checklists in number and depth and that many of these titles
    will not be included in smaller academic library collections
    developed according to traditional methods.
