a theory of ionospheric currents associated with aurorae
    the current distributions induced by dynamo action in a sheet
    of partially ionized gas moving with uniform velocity across a
    perpendicular magnetic field are derived for the case where the
    gas contains an elliptical region of greater ionization density
    on the basis of the theory the average ionospheric current
    flowing along a long homogeneous arc is calculated and some
    results predicted by the theory are compared with observational
    evidence
