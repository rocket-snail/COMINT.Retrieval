music in the library. everyone who wishes should be able
    to obtain musical recordings of interest to them and related
    reference material. but some readers need qualified specialist
    help. most people visit the music library hoping to find some
    sort of club. librarians must estimate which resources would
    achieve the music library's aims. a large record library and
    good technical equipment are essential. series of slides
    accompanying the music create a better artistic and historic
    atmosphere. the librarian should observe all new events in the
    musical world, maintaining close contact with his audience's
    interests and developing individual and group activities to
    make the music section a centre of attraction.
