ultraviolet absorption of atomic nitrogen in its
    ionization continuum the absorption of radiation of by the
    plasma of a discharge in an ionization gauge was measured by
    passing the transmitted radiation into a spectrograph various
    considerations indicate that the absorption is due to atomic
    nitrogen the absorption cross section of which is hence
    deduced
