theory of correlation tables. 1. a possible mathematical
    model is presented for correlation tables used in spectroscopy.
    a process based on information theory is demonstrated through
    an example for the optimum construction of correlation tables.
    in this example the construction of an nmr correlation table is
    investigated; the method is general and is suitable for the
    construction of correlation tables used in computerised
    evaluation of spectra.
