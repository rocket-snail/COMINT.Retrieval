a note on the sluggishness of the ionosphere by analogy
    with the lr circuit a time of relaxation analogous to a time
    constant is obtained from the equation for the variation of
    ionization where n is the electron density and the
    recombination coefficient two methods of determining n are
    described and its value is calculated for the d e f and f
    winter layers although the value of n varies by a factor of
    over n is constant within a factor of about this result may be
    interpreted as indicating either that must fall steadily from
    the d to the f layer or that the physical process of electron
    disappearance is not merely one of attachment
