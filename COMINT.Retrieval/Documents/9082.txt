the situation in canada and the united states.
    contribution to a thematic issue on public lending right (plr).
    discussion on plr is much further advanced in canada than in
    the usa-authors' and librarians' groups have issued resolutions
    and manifestoes; formal debates have been held; and the canada
    council (a governmental corporation which administers grant
    programmes for artists and authors) is developing a model for
    compensating authors, based on holdings of their works by
    libraries. given the present political climate in the usa, plr
    issues are not as tightly drawn there. most us librarians are
    only dimly aware of plr, but militancy among professional
    authors is growing.
