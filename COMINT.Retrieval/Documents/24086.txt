electromagnetic scattering by thin conducting plates at
    glancing incidence a large signal is scattered back from a thin
    plate illuminated edge on by a field whose magnetic vector is
    normal to the plate experimental measurements show that the
    currents in the plate are predominant near the edges their
    relation to theoretical results is discussed
