design of symmetrical bridge type electrical filters by
    the operating parameter theory design formulae are developed
    and tabulated for symmetrical low pass filters of degrees and
    for attenuation characteristics with given zeros and poles a
    review of the theoretical foundations is based on work by cauer
    of and by darlington of
