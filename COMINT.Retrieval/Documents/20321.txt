the library within the cooperation between twin towns.
    the importance of twinning arrangements between nordic towns
    for the furtherance of nordic culture is recognised, but the
    role of libraries in this cooperation is not clear. the library
    is the natural point for collection of material about the twin
    towns and for the transfer of material from the home town to
    the twin towns. it should encourage reading of the neighbouring
    countries' literature. describes the exchange agreements
    between jamtland regional library in sweden, and south
    trondelag library association and the regional library in
    trondheim, norway. joint seminars on nordic literature are held
    every other year. it is hoped eventually to extend cooperation
    to the finnish and danish twin towns.
