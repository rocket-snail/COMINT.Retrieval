    a philosophical discussion of the impact of the information
    technology revolution on work and society. suggests that
    communicative society tends to democratise because of the
    enormous expansion in the physical infrastructure of
    communication systems and a shift in the labour force so that
    information operatives become dominant. stresses that the most
    important input into modern productive systems is knowledge.
    predicts that by the 1990s the world will move into an era of
    peace and prosperity.
