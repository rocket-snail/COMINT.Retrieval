anomalous ionization in the upper atmosphere over the
    auroral zone during magnetic storms the depth of penetration of
    and the rate of ionization by protons of extraterrestrial
    origin are estimated an explanation is given of the rapid
    variations of the geomagnetic field in and near the auroral
    zone
