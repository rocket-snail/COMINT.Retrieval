parametric amplification along nonlinear transmission
    lines a pump signal propagating along a dispersionless
    transmission line with a distributed nonlinear capacitance is
    subject to deformation since different parts of the signal move
    with different velocities the deformation will affect the
    parametric amplification process so that in general a
    sinusoidal will not be increased inits fundamental frequency bi
    travelling down the line
