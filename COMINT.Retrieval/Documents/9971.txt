politics of local interlibrary cooperation. social and
    political issues are key factors in developing cooperation
    among us public libraries. experiences in public library
    cooperation have shown that the acceptance of cooperation as an
    ideal, patron reaction and acceptance, local pride and control,
    and the education and cooperation of the library board, local
    government officials, and funding agencies are all important in
    providing the best possible framework for cooperation. the
    commitment to and understanding of the implications, changes,
    and modifications that cooperation requires are also important.
    realisation that interpretation of what cooperation means and
    that unequal contributions can be expected are necessary steps
    in developing effective arrangements among public
    libraries.
