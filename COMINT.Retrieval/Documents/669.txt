the public library as provider of video. describes the
    availability of videotapes and equipment in danish public
    libraries. this amounted in 1977 to 5 libraries. most of the
    programmes are locally produced by amateur groups for
    educational and local historical purposes. only 1 library has
    taken up the offer of deposit of video cassettes from the state
    film centre. refers to various reports which make it clear that
    video is a material which properly belongs in a public library
    and can be acquired with public money. the desirability of
    having radio and tv programmes available for loan in public
    libraries has often been pointed out, but this would
    necessitate changes in the copyright act or direct negotiation
    by the libraries with the copyright holders. archives for radio
    and tv productions should be set up and the law on legal
    deposits expanded to include non-book material. cooperation
    within the nordic council is urged, and experiments in selected
    libraries are recommended.
