a translating computer interface for end-user operation
    of heterogeneous retrieval systems. 1. design. on-line
    retrieval systems may be difficult to use, especially by end
    users, because of heterogeneity and complexity. investigations
    have concerned the concept of a translating computer interface
    as a means to simplify access to, and operation of,
    heterogeneous bibliographic retrieval systems and data bases.
    the interface allows users to make requests in a common
    language. these requests are translated by the interface into
    the appropriate commands for whatever system is being
    interrogated. system responses may also be transformed by the
    interface into a common form before being given to the users.
    thus, the network of different systems is made to look like a
    single 'virtual' system to the user. the interface also
    provides instruction and other search aids for the user.
    philosophy, design and implementation of an experimental
    interface named conit are described.
