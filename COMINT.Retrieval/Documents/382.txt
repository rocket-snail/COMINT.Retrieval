the two helix method of polarization measurement of
    meteoric radio echoes an arrangement for investigating the
    polarization of radio echoes from meteors uses two helical
    receiving aerials wound in opposite senses in conjunction with
    a helical transmitting aerial the received signals are combined
    and displayed on a operating wavelength is and power output is
    the method is applicable to sporadic meteors results are in
    good agreement with theoretical values and with measurements
    made on shower meteors by
