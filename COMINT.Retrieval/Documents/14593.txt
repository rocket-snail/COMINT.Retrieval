the influence of the geomagnetic field on turbulence in
    the ionosphere damping of turbulent motion of neutral particles
    is negligible for the smaller eddies in the higher regions
    electrons are constrained to move nearly parallel to the
    magnetic field this results in variations of electron density
    even when the density of neutral molecules does not vary these
    variations may be appreciable above
