survey of airborne microwave refractometer measurements
    results of measurements made at various places in the over land
    and off the east and west coasts are summarized variations of
    the vertical distribution of refractive index are studied in
    relation to time and place particular attention is paid to the
    fine detail of the refractive index structure see also
