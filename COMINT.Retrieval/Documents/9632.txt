digital synthesis of correlated stationary noise in this
    note we propose a method of generating stationary noise with a
    prescribed auto-covariance function by digital methods. the
    need for such a technique often arises in testing the
    performance of data processing and engineering systems, where
    inputs corrupted with correlated noise (of a known form) are
    required. the technique is quite simple and produces
    strict-sense stationary noise which agrees approximately with
    r(t), the prescribed auto-covariance function (acf), over an
    interval [-t(0), t(0)]. the method consists of approximating
    the spectral density by a periodic process with spectral lines,
    and then synthesizing the periodic noise with random phases and
    appropriate amplitudes. in order to simplify discussion of the
    statistical properties of the noise generated, the technique is
    first presented in terms of exact harmonic analysis. in
    practice, discrete harmonic analysis as presented in the third
    section is used. july, 1962 peabody, p. r. adorno, d. s.
