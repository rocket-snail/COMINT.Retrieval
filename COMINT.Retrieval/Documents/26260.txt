theory of electroluminescence on the basis of the
    threshold value of the field necessary to excite luminescence
    the following three possible mechanisms are discussed direct
    ionization of impurity systems by the field acceleration of
    conduction electrons or valence band holes to velocities
    sufficient to produce excitation by inelastic collisions
    injection of charge carriers
