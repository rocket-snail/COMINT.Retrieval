molecular oscillators and amplifiers the principle and
    operation of molecular beam oscillators and amplifiers are
    described with reference to the ammonia beam maser molecular
    amplifiers based on paramagnetic crystals give a wider pass
    band and a higher output power than the molecular beam type the
    frequency stability achieved is within one part in
