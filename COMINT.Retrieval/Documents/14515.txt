measurement of positive ion density in the ionosphere by
    sounding rocket preliminary results are given of measurements
    made over the akita rocket range japan in september two rockets
    were launched one during the daytime and one at night each
    equipped with a spherical langmuir probe ascent and descent
    records for each flight show close agreement and values of l
    electron density scaled from records agree fairly well with
    those obtained from rocket measurements
