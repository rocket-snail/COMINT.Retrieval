the possibility of electron total energy distribution
    analysis in a quasi spherical capacitor the energy distribution
    of electrons emitted at various angles from a plane disk shaped
    target at the centre of a spherical collector is determined
    from an analysis of electron trajectories the discrepancy
    between these and those for a spherical capacitor does not
    exceed one per cent the provision of an aperture in the
    collector for an electron gun results in a five per cent
    error
