electrical integration methods following brief
    theoretical discussions of the rc miller and wiegand hansen of
    integrators a new quasi exact integrator circuit is described
    and both an approximate and an exact theory are given the
    errors inherent in the various methods are discussed and graphs
    for their estimation are given
