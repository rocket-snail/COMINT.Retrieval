effect of a radio pulse signal on resonant circuits
    calculations are made of the time required to establish the
    signal in a circuit of given bandwidth and time constant it is
    not possible to establish any simple relation between these
    parameters except in the case when the signal frequency is the
    same as the resonance frequency the influence f of signal
    duration is studied the results are of importance in connection
    with radiotelegraphy and explain the occurrence of maxima at
    the beginning n and end of each signal
