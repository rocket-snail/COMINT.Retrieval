review of electronic mail service systems planning for
    the u.s. postal service. postal service studies of an
    electronic mail service system and of electronic
    computer-originated mail are reviewed. as a result of the
    review it is concluded that the postal service should continue
    to develop electronic mail services insofar as they enhance
    present physical delivery of messages. electronic mail services
    should be managed by an independent unit within the postal
    service, and continued market research will be needed to
    determine customer needs. planning for the new services should
    be done in partnership with labour representatives, and the
    security of electronic mail against inspection and disclosure
    must be assured.
