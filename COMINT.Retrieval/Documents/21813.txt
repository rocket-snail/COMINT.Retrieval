prestel: what's in it for librarians?. prestel has a role
    to play in libraries as well as homes, in that prestel does
    what librarians have always done-storing, organising and
    retrieving information. whilst public interest in prestel has
    been limited, there is high interest in the library world.

    work, and much of value for the library user. describes a
    market trial of prestel in 1978 at the library of the
    university of aston, which proved the system to be generally
    satisfactory and cost-effective. it remains to be seen whether
    prestel will be found useful on a nationwide scale in uk
    libraries generally.
