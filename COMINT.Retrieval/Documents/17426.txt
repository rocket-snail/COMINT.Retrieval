rectification effect in gaseous discharges in crossed
    magnetic and electric fields description of an experimental
    crossed field diode consisting of two coaxial electrodes of
    stainless steel tube the inner electrode being filled with a
    ferrite stack separated by pieces of soft iron results obtained
    with a hydrogen filled tube under a pressure of show that the
    system is more efficient if the magnetic field is localized
    near the inner electrode in this manner
