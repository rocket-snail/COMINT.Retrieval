albania-a journey into the past and future. describes
    library conditions in albania. the country has a policy of
    self-sufficiency, which can make it seem isolated politically
    and economically. the public library structure consists of the
    national library and 26 central, district, libraries. the
    latter coordinate local library activities. the national
    library in tirana, with 800,000 volumes, has, like other public
    libraries, mainly technical, scientific, political and economic
    works, and receives 15 copies of each book published in
    albania. it runs a 2-year course in librarianship. describes
    visits to libraries in tirana and fier and to the university
    library in tirana, founded in 1957, with 550,000 volumes.
    cultural activities are given high priority, but take place
    outside libraries in cultural centres.
