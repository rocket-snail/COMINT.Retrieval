on empirical foundations of information science. in this
    study of empirical foundations of information science,
    pertinent empirical laws and hypotheses, which have been
    reported in scientific and technical literature, were
    catalogued, described, and analysed for their dependencies and
    relationships. the main objective of research was to identify a
    body of knowledge, derived from empirical observations of
    information phenomena and representative of information science
    as a distinct scientific discipline. this body of knowledge
    deals with concepts such as information value, relevance, aging
    of information, growth of knowledge, obsolescence, information
    scatter, productivity of information sources and information
    flow.
