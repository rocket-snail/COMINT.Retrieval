pulse scaler circuit with high resolving power a circuit
    with a resolving time of is based on a step by step capacitor
    charge and a rapid discharge process the scaling factor can be
    varied from without loss of stability as a frequency divider
    the circuit is limited to the range input pulses must be at
    least peak to peak
