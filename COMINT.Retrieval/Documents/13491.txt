quantum theory of fluctuation on the basis of an analysis
    of method of measurement an operator is constructed for the
    spectral density of a fluctuating variable the classical
    dynamic variables are replaced by time dependent operators the
    theory is used to deduce law for a particular case and to
    calculate the shot effect for free uncorrelated
    electrons
