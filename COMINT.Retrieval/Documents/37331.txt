the influence of grid current upon valve oscillator
    frequency analysis indicates tht when the intensity of
    harmonics in the oscillator anode and grid circuits is low the
    fundamental component of grid current is the main factor
    influencing oscillation frequency grid current harmonics have b
    a greater influence than anode current harmonics
