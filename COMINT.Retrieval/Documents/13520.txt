strict theory of the diffraction of electromagnetic waves
    by plane screens analysis is based on the hertz or fitzgerald
    vector which can be represented by a double fourier integral
    the fourier amplitudes giving the angular distribution of the
    far field are derived from a system of simultaneous integral
    equations which can be solved approximately by developing in
    certain orthogonal systems an alternative method of solutions
    is an iteration process based on the kirchhoff approximation
    the relation with huyghens principle and with the variation
    problem of diffraction theory is established
