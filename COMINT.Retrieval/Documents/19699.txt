a medline feasibility study. a medline feasibility study
    was conducted with the northeastern consortium for health
    information (nechi) and sponsored by the new england regional
    medical library service. it is based on the theory that most
    potential users and supporters of medline within hospitals are
    unaware of its usefulness and applications. the purpose of the
    study was to provide nechi with an evaluation of medline as a
    feasible service by ascertaining the need and by evaluating the
    usefulness, satisfaction, and costs of the system. the study
    demonstrated sufficient use of medline to justify
    implementation within nechi and it provided useful data to
    determine the future of medline in each institution.
