origin of the ionospheric e layer critical discussion of
    theories of formation based on ionization of o by ultraviolet
    light and ionization by solar soft x rays the intensity of
    incoming radiation seems insufficient in view of absorption in
    case but from elwerts computations sufficient in case provided
    dissociation of oc occurs in a high transition layer of
    considerable thickness both processes may be involved but
    process seems the more important
