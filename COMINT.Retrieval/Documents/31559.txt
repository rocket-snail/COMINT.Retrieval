radiation of charged particles in flight past ideally
    conducting bodies the problem is discussed in the
    nonrelativistic approximation and the induced charge and
    currents are calculated initially without considering
    retardation the radiation due to the current system determined
    is then estimated the dipole approximation is used to derive
    expressions for the rate at which energy is radiated the
    radiation resistance for a waveguide system is calculated and
    its dependence on the particle velocity and on the radius
    wavelength ratio is shown graphically
