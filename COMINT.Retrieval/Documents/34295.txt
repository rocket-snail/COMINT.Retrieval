elementary ladder type filters a system of classification
    of conventional ladder type filters based on image parameters
    is described an elementary filter is defined as a network with
    two prescribed image impedances and minimum attenuation these
    are generally composed of conventional half sections but in
    certain cases particularly for band pass filters synthesis
    involves sections with three branched impedances which cannot
    be resolved into matched half sections formulae with examples
    of networks for low pass high pass band pass and band stop
    filters are given in an appendix
