games in the library. games can promote social contact
    and develop powers of thinking and concentration. a minimum
    stock of 20-50 games is recommended, including games for groups
    and individuals, logic and word games and games encouraging
    learning and quick thinking. they can be arranged flat on
    shelves or placed on tables. advice on processing and
    cataloguing is included. each game should be checked thoroughly
    immediately after loan; manufacturers will usually supply spare
    parts if a game is still in production. the presence of games
    in the library should be widely advertised by publicity
    leaflets, notices in the press and, since children are the main
    games users, by contact with youth groups and kindergartens.
    organisation by the library of regular games afternoons often
    proves popular.
