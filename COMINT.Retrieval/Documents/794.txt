the stabilidyne a method for applying the harmonics of a
    quartz crystal oscillator to control the frequency of a
    receiver or transmitter is described for reception the signal
    frequency and a suitable harmonic of the crystal oscillator are
    separately mixed with oscillations from a common local
    oscillator and the two products are then mixed to obtain a
    frequency which is the difference between that of the signal
    and the crystal harmonic stability of the order of with a
    signal frequency of is readily obtained the characteristics of
    several industrial equipments are described
