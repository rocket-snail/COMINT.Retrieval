chemical and biological data-an integrated on-line
    approach. the ici pharmaceuticals division has replaced its
    separate chemical and biological data bases with an integrated
    on-line system for chemical and biological data registration
    and retrieval and biological control. the data base at present
    holds 190,000 chemical compounds from 5 ici divisions, data on
    267 biological tests, and over 1 million biological test
    results from the pharmaceuticals division. a burroughs 6700
    computer is used, linked to 3 terminal computers and 8 visual
    display units. data input and retrieval is described with
    examples.
