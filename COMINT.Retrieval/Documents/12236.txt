the dielectric theory of electronic interactions in
    solids the long range part of the coulomb interaction of the
    electrons in solids is treated by regarding the solid as a
    homogeneous dielectric sustained oscillations are shown to be
    possible in metals and are identified with the plasma
    oscillations discussed by bohm and pines
