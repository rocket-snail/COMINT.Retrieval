the magnetoresistance effect in metals at high
    frequencies the calculation of the effect is based on a model
    in which the electrons occupy two overlapping partially filled
    bands of normal form at low frequencies the relative change in
    surface resistance is independent of frequency and its
    variation with field strength is very similar to that observed
    in dc experiments at high frequencies the effect ultimately
    drops to zero the frequency region in which this occurs being
    determined by the relaxation time for normal metals it lies in
    the far infrared experimental results for bi suggest that the
    relaxation time in bi is abnormally large
