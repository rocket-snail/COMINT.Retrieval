the wave mechanical damped harmonic oscillator a wave
    mechanics treatment is given of damped harmonic motion for the
    charge in a tuned circuit and the em field in a resonant cavity
    the classical frequency appears in the time dependence of the
    eigenfunctions and the classical damping as a decay in the
    eigenvalues
