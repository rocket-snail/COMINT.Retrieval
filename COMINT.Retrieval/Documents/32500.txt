very low frequency noise power from the lightning
    discharge present knowledge about the lightning discharge
    mechanism is reviewed particular attention is paid to the
    theory of bruce and golde of computed power spectra of a nearby
    cloud to ground flash and a distant daytime atmospheric are
    compared taking propagation effects into account of the results
    confirm the presence of a peak at about in the spectra of the
