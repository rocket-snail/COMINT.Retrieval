radioactive charging effects with a dielectric medium the
    characteristics of a cell consisting of a ray source a
    polystyrene dielectric separator and a collector made of carbon
    or metal were investigated radioactive current and voltage
    sources similar to this cell are feasible the arrangement
    offers a simple way of studying the effects of radiation on
    electrical processes in solids
