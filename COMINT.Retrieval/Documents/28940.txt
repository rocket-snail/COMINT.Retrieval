the geographical section of the national central library
    of rome. the national central library of rome possesses a rich
    collection of ancient and modern maps. some 19,000 have been
    collected and catalogued and arranged according to 3 groupings'
    chronologically for maps from 1500 to 1800; by collection for
    maps from official and private bodies; and geographically for
    all the others. in a new re-arrangement, maps will be
    catalogued by a single criterion for every locality and type,
    whether printed or in manuscript. author and topographical
    catalogues will be compiled. transfer of the section to a new
    site has allowed provision for a study room specialising in
    geography, containing author, topographic and concordance
    catalogues for works on display. classification schedules are
    given as an appendix.
