the state of research in library and information science
    in quebec' survey results. in order to fulfill one of the
    elements of the mandate conferred upon it in june 79, the
    research committee in librarianship conducted a survey to find
    out whether quebec librarians are research-minded. the 203
    questionnaires received, studied and analysed, give witness to
    some interesting projects and realisations. but given the time
    and financial constraints and the psychological climate, one
    question remains unanswered' what is the future of research in
    librarianship in quebec?.
