on a feature of galactic radio emission observations of
    the intensity distribution of radio emission have shown a
    bright belt approximately normal to the galactic plane and
    passing through the the anti centre an explanation is suggested
    in terms of the highly anisotropic radiation from relativistic
    electrons moving in the magnetic field of the local spiral arm
    this suggestion avoids the supposition that the sun is in a
    special position in the galaxy
