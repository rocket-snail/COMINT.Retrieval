a coherent theory of relaxation phenomena the theory
    presented is based on the theory of functions general formulae
    are derived and the particular case of elastic relaxation
    oscillations is discussed conditions for the occurrence of
    discrete and of continuous relaxation spectra are determined
    and a formula is derived for the distribution function of the
    continuous spectrum
