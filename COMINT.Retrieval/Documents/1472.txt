the properties of capacitors at high frequencies the
    variations with frequency of the capacitance and loss angle of
    capacitors are deduced from the equivalent circuit the
    frequencies considered ranging up to the television band the
    self resonance frequencies of paper mica and ceramic capacitors
    taking account of wire leads are shown by curves other curves
    show the variation of loss angle with frequency
