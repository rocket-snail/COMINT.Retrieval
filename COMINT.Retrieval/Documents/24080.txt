calculation of the collision frequency in the ionosphere
    it is shown that if is the true reflection height corresponding
    to the lowest frequency of the sounding sweep and is the true
    reflection height corresponding to the first critical frequency
    greater than then provided that the distribution of ion
    concentration and collision frequency are known for values of
    up to and the absorption is observed over the range the
    function expressing the height distribution of collision
    frequency can be determined over the range by solving a an
    integral equation due to abel
