world wide da ly var ations in the height of th maximum
    electron density in the ionospheric f layer the heights given
    by the method of shimazaki of which related and the height of a
    parabolic f layer have been compared with the more correct
    values derived from corresponding profiles the agreement
    between the two methods is quite good during the night in
    middle and low latitudes but during the day in these latitudes
    and for all hours at high latitudes shimazakis relation
    overestimates the height by about km
