present state of theory of electric breakdown in solid
    dielectrics a survey the theory of the first stage of
    dielectric breakdown the loss of electric strength can probably
    be given best in terms of a kinetic equation for electrons in a
    solid the effective cross sections of ionization for low energy
    electrons the probability of scattering of medium energy
    electrons by the vibrating lattice and the effective cross
    section of recombination must be determined the theory of the
    second stage the actual breakdown has not as yet been given it
    is suggested that the cause of the breakdown could be connected
    with processes leading to the production of a shock wave
    analogous to that occurring in the breakdown of gases at high
    pressures references include over to russian literature
