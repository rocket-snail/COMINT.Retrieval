electron trigonometry a new tool for electron optical
    design a method is developed for predicting the image formation
    in electron optical systems as a substitute for trajectory
    tracing it is based on approximating axial potential
    distributions by linear or parabolic segments linear sections
    are replaced by equivalent drift tubes of appropriately scaled
    length parabolic sections observe certain triangle rules for
    the sum of three phase angles of flight applications of the
    method in the design of magnetic and combined lens systems are
    illustrated
