the first order behavior of separable oscillators
    analysis is given for oscillators whose linear and nonlinear
    elements are separable in the first order theoretical and
    experimental results indicate that apart from adjustments of
    the linear elements the major factor for obtaining frequency
    stability and smooth control is the suppression of the even
    power terms in the amplitude characteristic
