on the theory of amplitude distribution of impulsive
    random noise and its application to the atmospheric noise
    atmospheric noise is considered to be a superposition of
    sources of independent randomly occurring poisson noise wave
    packets theoretical amplitude distributions from both discrete
    and continuous spatial distributions of sources are compared
    with actual noise measurements with considerable
    agreement
