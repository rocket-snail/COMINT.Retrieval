radio frequency emission from cosmic ray electrons theory
    developed by schwinger is used for the quantitative
    investigation of the intensity and spectral distribution of rf
    radiation from cosmic ray electrons in interstellar magnetic
    fields an upper limit is deduced for the density of an electron
    component of the cosmic radiation
