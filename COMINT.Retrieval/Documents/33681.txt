an oscillator with constant output voltage the theory and
    design of an uput voltage stabilizer circuit are given by a
    suitable choice of the values of two resistors and of the
    constant reference voltage the oscillator output voltage is
    made virtually independent of valve characteristics and circuit
    impedance an application to the calibration of valve voltmeters
    is described
