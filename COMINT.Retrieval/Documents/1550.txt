response of a low pass or band pass filter to a voltage
    whose instantaneous frequency varies linearly as a function of
    time analysis is given based on a fourier integral
    representation of the input voltage a formula derived for the
    output voltage is shown to be applicable in the case of a
    panoramic receiver in which the frequency is varied by
    in
