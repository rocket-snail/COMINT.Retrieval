photoelectric transformation of mathematical functions
    solution of equations an arrangement comprising a mirror
    galvanometer in combination with an appropriately shaped
    diaphragm and a photocell is used to generate a current when
    the current flows through the galvanometer elaboration of the
    arrangement to generate complex functions is discussed
