synthesis of driving point and transfer functions by
    continued fraction expansion a method of synthesis of driving
    point functions has been developed in which more than one
    network element may be included in each branch of the ladder
    network the method is first applied to rl and lc two element
    type networks and then extended to the general rlc network four
    terminal networks having prescribed driving point and transfer
    impedances are synthesized in a similar manner
