transistor shift registers three different types of high
    speed transistor shift registers are discussed the high speed
    is made possible by the use of nonsaturating bistable circuits
    two general shift registers r are described making use of
    respectively one n and two transistors per stage the third
    register is of a specialized variety capable of shifting a
    single digit in addition an analysis is made of the triggering
    requirements of the register using a single transistor per
    stage
