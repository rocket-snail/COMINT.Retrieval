an asymmetrical finite difference network a study is made
    of a method of solving boundary value problems by means of
    electrical network analogies consideration is given to the
    special problems associated with curved boundaries and with the
    use of meshes of different size at different parts of the
    network a method is described by means of which the
    coefficients of the system of algebraic equations can be
    computed for an arbitrary distribution of node points and the
    position of the nodes can then be chosen to fit the particular
    conditions as an illustration the resonance frequencies and
    field patterns of a conical line cavity resonator are
    calculated
