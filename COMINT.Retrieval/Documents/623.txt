development aid for school libraries-advisory work and
    seminars in the republic of cyprus. in may 81, for the 1st
    time, west germany gave aid to libraries in a developing
    country. in cyprus, school libraries are usually in better
    condition that public libraries. the cypriot librarians asked
    germany for help with problems of insufficient qualified staff,
    outdated and inadequate stocks, shortage of equipment and the
    need to integrate the library into the school curriculum.
    seminars were arranged to provide opportunities for discussion
    and to help library staff to realise the school library's
    educational potential. a report was written for the deutsche
    gesellschaft fur technische zusammenarbeit (the german society
    for technical cooperation) containing suggestions for
    developing school libraries and staff training within the
    framework of national library planning in cyprus, which it is
    hoped will be put to practical use.
