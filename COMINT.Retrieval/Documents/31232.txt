advisory bodies in librarianship and their effectiveness.
    advisory bodies and committees dealing with librarianship in
    slovakia are listed. among the problems tackled are not only
    cataloguing, bibliography and preservation of book collections,
    but also standardisation, research and statistics in libraries,
    as well as continuing education of librarians. special
    committees attend to the running of public and school
    libraries, and also to libraries in higher education. the
    entire network is headed by the slovak library council
    established in the 1950s. the main objective of the council's
    annual plans is to meet the targets set by the slovak ministry
    of culture. following a careful and thorough examination in the
    course of the current 5 year plan (1981-85), measures will be
    taken to ensure unification of all advisory activities and to
    increase their impact on libraries.
