will viewdata systems be used in education?. an
    introduction to viewdata systems is provided as a basis for
    studying their potential for educational use. the bbc are
    already conducting experiments to use ceefax in education and
    costs are expected to fall as application becomes more
    widespread. viewdata systems are considered to be versatile and
    will probably be used most in specialised education rather than
    the more general field. future enhancements should include
    microprocessor-controlled terminals connected in clusters over
    a single telephone line, improved graphics facilities, and the
    linking of small in-house systems to the national prestel
    network as more educational institutions acquire their own
    computers.
