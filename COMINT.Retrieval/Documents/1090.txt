comparing fiche and film' a test of speed. speeds of
    searching microfilm and microfiche com catalogues were measured
    and compared. searching of motorised microfilm catalogued was
    found to be significantly faster than searching microfiche for
    inexperienced users. the slowest film time was faster than most
    fiche times. results suggested, however, that frequent users
    might improve their searching times and may then be able to
    search fiche faster than film.
