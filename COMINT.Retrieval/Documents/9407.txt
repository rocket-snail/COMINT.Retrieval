microform copies and aacr2' a note. the anglo-american
    cataloguing rules (2nd edition) draws no distinction between
    microforms which constitute original publications and
    microforms issued as copies of works originally produced in
    hard copy. the us library of congress is reverting to aacr 1
    practice, whereby the 'body of the entry' describes the
    original hard copy version with the description of the
    microform version appearing as a note. these different
    approaches are discussed.
