a new quartz oscillator for the frequency range a quartz
    oscillator in the form of a tuning fork is described each prong
    carries four electrodes arranged according to the cut of the
    crystal and connected so that on application of a voltage via
    the spring suspensions the inner and outer halvex of each prong
    are stressed in opposite directions in air the q factor is
    increasing to at a pressure of a few mm hg with thermostatic
    control the frequency variation can be kept to within part
    in
