relaxation time and multiple pumping effects in masers
    optimization of relaxation times combined with multiple pumping
    cannot by itself extend the operation of masers past the liquid
    nitrogen range without degrading the performance below that now
    attainable at liquid helium temperatures with three level
    masers
