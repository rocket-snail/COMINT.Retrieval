lumpsed parameter delay lines the application of rigorous
    filter theory to delay lines comprising a series of coaxial
    coils is difficult owing to the coupling between nonadjacent
    coils an experimental method of obtaining frequency
    characteristics is outlined the latter can be corrected by
    connecting a capacitor across adjacent coils filter theory is
    applied to give an indication of suitable capacitance
