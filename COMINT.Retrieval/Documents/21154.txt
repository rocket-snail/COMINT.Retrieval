electromagnetic potentials in a heterogeneous
    nonconducting medium for em fields in a stationary
    nonconducting medium isotropic or anisotropic the dielectric
    constant and permeability of which are given point functions
    the general theory of representations in terms of scalar and
    vector potentials and of hertzian potentials is
    developed
