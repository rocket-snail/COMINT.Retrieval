sudden commencements of magnetic storms and atmospheric
    dynamo action statistical analysis of world wide magnetic data
    discloses an appreciable diurnal change in the amplitude of scs
    the average electric current system for the disturbance diurnal
    variation shows marked concentrations in polar regions and
    suggests that the system exists within the earths atmosphere
    while the current system of the storm time variation would
    appear more likely to be of extra terrestrial origin a dynamo
    theory is applied to explain the atmospheric part of magnetic
    disturbances and a consistent wind system is obtained to
    produce current systems for magnetically quiet and disturbed
    days this system contains diurnal and semi diurnal terms and
    its order of magnitude agrees with recent ionospheric wind
