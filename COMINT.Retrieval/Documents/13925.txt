controlled rectification using transistors the
    suitability of a transistor as a switching device is discussed
    in terms of its operating characteristics and an equivalent
    circuit is derived a switched rectifier circuit for use in a
    chopper type d c amplifier is described which incorporates a
    transistor oscillator providing the control frequency
