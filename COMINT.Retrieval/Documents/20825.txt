behaviour of saturable reactors in magnetic amplifiers a
    detailed analysis is presented of the behaviour of a magnetic
    amplifier in which the core material is assumed to have a
    square characteristic systems with single cores two series
    connected cores and two parallel connected cores are considered
    with sources of infinite and low impedance results are
    presented graphically upporting experimental evidence is
    mentioned briefly
