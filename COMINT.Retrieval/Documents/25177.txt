the future of the archive profession in quebec: training,
    education and research. the archive profession in quebec
    currently faces a state of crisis because of lack of finance,
    personnel, and provision for training. to demonstrate both the
    necessity for and the feasibility of establishing a course in
    archive studies, parallels are drawn with document management
    in general, showing the similarities of the tasks involved and
    the interdependence of the 2 fields of operation. a programme
    of studies which would serve for both is outlined. the
    professional associations are urged to provide support for
    archive training, and recommendations made to government to
    ensure a secure future for private and public archives in the
    province.
