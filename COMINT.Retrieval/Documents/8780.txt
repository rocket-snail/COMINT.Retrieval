the bridge stabilized transformerless oscillator with
    complex amplification factor oscillators of the type described
    by zaiser of with rc frequency determining circuits are
    discussed the effect of complex transfer factor is investigated
    and the conditions are determined under which oscillations at
    unwanted frequencies are suppressed without impairing the
    frequency stability of the wanted oscillation
