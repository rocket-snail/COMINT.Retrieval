exploration of the upper atmosphere with the help of the
    third soviet sputnik the instruments carried are described and
    some of the preliminary results of observations are given up to
    km the principal ionospheric constituent is nitric oxide above
    this height ions of atomic oxygen and nitrogen become more
    important electron density falls off slowly above the f region
    maximum positive ion density at a height of km is about ie
    about half the corresponding electron density the number of
    collisions with micrometeorites at heights of km is
