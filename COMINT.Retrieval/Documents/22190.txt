on the origin of solar flares the high concentration of
    energy stored in the chromosphere can be accounted for by a
    particular class of magnetic field whose lines of force have
    the general shape of twisted loops protruding above the
    photosphere when loops of opposite sense and twist meet energy
    is dissipated in the form of a solar flare
