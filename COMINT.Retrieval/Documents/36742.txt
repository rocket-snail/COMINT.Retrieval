cooperation between the library and the stei (scientific,
    technical and economic information) systems within the region.
    can it be put into practice?. cooperation between the library
    and the stei systems within a region is a long standing
    problem, the aim of which has always been the paramount right
    of the reader to have access to all available literature
    sources. although the ministry of culture together with the
    czechoslovak state library published in 1974 'principles of the
    development of a unified library system in the czechoslovak
    socialist republic', it remained only methodological advice.
    there is simply not enough cooperation. the spheres in which
    this should be started are considered.
