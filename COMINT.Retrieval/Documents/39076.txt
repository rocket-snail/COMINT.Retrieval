electrical breakdown of air at small and medium
    overvoltages experimental results indicate that values of
    pressure distance about torr cm breakdown due to overvoltages
    of to is produced by a townsend ionization mechanism rather
    than by the electron avalanche build up of a channel as
    described by raether at overvoltages the latter process is
    operative
