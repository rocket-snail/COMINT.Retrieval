scattering of electromagnetic waves from concentric
    infinite cylinders the solution for the scattering of radiant
    energy in the form of electromagnetic waves by concentric
    isotropic infinitely long circular cylinders is given for the
    incident energy travelling perpendicular to the cylinder
    axis
