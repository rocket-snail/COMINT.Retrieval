definition of magnetic quantities a critical examination
    is made of the nomenclature hitherto used for magnetic
    quantities and proposals are made for definitions which fit in
    with modern ideas without unnecessarily disturbing established
    usage precise definitions are given of field strength
    polarization magnetization susceptibility and
    magnetizability
