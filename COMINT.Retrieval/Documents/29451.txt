a broadband low level error voltage detector the
    unbalance of a carrier frequency voltage in a bridge circuit
    having two inductive and two ge diode arms is used for
    detecting small dc or ac error signals sensitivity down to and
    response within are provided by the instrument which is
    relatively free from zero drift application to high speed
    multichannel sampling and to servo systems is discussed
