measurements of ionospheric electron content by the lunar
    radio technique measurements of the faraday rotation of lunar
    radio echoes are used to determine the time variation in the
    total ionospheric electron content absolute values of electron
    content are derived from data on the electron content below the
    f peak computed from vertical incidence experiments
