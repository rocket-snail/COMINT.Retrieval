amplifier stages with transitionally coupled two stage
    band pass filters particularly for large bandwidths the
    amplitude and group delay characteristics of an amplifier stage
    consisting of two coupled circuits are analysed for the case
    when the amplification is constant over a wide frequency band
    transitional coupling the case when the damping factors d and d
    of the two circuits are equal is considered first and formulae
    are also given for the cases of either d or d tending to zero
    formulae are also given for transforming a filter with indirect
    inductive coupling into one with direct inductive coupling
    design curves are shown
