theory and examples of application of a circuit element
    with distributed resistance and distributed capacitance the
    component considered consists of a ceramic plate of high
    dielectric constant with a resistive coating on one side and a
    highly conductive coating on the other side this circuit
    element is equivalent to an infinite number of cascade
    connected filter sections applications discussed include a low
    pass and a rejection filter and a frequency control element for
    an oscillator
