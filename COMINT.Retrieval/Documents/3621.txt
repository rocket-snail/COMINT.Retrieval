radio scintillations of satellite graphical recordings of
    the signal from satellite are reproduced the scintillations
    observed are correlated with scintillations of cosmic rf
    sources recorded during the same period results indicate that
    the ionospheric irregularities responsible for the
    scintillations must lie below km corresponding recordings from
    satellite show significantly less scintillation activity at
    perigee than on preceding and following days
