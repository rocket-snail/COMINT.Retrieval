local authority library planning cannot be abandoned.
    local authorities are legally bound to provide library
    services. the widest possible area should be covered by a
    library network, involving cooperation not only with other
    local authorities but also with other library administrators,
    e.g. the churches and industry. libraries are also important as
    community meeting-places and as educational and cultural
    centres. in many areas minimum standards of library provision
    have not yet been attained. some people call for state
    legislation to improve the library service but this would cause
    too many complications. cultural administration should be
    distinguished by its autonomy and freedom from compulsion by
    the state.
