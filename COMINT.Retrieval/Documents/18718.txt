the characteristic frequencies of negative molecular ions
    of oxygen between and observed in ionized air discharge tubes
    absorption frequencies are determined from the current
    variations in a coil round a discharge tube containing pure air
    supplemented in some cases by at pressures of absorption
    frequencies above give rise to strong absorption at pressures
    below mm hg
