generating random noise with radioactive sources the
    system comprises a radio active isotope mixed with a light
    emitting phosphor and a type photomultiplier tube it was
    designed for application with a repetitive analogue computer
    and provides both a random telegraph wave with a mean count
    rate of and gaussian noise with a power spectrum
