skin and spiralling effect in stranded conductors
    discussion an analysis is made to determine the ac resistance
    and internal reactance of stranded conductors with or without a
    magnetic core at power frequencies assuming current density
    constant in individual strands the spiralling of strands tends
    to reduce skin effect data calculated for standard copper
    conductors with parallel and spiralled strands are
    listed
