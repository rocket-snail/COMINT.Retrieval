automated text processing as an aid to rationalising
    purchasing and stock administration in documentation. formerly
    most information had to be obtained from original documents,
    resulting in the recovery of only a few coincidental
    references. the use of on-line techniques facilitates the
    making of global information surveys independent of sources at
    hand. automated text processing reduces the need for direct
    contact with published material and maintenance of original
    stocks. the sulzer company uses automated text processing in
    ordering and supply of information, for the catalogue,
    accessions index, periodical subscription control and printing
    the periodical index; the computer system is described in
    detail. control of periodical circulation is also being
    incorporated into the system. thus work procedures have been
    reduced, leaving staff free for more demanding tasks.
