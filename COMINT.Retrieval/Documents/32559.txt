topological centric coding and nomenclature of polycyclic
    hydrocarbons. 1. condensed benzenoid systems (polyhexes,
    fusenes). on the basis of the focal numbering of each benzenoid
    ring in the graphite lattice, any polyhex (cata-, peri, and
    corona-fused polycyclic benzenoid system) can be coded by
    making use of (1) the dualist graph of the polyhex and (2) the
    recent generalisation of the topological centre concept. the
    numerical code can be used for nomenclature purposes, and the
    present approach can be easily generalised to condensed
    nonbenzenoid systems as will be shown in future
    publications.
