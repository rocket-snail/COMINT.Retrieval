on the art of management in academic libraries' a
    prolegomenon. discusses 3 aspects of the academic library
    manager's responsibility' managing relations of the library
    with the rest of the institution (involving the library in the
    formulation and implementation of institional objectives);
    managing conflicts within the library (the most appropriate
    attitude being a consultative administrative style
    distinguished by the development of authority rather than
    reliance on legislated power); and managing changes wrought by
    technology (perceiving technology as a more efficient means for
    obtaining the library's traditional goals).
