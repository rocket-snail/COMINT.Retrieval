journal acquisition and cost-effectiveness in a special
    library' a case study. brookes' model, based on traditional
    bradford's approach, as a quantification method, has some
    loopholes which can be overcome by ranking journals considering
    both productivity and subscription cost. this paper reports
    such a study. the major findings are 1) this method is a
    further improvement and rationalisation of brookes' method and
    traditional bradford's approach. 2) there is a steady decrease
    in the value of rupee in terms of yield of relevant papers and
    thus journal acquisition reaches the point of diminishing
    returns at a certain stage. 3) there is a significant
    difference in the 2 ranked lists.
