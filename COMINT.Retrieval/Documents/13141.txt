art to the people. argues that libraries have an
    important role to play in making the public familiar with art.
    the 1964 danish library act made it possible to develop art
    departments and several larger libraries took advantage of
    this, lending mostly prints, posters and slides. this
    development has now stagnated owing to various misconceptions.
    thus art need not be placed in special buildings only visited
    by highly motivated people. a library should begin by lending
    posters, which are easy to handle, and then proceed to prints.
    art need not be expensive, a poster costing no more than a
    book, and large collections are not necessary. whereas
    acquisition of posters is simple, prints and slides demand more
    attention as central aids to selection of material are lacking.
    exhibitions are important for widening people's conception of
    art. regrets that the new danish library bill omits any mention
    of art.
