spin echo serial storage memory methods are discussed for
    storing information in the form of pulses in a nuclear magnetic
    resonance system by use of the free induction spin echo
    technique th storage capacity in liquids is expressed in terms
    of the thermal noise of the detecting apparatus the self
    diffusion of the molecules and the relaxation times undesired
    echoes arising from the interaction of input pulses are
    eliminated by and magnetic field modulation techniques glycerin
    and solutions of paramagnetic ions in water provide storage
    times of with a storage capacity of the order of echoes larger
    capacities expected from liquids with long relaxation times are
    not realized owing to self diffusion
