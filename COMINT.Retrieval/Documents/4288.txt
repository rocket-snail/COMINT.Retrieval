a controlled frequency oscillator with frequency memory
    an arrangement is described in which a phase comparison afc
    system is used to keep a first oscillator in tune with a second
    pilot oscillator at a given instant the control loop is broken
    thereafter the first oscillator continues to operate at the
    frequency at the cut off instant and subsequent frequency
    variations of the pilot oscillator are determined from
    measurements of the phase difference between the two
    oscillators a practical circuit which holds frequencies in a
    band centered on is described
