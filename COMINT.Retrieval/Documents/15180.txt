questions of library didactics. the comprehensive school
    library at kassel-waldau, which is also a public library, is a
    pilot project in the kassel area. instruction in library use is
    part of the school curriculum. introductory talks are given in
    the classrooms by teachers, after which the librarian provides
    about 10 hours of basic instruction in the library on media,
    use of catalogues and library procedures. then children work in
    the library, finding material on subjects of interest and
    preparing little talks on them. librarian and teachers advise
    on choice of material and the best ways of extracting
    information. close cooperation between librarian and teachers
    is essential. teachers receive instruction on school libraries
    at regional advanced training conferences.
