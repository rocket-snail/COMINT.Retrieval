the connection between transverse magnetogalvaniic
    effects and resistivity the magnetogalvanic rotation due to the
    hall effect in an isotropic conductor is expressed in terms of
    transverse magnetogalvanic conductivity its variation with
    temperature and field intensity is discussed briefly with
    reference to ferromagnetic and super conducting media
