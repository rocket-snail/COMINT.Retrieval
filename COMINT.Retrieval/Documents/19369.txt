confutation of the ortega hypothesis by citation
    analysis. part 1. a case study of method criticism. 1st part of
    a 2 part study which provides a detailed critical analysis of
    cole and cole's paper (2science, 1(178) 1972, 368-375) in which
    by means of citation index analysis, the authors confuted the
    ortega y gasset hypothesis of scientific progress which, they
    say, attributes much of the growth of science to the work of
    the average scientist who, it is suggested, has paved the way
    with his 'small' discoveries for the men of genius. the case
    study points out the incompetent application of citation index
    analysis as a research method.
