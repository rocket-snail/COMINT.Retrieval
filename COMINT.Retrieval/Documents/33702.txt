contribution to the mathematical description of
    relaxation oscillations differences and similarities between
    oscillations of relaxation and of van der pol type are
    discussed relaxation oscillations can be represented by the van
    der pol equation if th self inductance term in the latter is
    neglected and a suitable transformation is made
