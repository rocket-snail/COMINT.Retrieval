a diode capacitor memory for high speed electronic
    computers ordinary linear capacitors are used as rapid access
    storage elements in a matrix arrangement the basic circuit
    consists of two diodes in series with the anode of one
    connected to the cathode of the other and the capacitor
    connected to the junction the other end of the capacitor is
    used for reading and writing and is connected to earth through
    a resistor
