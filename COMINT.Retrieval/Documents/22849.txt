the phase bistable transistor circuit properties of
    transistor switching circuits are discussed a unit is described
    which comprises a commutating ring of two transistors each
    connected as a one shot multi vibrator the two being
    alternately triggered by a series of clock pulses the
    arrangement is used in a binary counter with a clock pulse
