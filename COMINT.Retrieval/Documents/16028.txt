a precision direct current stabilizer a dc stabilizer is
    described which delivers stable to a few parts in a
    degenerative feedback system is used with a contact modulator
    amplifier self oscillation being prevented and the frequency
    response improved by an auxiliary ac feedback loop facilities
    for monitoring the stability are provided
