index of refraction above feet calculations are made on
    the basis of refractive index measurements reported by in
    conjunction with relevant meteorological data to an accuracy
    within only the density of the air has any significant effect
    in relation to refractive index variations at and only at
    altitudes up to variations due to water vapour content and
    electrons in the ionosphere are negligible thus for practical
    purposes a standard refractive index can be based on a standard
    density distribution
