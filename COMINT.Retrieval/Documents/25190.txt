information theory and information science. the empirical
    import of shannon's information theory and its impact on
    information science are discussed. it is argued that extension
    of the scope of information theory as well as development of
    new theories of information science presupposes better
    understanding of relevant empirical regularities and laws.
    possibilities of broadening the empirical foundation of
    information theory by introduction of appropriate least effort
    criteria are discussed.
