measurement of the arrival angle of whistlers it is
    suggested that storeys theory on the origin of whistling
    atmospherics could be tested by determining their arrival angle
    by a phase measurement method based on that of using a pair of
    aerials spaced apart along the direction of the horizontal
    component of the geomagnetic field
