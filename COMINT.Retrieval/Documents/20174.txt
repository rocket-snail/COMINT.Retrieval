reflection of electromagnetic waves from a plasma moving
    in slow wave waveguides report of an experimental investigation
    carried out at using a a helix slow wave structure to reduce
    the phase velocity of the waves to the double doppler effect
    observed in reflection from a plasma piston increased the
    frequency by application of the effect for microwave
    amplification and frequency multiplication is indicated
