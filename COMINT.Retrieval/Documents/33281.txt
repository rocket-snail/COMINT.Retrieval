a low frequency pulse generator with independent control
    of pulse shape and pulse frequency a modified multivibrator
    circuit is described in which the pulse repetition frequency is
    controlled by a variable resistance in the control grid circuit
    of a heptode and the pulse duration by the voltage on a second
    control grid the screen voltage being stabilized the circuit
    shown can be used with the photoformer described by sunstein to
    generate pulses of any shape with repetition frequency variable
    between and pulses and pulse duration
