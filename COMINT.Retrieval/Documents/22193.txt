the contribution of library and information services to
    the economic exploitation and cultural development of the
    urals, siberia and the far east. the library service in these
    areas is young, but statistics of usage show a rapid growth.
    the need for well-trained staff and for adequate transport have
    been key factors in its development. libraries there specialise
    in information relevant to the exploitation of the area's
    natural resources and to such projects as the baikal-amur
    railway, in the bibliographical control of locally-produced
    material and in local history studies. requirements for
    improving the service include' (1) a more balanced geographical
    distribution of service points; (2) the redistribution of some
    stock to ensure better usage; (3) the discovery, collection and
    circulation of more local material; (4) better cooperation
    between both libraries and local museums.
