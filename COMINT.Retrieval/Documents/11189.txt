sound cassettes in the library. (iv) religious cassettes
    in the library. the range of cassettes on religious subjects
    available on the market is relatively small. some religious
    material is only available on records, which are less useful
    than cassettes in libraries, but the products of a few
    important manufacturers should form the basis of a library's
    stock. manufacturers' lists provide the only source of
    information for the librarian since no comprehensive topical
    index of religious cassettes exists. cassette material
    available in germany containing bible readings and
    dramatisations, talks on the catholic faith, the christian way
    of life, meditation and prayer is described. each cassette
    should be examined individually concerning its subject content,
    aims, suitability for the target group and the quality of
    music, language and technical production. (for previous parts,
    see 82/5287, 82/5291 and 82/5288).
