scattering of electromagnetic waves from a random surface
    the medium below the surface is assumed to be perfectly
    conducting so that the far zone form of the stratton chu
    solution can be used the mean and covariance of the approximate
    expression for the scattered radiation are determined for both
    vertical and horizontal polarization
