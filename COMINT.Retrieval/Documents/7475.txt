relating mutagenicity to chemical structure. a computer
    program correlating chemical structure with mutagenesis
    activity has been developed as a predictive test for hazard
    evaluation. sets of substructural units are derived from
    complete structures, and the probability that a structure
    containing a given unit will have a designated category of
    activity is calculated. the program, validated by bacterial
    mutagenesis testing, is capable of identifying similar
    structures, showing why they are similar, and estimating the
    activity of a structure.
