investigations by microscope and oscillograph of the
    electroluminescence of nonconducting diamonds the
    electroluminescence is investigated at fields strengths above
    cm with very strong fields and high current densities graphite
    whiskers form in the diamond at the electrodes and the
    electroluminescence is thereby enhanced oscillograms indicate
    that recombination processes are a contributory cause of
    electroluminescence
