neutralization of ions and ionization of atoms near metal
    surfaces when an ion or an atom approaches a metal surface
    neutralization or ionization processes are often possible the
    franck condon principle is applied in the determination of the
    probability of electron transfer such transfers are limited to
    definite ranges of separation from the surface most secondary
    electron emission is due to an auger type process the
    contribution due to de excitation of metastable atoms being
    very small
