the serials department. analyses the different
    organisational structures and areas of responsibility of
    serials departments, looking in particular at the current
    practices in australian tertiary libraries. in most libraries,
    the organisational structure appears to be based on factors
    such as historical accidents, special circumstances, personnel
    arrangements, or architectural constraints, and not on any
    administrative decision taken on the basis of an understanding
    of the special factors involved in serials work. with shrinking
    budgets reinforcing the trend towards library cooperation and
    automation, libraries will need to review their organisational
    structures to suit future technology.
