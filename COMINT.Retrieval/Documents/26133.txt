a voltage tuned resistance capacitance oscillator a
    circuit is given for an oscillator whose frequency of
    oscillation is dependent on an applied potential by vartue of
    the variable capacitance of selenium drydisk rectifiers with
    reverse bias the characteristics of suitable rectifiers are
    discussed
