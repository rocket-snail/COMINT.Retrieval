the library of the hamburg chamber of commerce. there has
    been a commercial library in hamburg since 1735. stocks include
    about 140,000 books and over 500 german and foreign language
    periodicals; about 3,000 items are added annually. although
    much material was destroyed in world war ii the library is
    still valuable to business people, students and research
    workers. subjects covered include economics, social science,
    commercial law, politics and psychology. the proximity of the
    university library obviates the need for comprehensive subject
    coverage, which is an advantage owing to the increased number
    of publications, the current financial crisis and the growth of
    new subjects like environmental protection. traditional manual
    processing methods are still found to be effective here,
    although electronic data processing may be implemented
    later.
