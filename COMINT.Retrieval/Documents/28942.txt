washington county cooperative library services network.
    oregon's washington county cooperative library services network
    began as an informal basis in 1974 with a union list of serials
    for interlibrary borrowing. this prompted funding for a study
    of cooperation among libraries in the county. a study by
    phyllis i. dalton set guidelines for getting a cooperative
    effort going and a pilot project was begun. programmes
    initiated included' books-by-mail; countywide courier service;
    back-up reference service; store-front community libraries; and
    a rotating cassette programme. today wccls operates on a
    countywide serial levy and awaits automation and cable tv as
    the ultimate answer to a full cooperative effort.
