theory of parametric amplification using nonlinear
    reactances the parametric amplifier is analysed
    phenomenologically in terms of an equivalent circuit model the
    model consists of a signal circuit resonant at an idling
    circuit at and a pumping circuit at these three circuits being
    coupled across a nonlinear inductance the analysis is general
    enough to delineate the conditions on the signal level and
    circuit parameters which lead to distortionless amplification
    expressions are derived for power gain bandwidth and noise
    factor for the case in which the signal and idling frequencies
    are well separated and for the degenerate case in which these
    two frequencies are equal
