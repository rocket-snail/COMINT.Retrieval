bradford's law of bibliographic scatter. analyses the
    ambiguity inherent in bradford's law, and attributes this to
    the inconsistencies between the verbal and graphical forms of
    its expression. demonstrates how bradford's law can be
    rewritten so that theory and empirical results will correspond
    exactly. to extend the practical use of such a mathematical
    model, introduces the concepts of normal situation and
    normalisation of research, and uses zipf's 2nd law to establish
    a model valid for normal situations but with wider application
    and greater objectivity than bradford's.
