the scientific journal' current trends and prospects. the
    primary journal has been the most important formal medium for
    the dissemination of scientific information for over 3
    centuries. a number of criticisms can be levelled against it
    viz. the publication process is time consuming and expensive
    while journal proliferation ensures the scattering of related
    information. recent innovations such as computer-aided
    production, microform publication and letter and synopsis
    journals have attempted to overcome these drawbacks.
    alternatives to the traditional journal such as the
    computer-based editorial processing centre and the electronic
    journal have been mooted and are considered viable in the near
    future although it is likely that they will be resisted by the
    scientific community.
