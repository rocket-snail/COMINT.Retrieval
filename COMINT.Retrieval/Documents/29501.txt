theory of ferromagnetic anisotropy by means of a virial
    theorem and perturbation theory the anisotropy energy of a
    ferromagnetic crystal is expressed in terms of the coulomb
    energy alone this is approximated by a multipole expansion and
    the anisotropy constants are given in terms of electric
    multipole moments and crystalline potential constants the
    multipole moments which arise from the orbital angular momentum
    induced by spin orbit coupling have been estimated from the
    known values of angular momentum
