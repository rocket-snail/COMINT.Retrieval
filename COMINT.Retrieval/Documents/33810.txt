for american librarians trade unions are not a great
    attraction. interviews marion porro, president of the trade
    union for library employees in new york. the organisation of
    library employees in the usa has not been very successful and
    today only about 10% of employees, mostly in the large urban
    public libraries, are union members. this is, however, in line
    with the general scepticism towards the trade union movement
    among americans in general and the professions in particular.
    the ala has on the whole had an ambiguous attitude to trade
    union matters. the trade union in new york, the new york
    library guild, or local 1930, established in 1968, has about
    1500 members and almost total coverage. it negotiates 2 yearly
    agreements on pay and conditions and deals with grievances, but
    does not participate in the library professional
    decision-making. on a wider front, the union is engaged in
    various social protest movements, but no cooperation with other
    trade unions for library employees takes pl ace.
