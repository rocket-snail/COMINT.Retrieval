frequency jumps and pulling effects in coupled circuits
    the admittance equations for two coupled tuned circuits are
    formulated and the conditions of oscillation established the
    minimum width of the frequency jump is derived as a function of
    coupling and in relation to the pulling properties of the
    oscillator the limiting conditions for freedom from frequency
    jumps are given
