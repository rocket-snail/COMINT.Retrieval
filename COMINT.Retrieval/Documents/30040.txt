a simple method of coupling toroidal coils theory is
    given of a method of coupling suitable for the low values of
    coupling coefficient usually required for if transformers fm
    discriminators and in some types of filter the coupling coils
    with very few turns are wound on a separate toroidal core each
    being connected in series with one of the toroidal coils to be
    coupled in a simplified version a coupling coil of one or two
    turns connected in series with one toroidal coil is wound on
    top of the other toroidal coil such a transformer may be
    accommodated in a cube with the toroids close together with no
    shield between them
