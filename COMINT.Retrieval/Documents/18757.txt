the steady state of the chapman ferraro problem in two
    dimensions the form of the cavity in the plane of the dipole
    and uniform solar stream is derived using the method of complex
    potentials large scale electron bombardment of the atmosphere
    at the sudden commencement of a geomagnetic storm x ray bursts
    coincident in time with two sudden commencement peaks in
    magnetic records were observed with balloon borne geiger
    counters ionospheric absorption data are given an estimate is
    made of the electron flux required to account for the x ray
    intensities and their origin is discussed
