the response of a tuned circuit to a ramp function a ramp
    function is defined as one whose value increases linearly up to
    a certain point and then remains constant response curves are
    shown for a parallel tuned lrc circuit subjected to a linearly
    increasing driving force ramp voltages with various rise times
    in each case curces are given for circuit q values of
    and
