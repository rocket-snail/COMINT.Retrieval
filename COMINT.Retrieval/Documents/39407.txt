helical winding slow wave structures in exponential line
    pulse transformer a description is given of an experimental
    pulse transformer with integral hydrogen thyratron pulse
    generator suitable for use at the high impedance levels
    required in pulsed operation of magnetrons the transformer has
    an outer cylindrical shell the inner conductor consisting of a
    helix of constant diameter whose pitch decreases gradually from
    the thyratron end overall length is input impedance and output
    impedance
