measurement of the relaxation time by modulation of the
    radio frequency field and detection of the he variation of
    magnetization with the controlling field an extension of the
    method described by whitfield and redfield of is proposed using
    a much higher modulating frequency under these conditions
    variations in the signal induced in the pick up coil may be
    used to determine three methods of detecting the signal are
    examined
