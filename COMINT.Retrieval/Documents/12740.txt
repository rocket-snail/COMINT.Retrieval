polis' parliamentary online information system. mps at
    the british house of commons have urgent information needs. the
    house of commons library produces 9 strip indexes of
    information, but these have disadvantages, in that entries
    usually appear under 1 heading, only selected parliamentary
    questions have been indexed, and the library's 3 locations make
    access difficult. in 1979 a new data base was begun, and it
    will form a single index to all material previously held on
    strip indexes, and other information such as parliamentary
    questions. describes the input flow for the new on-line data
    base-polis, and details of the system configuration are
    given.
