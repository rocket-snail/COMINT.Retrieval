the collision frequency of electrons in the ionosphere
    theoretical analysis indicates that the electron collision
    frequency in the ionosphere depends on the concentration of
    neutral particles in the d and e regions and on the electron
    concentration in the f region any atmospheric model for the
    region above the e layer should not therefore be based on the
    frequency of electron collisions with neutral particles
