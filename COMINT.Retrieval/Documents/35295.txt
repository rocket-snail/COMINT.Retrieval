microwave cavity resonators some perturbation effects and
    their applications first order perturbation theory is used to
    examine the change in resonance frequency and q of a cavity due
    to a small deformation of the wall an expression is derived for
    the coupling coefficient between the two degenerate modes h and
    e in the absence of perturbation these two modes can co exist
    applications of the theory to measurements of dielectric
    properties study of ferromagnetic resonance etc are
    described
