plans for an on-line catalog at the university of
    illinois. the increasing size, cost, and complexity of the card
    catalogue has caused the library of the university of illinois
    at urbana-champaign to begin planning for an on-line public
    catalogue. the library has decided to use the software of the
    washington library network (wln) as the basis for an on-line
    catalogue while continuing to use oclc as a source of
    bibliographic records. the plans for replicating the wln
    software at illinois as an on-line catalogue and the
    implications of this for statewide resource sharing are
    discussed.
