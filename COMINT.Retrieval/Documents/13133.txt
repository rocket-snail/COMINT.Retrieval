for good or evil, librarianship is sterile. librarians
    fail to attract the right people to their ranks; they are
    neither inventive nor innovative, there is too little in
    librarianship to justify even a first degree; only librarians
    themselves would consider their occupation to be a profession;
    and fellowship should be reserved for award on an honorary
    basis (and then only rarely). librarianship should recognise
    its modest place in society, recruit those with a natural flair
    for organisation, and organise itself along businesslike lines
    to provide a service the nature of which does not need
    explicating except to those more interested in abstract
    philosophy than practical utility. librarianship is much more
    interested in rhetoric than logic.
