collector bias the transistor equivalent of cathode bias
    and some applications a self bias circuit for stabilizing the
    operating point of a transistor amplifier without unduly
    decreasing the gain at very low frequencies is discussed
    expressions for the frequency response stability and input
    impedance are derived and the application of the circuit to
    amplifiers oscillators and active filters is considered
