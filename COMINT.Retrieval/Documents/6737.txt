connections between accuracy and stability properties of
    linear multistep formulas this paper is concerned with
    stability and accuracy of families of linear k-step formulas
    depending on parameters, with particular emphasis on the
    numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations. an
    upper bound, p=k, is derived for the order of accuracy of
    a(inf)-stable formulas. three criteria are given for
    a(0)-stability. it is shown that (1) for p=k, k arbitrary,
    a(inf)-stability implies certain necessary conditions for
    a(0)-stability and for strict stability (meaning that the
    extraneous roots of p(psi) satisfy |psi|<1); (2) for
    p=k=2,3,4,and 5, a(inf)-stability (for k=5 together with
    another constraint) implies strict stability; and (3) for
    certain one-parameter classes of formulas with p=k=3,4,and/or
    5, a(inf)-stability implies a(0)-stability. january, 1975
