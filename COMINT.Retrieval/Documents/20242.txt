the library union in hamburg. in 1978 a cooperative
    scheme was inaugurated between the combined state and
    university library and over 100 institute and departmental
    libraries of the colleges of technology to produce a union
    catalogue and organise cooperative purchasing of books and
    periodicals. the scheme has also been joined by the technical
    university at hamburg-harburg and will ultimately include other
    libraries in north germany. work on the union catalogue has
    begun with the university's periodicals, for which electronic
    data processing is used. changes in the data processing system
    will shortly be made and more work is needed on hardware and
    software. more space and money will be needed as the scheme
    expands.
