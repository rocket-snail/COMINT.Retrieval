the spectrum of the electron density fluctuations in the
    ionosphere the fluctuations are assumed to arise from the
    vertical transport of small pockets of air in the presence of a
    non adiabatic temperature gradient and vertical gradients o
    mean electron density a preliminary account of the theory of
    the spectrum o the fluctuations is given with references to the
    application of the results to ionospheric and tropospheric
