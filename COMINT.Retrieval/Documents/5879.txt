authority control' unnecessary detail of needed support?.
    authority control is the set of procedures which determines the
    use of consistent names and terminology, changing relationships
    among scholarly disciplines, corporate bodies, and government
    agencies. gives examples of authority work for personal names,
    corporate names, government agencies, series titles and subject
    headings. suggests that authority control is essential because'
    catalogues are growing and becoming more difficult to use so
    the user may easily get lost without an authority structure to
    provide guidance; and if libraries follow generally the same
    standards in establishing bibliographic records, the task of
    matching records among libraries will be made considerably
    easier.
