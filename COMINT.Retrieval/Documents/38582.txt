avoiding the worst' the 29th conference of the state
    library centres in burghausen. report of the conference held in
    sept/oct 81, with a central theme of literature provision for
    rural areas. subjects covered included' the foreseeable and
    unforeseeable aspects of library planning; the tasks and
    functions of public libraries at different levels of spatial
    planning; and literature provision within rural cultural
    development. warnings were given against emergency solutions
    provided without professional expertise and against resignation
    in the face of difficulties. a broadly based, decentralised
    lending system should cater for both general and specialised
    requirements. the state should support and complement local
    library services but refrain from excessive interference in
    them. bavaria is the state that has made most progress in this
    direction; its state development programme reflects the
    importance of systematic planning.
