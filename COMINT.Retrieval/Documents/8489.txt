on explanations of electric and magnetic constants and
    units using dimensional methods the relation of freespace
    dielectric constant and magnetic permeability constant to four
    fun amental quantities is considered other constants are also
    analysed to obtain methods of understanding the submicroscopic
    nature of electric and magnetic phenomena
