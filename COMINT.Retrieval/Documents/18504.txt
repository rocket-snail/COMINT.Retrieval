vibrating wire high q resonator resonator units are
    described in which a wire of high tensile strength is stretched
    between long pole pieces maintaining a strong transverse
    magnetic field resonance occurs when the frequency of current
    sent through the wire coincides with the natural frequency of
    the system theory is given and the equivalent electrical
    circuit analysed with a tungsten wire mounted in vacuo a q
    value of has been obtained at kcs applications of such devices
    in filters and for frequency control are noted
