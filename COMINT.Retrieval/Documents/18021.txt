on the diffraction and reflection of waves and pulses by
    wedges and corners various problems arising in the theory of
    the excitation of a perfectly reflecting wedge or corner by a
    plane cylindrical or spherical wave are dealt with the incident
    wave is represented by a line source acoustic or
    electromagnetic parallel to the edge the spherical wave is
    emitted by an acoustic point source or by a hertz dipole with
    its axis parallel to the edge the case of an incident plane
    wave field is obtained as the limiting case for large distances
    of the source from the edge of the cylindrical or spherical
    wave excitation
