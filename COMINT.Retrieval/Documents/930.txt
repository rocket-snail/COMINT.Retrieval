the f layer at sunrise observations at cambridge and
    slough show that at fixed heights in the f region just after
    layer sunrise the electron density increases faster in winter
    than in summer and faster at sunspot maximum than at sunspot
    minimum it is postulated that seasonal changes of atmospheric
    composition alter the rates of electron production and loss
    thereby causing both the noon and sunrise seasonal f layer
    anomalies
