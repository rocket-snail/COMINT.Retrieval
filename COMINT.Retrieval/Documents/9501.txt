even after 8 years within the colleges of technology,
    librarianship training is still a crisis area. although
    national guidelines were drawn up on librarianship training,
    each west german state is responsible for its own education
    system, therefore considerable variations still exist
    concerning legal status of library schools, entry requirements,
    curricula for compulsory and optional subjects and organisation
    of courses for public and academic librarians. some subjects
    are not taught at all in some schools and generally related
    subjects are split up too much. many lecturers place too much
    emphasis on formal lectures' many students are uninterested in
    their studies. training courses must develop students' critical
    faculties, encourage creativity and promote active
    communication with readers and cooperation with other
    institutions; better organisation and more unification among
    library schools are required.
