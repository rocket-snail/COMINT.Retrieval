the strength of meteoric echoes from dense columns
    calculations taking into account the refractive effects
    produced by ionization distributed at radii t radii greater
    than the critical density radius have been made for large
    highly ionized trails using geometrical optics and ray tracing
    methods the computed maximum radiated power from a diffusion
    formed trail is only of that calculated on the critical density
    radius method
