interpretation of smooth type atmospheric waveforms
    accurate waveguide or pulse reflection analysis of the regular
    type of smooth waveform reveals a subdivision termed pseudo
    regular this type can be satisfactorily explained using
    waveguide or pulse reflection theory of propagation when
    complicated source conditions are considered and the discharge
    in the lightning channel is not assumed to be effectively
    instantaneous
