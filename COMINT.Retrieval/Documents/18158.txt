pm, a system for polynomial manipulation pm is an ibm
    7094 program system for formal manipulation of polynomials in
    any number of variables, with integral coefficients
    unrestricted in size. some of the formal operations which can
    be performed by the system are sums, differences, products,
    quotients, derivatives, substitutions and greater common
    divisors. pm is based on the refco iii list processing system,
    which is described and compared with the lisp and slip systems.
    the pm subroutines for arithmetic of large integers are
    described as constituting an independently useful subsystem. pm
    is compared with the alpak system in several respects,
    including the choice of canonical forms for polynomials. a new
    algorithm for polynomial greatest common divisor calculation is
    mentioned, and exaples are included to illustrate its
