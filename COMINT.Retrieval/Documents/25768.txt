anomalous electric fields in the atmosphere the potential
    gradient in the atmosphere was found to depend to a large
    extent on the presence of clouds the formula derived which
    leads to results in good agreement with measurements expresses
    the potential gradient at any given height in terms of the
    known gradients at two other heights and the three
    heights
