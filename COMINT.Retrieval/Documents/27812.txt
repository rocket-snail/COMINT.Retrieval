phase stabilization of microwave oscillators description
    of a circuit incorporating a single stable feedback loop that
    has been used to stabilize the frequency of a type band
    klystron by locking it to a harmonic of a quartz controlled
    oscillator any phase modulation in the klystron is detected in
    a phase discriminator the resulting signal is amplified in a
    differential dc amplifier and applied to the klystron repeller
    electrode
