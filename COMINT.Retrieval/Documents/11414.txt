the spur method in the problem of the exciton the
    excitons in ionic crystals are examined the interaction of
    electrons and holes with lattice vibrations is considered it is
    shown that the change of energy at low temperatures is
    primarily determined by the weakening of the interaction of
    charged particles with the field of polarized vibrations when
    the temperature rises without increase of kinetic energy the
    effective mass of the exciton is calculated see also of
