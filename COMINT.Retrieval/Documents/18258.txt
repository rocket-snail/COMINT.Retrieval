the effect of ambipolar diffusion in the night time f
    layer the effect is examined in the light of recent low
    estimates of the density of neutral particles in the f layer
    and assuming that the rate of loss of electrons is proportional
    to the electron density with certain other simplifying
    assumptions may be expressed as a sum of functions which decay
    exponentially with time an approximately parabolic chapman
    model based on the most slowly decaying of these is discussed
    correlation is found between both and magnetic figure and the
    sunspot cycle variation of the f region temperature
