an evaluation of current collection utilization
    methodologies and findings. a recent evaluation of current
    research indicates that the use of libraries cannot be
    compared; but, the use of library collections can be compared
    if the objectives for the collections are the same. the
    reasoning behind this thesis is provided along with an
    evaluation of current collection utilisation methodologies and
    findings. a set of variables that are to be accounted for in
    comparative studies is also provided.
