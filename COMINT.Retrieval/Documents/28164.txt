transistors in video equipment the importance of the
    product current gain bandwidth is discussed a new design method
    is described which gives greater gain bandwidth factors the
    conditions for maximum signal noise ratio are determined and
    confirmed experimentally signal noise ratios aad gain bandwidth
    factors are comparable to those of valves
