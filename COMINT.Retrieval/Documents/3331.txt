electrical oscillations a physical approach to the
    phenomena phenomena occurring in oscillator circuits are
    explained in terms of modulation products for an input signal
    of given form an analysis is made of the modulation products
    introduced by the curvature of the characteristic of a
    nonlinear resistor the characteristic being represented to any
    required degree of accuracy by a polynomial the operation of a
    negative resistance oscillator including a nonlinear resistor
    is explained in terms of this analysis in general the
    oscillation frequency deviates slightly downwards from the
    resonance frequency associated with the linear part of the
    circuit forced oscillations and synchronization are considered
    a vector representation is developed for transient behaviour
    and combined oscillations for detailed mathematical discussion
