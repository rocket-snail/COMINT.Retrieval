interpretation of the variation of ionospheric absorption
    as a function of frequency errors in nondeviative absorption
    calculations are attributed to the presence in the e layer of a
    thin densely ionized e layer the expression used earlier has
    been revised results obtained using the new expression indicate
    that it allows a more detailed study of the absorption
    process
