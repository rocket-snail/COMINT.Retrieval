development of vacuum capacitors vacuum capacitors are
    particularly suitable for hf hv operation in airborne radio
    equipment an account is given of the development of two types
    one having a capacitance of within at a peak working voltage of
    the corresponding figures for the other being and electrical
    and mechanical test methods are outlined
