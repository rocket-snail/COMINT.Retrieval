equivalent network representations for solid and mercury
    delay lines an equivalent network representation is obtained
    from consideration of the piezo electric properties of the
    quartz crystal used to convert the electrical energy into
    ultrasonic energy a formula is derived for the transfer
    function of the line when mercury and fused quartz lines are
    compared on the basis of the gain bandwidth product only the
    fused quartz line is superior but other factors eg production
    of spurious signals must be taken into account when selecting a
    line for a specific application
