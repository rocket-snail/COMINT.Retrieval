catalogues, bibliographies and early printed books.
    explains the difference between a catalogue and a bibliography;
    describes briefly several locally-produced catalogues recording
    holdings of early printed books in various new zealand
    institutions, acknowledging the splendid efforts of the (often
    amateur) authors; and stresses the need for a national
    descriptive catalogue of new zealand holdings of
    incunabula.
