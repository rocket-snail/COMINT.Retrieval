the design of primary and secondary radar if amplifiers
    the features of synchronous and stagger tuned circuit
    arrangements are discussed and design procedures outlined
    practical considerations such as feedback coil design and heat
    dissipation and the design of amplifiers having logarithmic
    characteristics are also covered
