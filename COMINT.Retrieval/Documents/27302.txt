distortion of a frequency modulated wave passing through
    a mismatched quaripole analysis is based on the transfer
    coefficient of the network and a formula is derived for
    nonlinear distortion in the general case from this the
    percentage of odd and even harmonics generated and the upper
    limit of the distortion factor can be determined application of
    the formula in the case of transmission lines is
    illustrated
