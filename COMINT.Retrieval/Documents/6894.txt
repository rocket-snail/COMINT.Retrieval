an experimental study of the feasibility of substituting
    2chemical abstracts1 on-line for the printed copy in a
    medium-sized medical library. in an attempt to discover a more
    economical and effective way of providing the information in
    the printed 2chemical abstracts1, the reference staff of the
    washington university (st. louis, missouri) school of medicine
    library designed a study to examine whether the on-line version
    could be substituted for the printed. for 13 weeks, patrons
    using the printed index were offered a free computer search in
    exchange for evaluating the search. only 39.6% accepted and 62%
    of these still planned to refer to the abstracts later, which
    are only available in the printed version. the hypothesis that
    the on-line version could be substituted for the printed index
    was thus not confirmed.
