library user education (in german) .from 5-9 sept 79
    loughborough university of technology, held a conference in
    cambridge on 'library user education-are new approaches
    needed?' it was of great interest to the visitors from west
    germany as they were able to gain first hand impressions of
    problems and experiences in library user education in the usa
    and the uk. library user education has become more widespread
    for university students but needs to be standardised. it was
    felt that the academic level of library user education should
    be raised and that its achievements were not yet fully
    recognised. the form of library user education practised in
    libraries in the uk cannot be directly adopted by university
    libraries in west germany owing to different conditions in
    areas such as librarian training.
