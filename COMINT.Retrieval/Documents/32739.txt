the faraday effect in conductors and semiconductors
    analysis on classical lines is pe presented for the effect on a
    plane polarized plane em wave of an applied constant magnetic
    field in the direction of propagation a formula for the
    rotation of the plane of polarization is derived which may
    possibly be checked experimentally
