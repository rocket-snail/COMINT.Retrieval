an analysis of transient response of junction transistor
    amplifiers an exact solution of the one dimensional diffusion
    equation is obtained by the method of laplaces transform the
    short circuited output collector current is calculated for a
    step input forcing function experimental results agree with the
    theory and for ordinary conditions the physical process
    underlying transistor transistor action must be diffusion of
    minority carriers across the base region
