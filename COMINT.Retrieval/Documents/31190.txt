on the approximation problem in network synthesis a
    method of synthesis is presented in which a desired frequency
    response characteristic is replaced by an approximation
    consisting of a sequence of rectilinear segments the method is
    illustrated by application to the design of attenuation
    equalizers with constant resistance ladder sections
