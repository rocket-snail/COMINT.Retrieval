the electronic office. describes the functions and
    equipment of the forecast 'electronic office' by considering in
    fundamental terms the functions of an 'office' and the ways in
    which mature electronic information technology could be
    deployed to help people carry out such functions. concludes
    that even after the technological problems have been solved,
    the timing is likely to be determined by a commercial
    stick/slip process so that for a long time the new technology
    will have little impact upon normal modes of office work but
    when changes start occurring they will proceed further and
    faster than we would like.
