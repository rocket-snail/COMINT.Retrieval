ohms law for build up phenomena in the case of pole
    networks the laplace transformation is applied in the form of a
    fourier integral of the input waveform doetschs symbolic
    notation for asymmetrical transformations of is used and the
    equality sign of ohms law is replaced by the doetsch
    transformation sign the variation with time of a current
    through a complex impedance is given by the laplace transform
    product of the susceptance and the applied voltage spectrum
    application of the transformation in quadripole theory is
    described by formulating the quadripole equation in chain
    matrix form transient response parameters can be roughly
    estimated application of the theory to the determination of
    transient distortion in communication systems and to the
    stability testing of amplifiers is outlined
