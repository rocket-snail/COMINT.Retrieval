reducing block accesses in inverted files by partial
    clustering. the retrieval of information from an inverted file
    requires access to both index and data blocks. heuristic
    techniques to reduce the number of data block accesses are
    presented, and can be reorganised concurrently with normal user
    activities. previous work on interrelated record clustering
    techniques is described. methods for the partial reorganisation
    of data files are described and compared with the total sort
    method, using an artificial randomly generated file. methods
    described are sorting in order of the catenated key formed from
    the attibutes, reordering a set of adjacent blocks, and the
    local optimum, partial sort and care methods for selecting the
    cluster; sorting gave the best results, but is not suitable for
    on-line reorganisation. partial methods favour an increase in
    the buffer size, and the distance function is more effective
    for selecting a cluster, where the attributes have many
    values.
