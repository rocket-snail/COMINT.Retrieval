a band pass filter with active elements the design of a
    filter amplifier is described in which impedance inversion and
    loss compensation are achieved using two npn junction
    transistors type in an arrangement based on the valve circuit
    described by harris of the centre frequency of the filter is
    and the bandwidth is and at the and points respectively a
    complete unit shown includes a third transistor with grounded
    emitter connection and gives an overall gain of db
