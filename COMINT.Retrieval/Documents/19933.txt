the environment for special libraries in the 1980s.
    events and developments occurring now and in the 1980s will
    have substantial impact on libraries and their operations.
    effective planning depends on knowledge of likely events and
    trends and on the integration of these factors into the future
    operations of the library. the significant demographic,
    political, social, economic, and technological trends affecting
    libraries are reviewed. while the likely effects of these
    changes are suggested, they do not apply uniformly to all
    libraries. librarians must select the factors significant to
    their library and plan within its specific environment.
