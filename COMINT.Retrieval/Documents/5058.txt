document: 'library organisation in eretz-yisrael' (in
    hebrew). fishman studied librarianship in the usa immediately
    after world war i and it is then that he wrote this article,
    originally published in hapoel hatzair. library collections in
    eretz-yisrael are unplanned and not systematic, because they
    are based almost exclusively on gifts, rather than purchases.
    librarians must not obligate themselves to catalogue gift
    collections in toto, but must leave themselves free to choose
    only what is needed and to give away or exchange the rest. he
    calls for the foundation of a national union catalogue in
    jerusalem with far-reaching centralised powers to transfer
    books from 1 library to others where they will be more
    useful.
