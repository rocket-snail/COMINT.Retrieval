library research should be defined as broadly as
    possible. comments on a report on library research by a
    committee of the librarians' union. it wrongly contrasts
    librarians and academics as most librarians have an academic
    training, but it stresses the need for a research council
    specifically including library research in its sphere. urges
    that library research should be defineed as broadly as
    possible, and that it should have an aim wider than that of
    increasing efficiency. employers and unions should not be part
    of a library research council, as suggested in the report. the
    report rightly stresses the need for further education of
    librarians, but is wrongly against giving formal credit to such
    training in the form of a degree, fearing unnecessarily the
    creation of elite librarians.
