statistics as basis for improvement of the quality and
    efficiency of library processes. an in-depth analysis of the
    working of a library or a library system can be carried out by
    means of statistical data obtained from the whole spectrum of
    its activities. these can be divided into' activities of its
    organisational and material basis; work concerning users; work
    related to loans. the quality of work can then be determined by
    meaningful correlation of individual data within the framework
    of 1 of these groups, or between the data and indexes of 2 or 3
    groups.
