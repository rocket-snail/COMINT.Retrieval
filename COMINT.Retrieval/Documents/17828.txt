the guideline on stock expansion in general public
    libraries. in the 1976-80 guidelines on libraries in east
    germany, long-term stock planning was advocated on a basis of
    differential values for stock items per inhabitant, so that
    stocks can be acquired which allow for social demands.
    functional equipping of different types of library is necessary
    to facilitate regional purchasing scheme development. the stock
    guideline for 1981-85 emphasises stock expansion and the
    purchase of replacement copies; other guidelines cover the
    expansion of audio-visual media services, new rules on the
    purchase of periodicals and newspapers and extra provision of
    books in holiday resorts. the latest guidelines should remove
    unjustifiable differences in stock standards.
