the work of the information specialist. paper presented
    to the meeting of the centrum voor literatuuronderzoekers
    (centre for information specialists), amsterdam, 15 oct 80. the
    trend towards decentralisation of administrative and technical
    support services in industrial organisations and the increasing
    use of automation in libraries will have a profound effect on
    the work of the information specialist. the professional
    organisations concerned with librarianship and information
    science must publicise the work of their members more
    effectively in the centres of higher education and at
    industrial management training courses. the information
    specialist must convince the management of his organisation
    that automation will not enable duties normally performed in
    the library to be taken over by technical staff. the
    information specialist must also be allowed to participate in
    the policy planning of his organisation.
