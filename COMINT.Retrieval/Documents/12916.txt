energy conversion mechanism in a bounded magnetized
    current carrying plasma for a finite plasma coupling exists
    between quasi transverse em waves and quasi longitudinal space
    charge waves this can lead to an energy transfer between the
    kinetic energy of drifting plasma and em energy this mechanism
    may be useful for heating a thermonuclear plasma using the
    runaway electrons certain types of clf radio noise can als be
    explained
