effectiveness of two step smoothing in digital control
    computers the use of a digital computer as an element in a
    control system to smooth observational data is discussed
    analysis is presented for a two stage system in which the first
    stage has a high data handling rate and short smoothing time
    while the second has a low data handling rate and a long
    smoothing time
