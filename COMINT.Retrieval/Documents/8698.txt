the location and shape of the auroral zone observed
    characteristics of aurorae and examination of data for the
    polar year support the view that an electrically neutral
    particle stream coming from the sun is resolved into positive
    and negative components on encountering the earths magnetic
    field the two components following opposing spiral tracks into
    the auroral zone
