ulrich's references to microform availability. attempting
    to use ulrich's international periodicals directory as a guide
    to the availability of microform of many journals can be
    misleading. a quick survey of 25 titles listed in the guide to
    microforms in print shows that ulrich's listed availability for
    only 30.76%. the survey also brought out that some outstanding
    us government titles are not listed in ulrich's.
