nonadiabatic behaviour in a low frequency beam type maser
    characteristics are discussed theoretically when the adiabatic
    focusing approximation travelling wave maser using chromium
    doped rutile the active material is of small cross section and
    is connected to standard size x band waveguides by dielectric
    tapers performance figures quoted show appreciable gain per
    unit length with a very large tunable bandwidth obtained
    without the use of any external sh slowing structure
