the brownless av centre' the first year of operation.
    this evaluative study reports on the 1st year of operation of
    the audiovisual resources centre in the brownless medical
    library of the university of melbourne. during a representative
    week in each of 3 terms in 1978, every user of the centre was
    requested to complete a comprehensive questionnaire. in
    addition, a staff questionnaire was mailed to all medical and
    biological staff of the university. the nature and extent of
    use of the centre were explored in depth, as well as the
    relevance and adequacy of the programme with respect to both
    the needs and expectations of staff and students. the report
    analyses the developments to date and indicates ways in which
    the facility can become an even more effective learning
    resource in the future. report not available from ntis.
