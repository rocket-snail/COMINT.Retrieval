    managers. stresses the importance of information as an economic
    product and emphasises its vital role in society. since the
    value of information to society is increasing, its management
    should be strengthened-this is a challenge to information
    managers, particularly in balancing reduction of resource
    investments and increases in the value of information assets.
    an analysis of the information cycle in this respect is given
    and a plea is made for information managers to contribute
    significantly to the development of the future office.
