raising the cut off frequency of transistors the cut off
    frequency of transistor operation is raised by neutralizing the
    collector capacitance by means of inductance connected between
    collector and emitter calculations of the bandwidth between the
    points on both sides of the resonant frequency are made for
    grounded base grounded emitter and grounded collector
