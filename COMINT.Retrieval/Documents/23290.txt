a low frequency random signal generator the and noise
    components each in an overall bandwidth of are selected from
    the noise output of an argon filled thyratron operating in a
    magnetic field after peak rectification the resulting noise
    signals are added so that their dc components cancel the
    amplitude distribution of the resultant output then
    approximates very closely to a gaussian distribution the output
    noise spectrum is flat from zero frequency up to a full circuit
    diagram is given
