optic axes and critical coupling in the ionosphere the
    similarity between the phenomena of double refraction in
    crystals and in the ionosphere is discussed the ionosphere
    problem is studied by introducing a reference system based on
    the principal directions of the three dimensional dielectric
    ellipsoid these depend only on the direction of the earths
    field and are essentially constant over the ionosphere optic
    axes can exist in the ionosphere in the presence of collisions
    and this is precisely the condition for critical coupling
    between the ordinary and extraordinary modes the analysis is
    illustrated by reference to a possible set of ionospheric
    conditions
