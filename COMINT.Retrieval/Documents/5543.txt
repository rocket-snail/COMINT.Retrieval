automated circulation systems vis-a-vis automated
    cataloguing. an automated circulation system should not be
    developed without due regard to an existing automated
    cataloguing system. above all, there should be the facility for
    data exchange, to produce machine-readable book labels, and to
    establish the necessary files without duplication of data.
    there are problems, however, as catalogue and lending are based
    upon title-entry and book as physical unit respectively, and
    further, the complex structure of title-entry and call number.
    various functions of the system make it necessary to connect
    different book units according to title entry. a short title is
    necessary for overdue notices. discusses problems resulting
    from cataloguing with an off-line system, whilst using an
    on-line circulation system.
