construction and calibration of a very high frequency
    transformer a matching device for insertion in a coaxial line
    consists of a pair of rings which can be slid independently
    along the line between the inner and outer conductors without
    touching either of them the frequency range for the type
    described is theory is developed on the basis of the
    equivalence of the device to a cascade connection of two loss
