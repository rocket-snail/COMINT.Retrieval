theory of triode oscillators with coaxial resonators a
    study of disk seal triode oscillators the conditions necessary
    for maintaining oscillations are derived the width of the
    frequency range with a fixed tuned grid circuit is calculated
    from the valve parameters deviations from the theoretical value
    encountered under working conditions are discussed a general
    criterion for mode separation is established
