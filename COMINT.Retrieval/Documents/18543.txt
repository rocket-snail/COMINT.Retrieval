the urquhart building of the british library lending
    division' the design of a single function library building. a
    staged building programme has been necessary to meet the growth
    in demand on the blld and to house its increased stock. the
    urquhart building, the site's main building, is designed for
    easy access to high-use stock, fast flow of material, and
    future flexibility. the ground floor receives and despatches
    post, and mechanical handling equipment moves request forms and
    library materials to the processing and records area on the 1st
    floor and the 6 further storeys that house stock. there are
    large areas for access and machinery on the storage floors. the
    shelving for both hard-copy and microforms was specially
    designed. mechanical handling systems include conveyors in the
    packing areas, automatic vertical elevators, and mobile
    containers to carry request forms between request processing
    and storage areas. other buildings on the site will be used for
    future stock expansion.
