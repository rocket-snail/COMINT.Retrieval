geographic and temporal distribution of polar blackouts
    tabulations of hourly values of the ionospheric parameters for
    northern hemisphere stations have been used to derive diurnal
    variations in the occurrence of blackout no echo conditions
    contour plots are presented showing the diurnal average
    percentage of time during which blackout conditions prevailed
    the amplitude of the diurnal variation and the time of maximum
    frequency of occurrence changes in the contours with season and
    with magnetic activity are discussed
