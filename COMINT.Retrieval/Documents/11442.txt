measurement of microwave diffraction from a long slit in
    a thin conducting plane an outline is given f of technique used
    to produce a uniform incident plane wave results of
    measurements of the intensity of the diffraction field are
    shown graphically for longitudinal and transverse polarization
    of the incident wave
