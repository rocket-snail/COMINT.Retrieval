generalization to nonlinear net works of a theorem due to
    heaviside a theorem enunciated by heaviside and proved by
    lorentz for linear electromagnetic systems subjected to a
    suddenly impressed constant electric force is extended to
    electrical net works comprising nonlinear reactances and linear
    resistance
