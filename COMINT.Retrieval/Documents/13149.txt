the new pla planning process. explanation of why the new
    us public library association planning process exists, why work
    has been carried out on it, what the old standards mean, and
    the considerations for new standards in the future. the new
    process views the existing service programme, establishes
    priorities, and considers modifications and alternatives within
    the programme. when all local services are competing for the
    same limited monies, the public library must use the planning
    process to gain public support.
