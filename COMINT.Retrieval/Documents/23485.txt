study of recreational reading in the first grade
    municipal schools in belo horizonte, brazil. report based on a
    postgraduate thesis, presented at ufmg library school, brazil.
    the reading habits of a 5% sample of pupils were investigated
    by questionnaire, and supplementary information obtained from
    teachers and school librarians. results showed that reading is
    not a popular leisure activity, and that neither teachers nor
    librarians are as active as they might be in stimulating
    interest in reading. the necessity for further more detailed
    studies is emphasised.
