optimal opening hours in public libraries. despite recent
    increases in stocks and readership, public libraries must
    attain even higher standards of achievement. public libraries
    are used by only a small proportion of industrial and
    agricultural workers, apprentices and schoolchildren; one way
    to encourage more of them to use libraries could be to make
    opening hours longer and more convenient for them, especially
    in the evening. libraries could reserve the mornings and early
    afternoons for administrative and processing work and then open
    to the public at least till 6 p.m., depending on local
    conditions. all departments for public use should be open
    simultaneously and staff training must be developed so that
    expert assistance is always available to the public.
