translation and arabization of the anglo american
    cataloguing rules (in arabic). the jordan library association,
    with the support of the arab league educational, cultural, and
    scientific organization (alecso), has begun the translation and
    arabization of aacr 2 which it is hoped will be finished in mid
    1982. this will be a step towards the standardisation of
    cataloguing, classification and subject headings, the
    importance of which has been emphasised by many library
    conferences in arabic countries since 1959. the translated
    edition will include arabic examples, suitable for the arab
    world, in addition to recommendations for dealing with problems
    and issues that arab cataloguers and bibliographers
    face.
