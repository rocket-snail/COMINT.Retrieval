ala' cla ties that bind, but don't chafe. contribution to
    an issue devoted to papers presented at the canadian library
    association annual conference, june 81. examines the
    relationship between the american library association and the
    canadian library association, and places it in its historical
    perspective. notes the unparalleled growth of american and
    canadian libraries in the 1960s, and identifies the challenges
    which they face in the 1980s. libraries in both countries are
    seen as having to deal with the problems caused by increased
    costs for labour and library materials, coupled with an all
    over decline in funding, and competition from new information
    agencies, from supermarkets and other outlets for commercial
    reading, and from viewing and listening materials. discusses
    the link between us and canadian library education, and
    indicates the possible need for a change in this
    relationship.
