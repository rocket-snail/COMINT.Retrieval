resistance capacitance networks with over unity gain
    longmire of and epstein of have described rc circuits with
    greater output than input voltage a method of increasing the
    voltage gain by feeding the output voltage of one network into
    a second network is described the process cannot be extended
    indefinitely the voltage gain attainable being limited by the
    impedance increase necessary at each stage experiments
    confirmed the theory such networks can be used with a cathode
    follower to construct oscillators in which the valve gain is
    less than unity an experimental circuit is described
