power amplification bandwidth figure of merit for
    transducers including transistors a figure of merit based on
    spot frequency maximum power amplification bandwidth is derived
    for a transducer which is unilateralized and conjugately
    matched the result being simplified by assuming a bell shaped
    frequency response specific formulae are given for valve and
    transistor circuits see eg of
