technology and the information professional: will it make
    a difference?. examines the likely impact of new technology on
    librarians and information scientists, and on data base
    producers, over the next 10 years. data base producers will
    increasingly rely on home-based abstractors who receive, create
    and send all their material by electronic means. the advantages
    of such procedures for the data base producers are outlined.
    increasing use of videodiscs for information storage and
    retrieval is envisaged. the impact of new technology on
    librarians and information scientists is then examined. use of
    videodiscs will mean a decline in the use of on-line
    information retrieval. use of intelligent terminals will lead
    to greater use of these systems by end-users. the intelligent
    terminals could be used to translate software languages, to
    refine search strategies, to store and edit output from
    searches and to advise users on the best data bases and best
    search strategy to use. all these developments will be
    integrated into those leading to the 'office of the future'.
    concludes that there will be a dramatic shakeout in
    librarianship, but that information scientists face a great
    opportunity to develop their skills by the opportunities
    afforded by the new technology. it is recommended that schools
    of information science teach their students typing skills.
    finally, some remarks about the advisability of offering
    sophisticated information retrieval systems to less developed
    countries are made.
