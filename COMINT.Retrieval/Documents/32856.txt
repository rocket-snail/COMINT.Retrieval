wide band transformer characteristics a parameter is
    defined for wide band transformers which represents the series
    resonance of the leakage inductance and the primary and
    secondary stray capacitances it is shown that this parameter
    may be determined from the low frequency requirements on the
    transformer and then used as a guide to the attainable high
    frequency response
