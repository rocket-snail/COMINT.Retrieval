nonlinear theory of plasma oscillations and waves an
    exact differential equation for density oscillations is found
    considering only coulomb interactions between electrons a
    number of properties of plasma oscillations are then derived
    including the form of stationary spherical waves in an
    isotropic plasma see also of
