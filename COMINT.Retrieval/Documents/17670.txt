the underlying characteristics of the bradford
    distribution. the bradford distribution differs from most
    probability distributions in that it is concerned with the
    rank-order s of the elements in terms of their productivity
    (from highest down to lowest) rather than with the numerical
    values n of the element's productivity. the defining
    relationship is that s is exponentially related to g, the
    cumulative production of the elements of rank-order s or less.
    this implies a zipf-like relationship between mean productivity
    and rank-order, which is analogous to the weber-fechner law of
    psychophysics. a variational specification of the distribution
    is given, and it is pointed out that the relationship between
    the construction of the bradford and that of the usual
    distributions is roughly analogous to the relationship between
    lebesgue and riemann integration.
