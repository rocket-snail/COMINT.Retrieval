recent advances in cathode ray tube storage modifications
    have been made to the system described by williams and kilburn
    of and used in the manchester university computer the defocus
    focus system and the signal amplifier are discussed
    particularly an account is given of experimental work
    undertaken to clarify the storage mechanism the theoretical
    basis of the system is examined the original theory through
    inaccurate in detail is satisfactory for practical purposes and
    can be used to predict storage results the tube operation is
    analogous to that of a triode valve the collector bombarded
    spot and surroudning screen surface corresponding respectively
    to the anode cathode and control grid
