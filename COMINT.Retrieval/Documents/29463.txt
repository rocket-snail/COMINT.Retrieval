research strategies' bibliographic instruction for
    undergraduates. contribution to a thematic issue on library use
    instruction. examines theory and practice concerned with the
    nature of education in research strategies-or search
    strategies, the more commonly used designation. recognises the
    disagreement amongst professionals about the precise meaning of
    these terms, and discusses the following aspects of
    undergraduate education in research strategies' the level of
    student to be taught; the content of instruction; the methods
    used to teach; and who should teach. uses examples from the
    social sciences to illustrate some of the points made in these
    discussions. concludes that the successful education of
    undergraduates in research strategies hinges primarily on the
    decision about what is to be taught, and that the other
    questions, although not unimportant, are at present, of
    secondary concern.
