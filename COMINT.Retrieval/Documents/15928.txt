according to the general plan (bibliographical work of
    the rnskhbinform of the kirgiz ssr). the provision of
    agricultural information services in kirgizia has greatly
    improved with the foundation, in 1975, of the respublikanskaya
    nauchnaya selskokhozyaistvennaya biblioteka (agricultural
    library of the republic), its designation as the centre of
    agricultural information services, and the establishment of the
    centralised network of agricultural libraries. these factors
    provided a framework for the provision of centrally planned,
    organised and coordinated bibliographical information
    comprising' reference information services, provision of
    current bibliographical information to agricultural
    specialists, answering of individual enquiries, compilation of
    current and retrospective subject bibliographies, and the
    promotion of bibliographical materials. the use of the central
    library's stock by specialists in remote rural areas is made
    possible through an interlibrary lending service run by the net
    work.
