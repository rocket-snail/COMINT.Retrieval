hydromagnetics and the earths inner core it is suggested
    that the terrestrial magnetic field is produced in an inner
    liquid core permeated by a magnetic field of secondary motions
    partly hydromagnetic occur in an outer surrounding liquid
    region and the field emerging from the complete core is the
    small field measured at the earths surface
