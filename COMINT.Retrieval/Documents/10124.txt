the production stimulating factory library in west
    germany. despite development of public libraries in west
    germany, private workplace libraries remain important. there
    are 250 of these with 1 1/2 million volumes serving 800,000
    employees. an investigation in 1974 by konjetzky and ploetz
    revealed an illiberal bias in book selection. the factory
    librarians' organisation justifies the library by its
    usefulness to the firm and refers to an article by muth (the
    reader as a factor of productivity in the firm), in which he
    argues that the aim of the library is to develop and maintain
    the ability to read, as efficient readers mean workers with
    high mobility, and money spent on libraries is likely to yield
    a high return.
