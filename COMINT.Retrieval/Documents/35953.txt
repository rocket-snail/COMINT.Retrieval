dynamics of corona discharge between cylindrical
    electrodes the screening action of the space action of the
    space charge is responsible for the constancy and stability of
    the average discharge current fluctuations are explained as a
    response of the system having a definite resonance frequency to
    the statistical fluctuations of the photoelectric current
    theoretical predictions are confirmed by experiment
