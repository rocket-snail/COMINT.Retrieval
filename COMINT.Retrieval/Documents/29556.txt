the computing information service network in bell
    laboratories. the computing information service (cis), a
    network of 5 specialised libraries devoted entirely to
    computing information, operates in concert with the bell
    laboratories library network in providing services to some
    22,000 employees. the cis is dedicated entirely to computing
    information in all its forms - computer programs, related
    documentation, machine manuals, audio/video tapes, books,
    journals, etc. a full range of current awareness, searching,
    reference, dissemination, and advisory services is provided
    using a number of computer-aided systems. the network approach
    for managing computing information services has yielded
    dividends and has been integrated harmoniously with the
    extensive resources of the 18 other libraries in the bell labs
    library network.
