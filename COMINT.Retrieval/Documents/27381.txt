the german national library: purchase of new building
    site. the latest annual report confirms the purchase of a site
    of 19,000 sq.m. for the new building required to ease the space
    shortage. the data processing plant has been enlarged and
    improved and is now linked with euronet diane. there was a
    record total stock growth of 13.8%. main stock increases
    occurred for maps, literature by german authors exiled in the
    1930's, dissertations, music scores and microform publications.
    the library's cataloguing rules have been adapted to the rak
    (german alphabetical cataloguing rules) for academic libraries;
    production of the deutsche bibliographie (german national
    bibliography) has shown wider coverage and improvement in
    procedures. over 139,000 requests for material were made by
    about 10,000 readers. the library organised several exhibitions
    and was involved in cooperative activities with other libraries
    at home and abroad.
