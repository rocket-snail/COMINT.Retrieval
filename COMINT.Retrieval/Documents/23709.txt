rules of similitude for magnetic amplifier systems rules
    are established which enable the properties of magnetic
    amplifier systems to be deduced from the results of suitable
    tests on a model the amplifier or analogue computer the method
    covers cases in which model and prototype have different core
    materials and different circuits
