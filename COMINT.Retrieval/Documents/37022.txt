the computerised library as a working milieu. no danish
    library is yet fully computerised, though individual projects
    are in operation. specialised education, especially in-service
    courses, is necessary, but librarians' complaints about
    computerisation may stem from several physical and
    psychological factors not yet fully explored. staff may feel
    ruled by the machine unless encouraged to understand the system
    thoroughly and take part in organising work processes. in
    setting up samkat at the danish national library, cataloguers
    have been fully involved in the 1st (cataloguing) stage, and
    will take part in future development of the system to ensure
    consistency. when staff feel at ease with the computer, its
    advantages include making their work less strenuous but more
    stimulating (provided good-quality print-outs are attained) and
    improving inter-library cooperation and service to readers.
    librarians should remain responsible for their working
    conditions, and introduce technological developme nts at a
    suitable tempo.
