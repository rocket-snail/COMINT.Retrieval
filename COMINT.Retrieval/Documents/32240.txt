effect of electron ion collisions in the f region of the
    ionosphere on the absorption of cosmic radio noise at ahmedabad
    changes in absorption associated with magnetic storms riometer
    measurements at a frequency of have been compared with
    calculated values of total nondeviative absorption due to
    collisions with neutral particles with ions which occurred
    below maximum and the differences ascribed to absorption
    occurring baove the layer maximum the results show a depletion
    of electrons above the f maximum on the day following a sudden
    commencement and are compared with satellite observations on
    particle fluxes in van allen belts during storms
