electron temperature and electron noise in high frequency
    torch discharges the noise temperature of an electron torch in
    air and nitrogen at atmospheric pressure is measured at and
    found to be of which about is due to electron temperature and
    to shot noise these results and the measurements of other
    plasma characteristics are interpreted with reference to the
    findings of other authors references
