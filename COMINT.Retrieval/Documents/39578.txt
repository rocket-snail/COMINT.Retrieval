generalized mobility theory a formal theory of mobility
    is presented that does not depend on the existence of a
    transport equation in particular the hamiltonian describing the
    electron plus the scattering system is not decomposed into an
    unperturbed part plus a perturbation only the applied field is
    treated as small the result is shown to reduce to the usual
    transport result when the scattering perturbation is weak
    without assuming the existence of a relaxation time the
    relation between a many electron treatment and the one electron
    treatment is demonstrated for the case of fermi as well as
    boltzmann statistics
