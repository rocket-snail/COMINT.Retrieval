comparison of hierarchical cluster analysis techniques
    for automatic classification of chemical structures. several
    hierarchical cluster analysis methods were applied to a set of
    benzenoid compounds by using structural features automatically
    derived from wiswesser line notation. comparions of the
    differences in classification, due to choice of clustering
    algorithm and data standardisation technique, were made.
