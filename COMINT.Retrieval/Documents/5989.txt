extensions of the chapman theory of layer formation an
    attempt has been made to establish some of the theorems
    necessary for the extension of the chapman theory of layer
    formation to the case where a spectrum of ionizing radiation
    acts on an atmosphere with any temperature profile some
    invariant properties of the electron production function have
    been established and they have proved useful in estimating the
    temperature and temperature variations in the ionosphere
