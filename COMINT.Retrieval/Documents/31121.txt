on the magnetic time dependence of the auroral zone
    currents the geomagnetic time for the evening passage of the
    geomagnetic component h through the zero disturbance level was
    measured at kiruna and college on days a time difference of min
    was found only part of which can be explained by means of
    higher spherical harmonic terms of the geomagnetic field
