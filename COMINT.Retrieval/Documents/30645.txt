the diffraction of electromagnetic waves at a grating
    consisting of parallel conducting strips a rigorous solution is
    given for diffraction of a normally incident plane wave the
    width of the strips being equal to the spaces between them
    graphs show the reflection and transmission of the wave for
    various ratios of strip width to wavelength and the amplitudes
    of the diffraction spectra
