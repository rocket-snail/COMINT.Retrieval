oscillations of a cylindrical cavity in a completely
    ionized plasma investigation of the oscillations of a
    cylindrical cavity in a perfectly conducting plasma with
    applied magnetic field the system is shown to be stable and
    under certain conditions waves cannot propagate along the
    cavity
