german research association library committee. at its
    spring meeting the committee made recommendations concerning
    the development of the central agricultural library in bonn
    over the 2-year period 1982-84, to bring it up to the standard
    of other faculty libraries now that suitable premises are under
    construction. in berlin a periodical data bank will link the
    federal states and will include holdings of the main university
    libraries and the federal bureau of statistics. there has been
    no progress in setting up an information system for the arts.
    it was decided to publish a catalogue of historical material at
    gottingen and to put on film the central catalogue for north
    rhineland/westphalia.
