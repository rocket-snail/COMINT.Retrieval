the influence of domain structure on the magnetization
    curves of single crystals neels model for the domain structure
    of a single crystal of iron in the form of a strip parallel to
    the direction was used in the calculation of magnetization
    curves depend explicitly on the width of the crystal comparison
    between the calculated curve and experimental results for a si
    fe crystal shows good agreement particularly at low field
