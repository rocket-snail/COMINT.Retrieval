giving birth to a journal. article adapted from a paper
    presented at the 5th annual spring conference of the
    librarians' association at the university of north carolina at
    chapel hill, mar 81. makes general points about starting up a
    new journal, based on the experiences of a specific
    publication. a perceived need led to the birth of a
    publication, attended by complications-some expected, others
    not-but resulting in an increasingly healthy journal that
    disseminates data and ideas.
