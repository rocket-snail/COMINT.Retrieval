user education in secondary school libraries. the school
    librarian should take the initiative in the teaching of
    information and research skills to pupils without subject bias.
    getting to know pupils is important so that the appropriate
    service can be offered. regular library visits for 1st-year
    pupils are especially valuable and are best done by timetabling
    a library lesson that is not attached to a particular subject
    area. thereafter visits can be organised as required but the
    need for a more structured approach is often felt by the start
    of the 4th year. it is important too that the teaching staff
    have research and information skills and these can be developed
    by the librarian.
