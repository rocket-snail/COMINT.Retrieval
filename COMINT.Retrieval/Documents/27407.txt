the uniform system of home health agency reporting' an
    analysis of its impact on home health care providers. the
    purpose of this study was to estimate the costs to implement
    and maintain the uniform system for home health agency
    reporting (ushhar). this study will provide information needed
    to revise the draft ushhar and the data necessary for
    calculating the reporting burden when the system is ultimately
    revised. the identification of the areas of burden will be
    useful in reducing the scope of the reporting system, by
    identifying where incompatibilities exist.
