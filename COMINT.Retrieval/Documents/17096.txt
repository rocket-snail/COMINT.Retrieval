home videotex services' some legal issues. revised
    version of paper presented at a conference, new developments in
    canadian communications law and policy, ottawa, jan 80. the
    provision of videotex services raises interesting legal issues.
    the existing framework of regulations applicable to radio,
    television, and telecommunications will likely apply to
    videotex, although different transmission mechanisms may well
    be regulated differently. it is uncertain if the copyright law
    in canada covers information stored in computers such as that
    which would be contained in a videotex system. videotex
    services originating outside canada would be able to sidestep
    canadian priorities and canadian legislative requirements. it
    has been suggested that a way of dealing with the problem would
    be to regulate the flow of data across national borders.
