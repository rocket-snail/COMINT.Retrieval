a nonlinear statistical filter a method is described for
    using the statistical differences between a periodic
    rectangular pulse the wanted signal and the envelope of
    fluctuation noise the interfering signal for the purpose of
    discriminating between the two signals expressions are derived
    for the density distribution probability of noise and of signal
    plus noise a description is given of a practical filter which
    was checked experimentally under conditions when the signal was
    completely masked by the noise both aurally and visually but
    could be reliably detected by means of the statistical filter
    possible application to secret transmission systems is
    discussed
