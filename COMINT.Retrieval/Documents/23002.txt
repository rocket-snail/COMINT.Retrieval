marks of insufficiency: lessons of a meeting and of a
    thematic issue of a journal. the professional meeting held in
    autumn 81 in kecskemet and the thematic issue of the periodical
    informacio/elektronika (16 (5) 1981) dealing with library
    mechanisation have raised a number of questions concerning
    hungarian information and documentation. the problems result
    from changes in the description of documents and from the
    drawing up of catalogues following from them. on the basis of
    their examination, points to the facts hindering development'
    foreign results of automation are taken over with difficulty;
    library mechanisation is uncoordinated; the theory of
    classification is undeveloped and terminology is not
    clear.
