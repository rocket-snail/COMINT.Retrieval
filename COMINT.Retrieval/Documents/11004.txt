tunable temperature compensated reference cavity a design
    is discussed based on separation of the tuning and temperature
    compensation functions temperature compensation at fixed
    frequency is discussed first and the conditions for variable
    frequency are then deduced experiments indicate that a cavity
    with a double nosed construction can be made satisfying the
    theoretical requirements over a or band analysis is presented
    with reference to an equivalent circuit
