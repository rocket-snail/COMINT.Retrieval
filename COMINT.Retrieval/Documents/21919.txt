the synthesis of a network to have a sine squared impulse
    response the method of moments of the mean moment type used by
    moss is applied to the problem of designing a network with an
    impulse response of prescribed form the method is not
    applicable in all cases but is particularly suitable for the
    design of a low pass system with not too sharp a cut off and
    not too oscillatory an impulse response calculation for the
    case of the sine squared pulse results in design data for a
    ladder network of inductors and capacitors with resistive
    terminations the discrepancy between the impulse response curve
    and the exact sine square curve at no point exceeds of the peak
    amplitude of the pulse
