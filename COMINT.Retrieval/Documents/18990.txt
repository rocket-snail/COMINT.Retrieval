on the magnetic clouds responsible for variations of
    cosmic ray and geomagnetic field discussion of the mechanism
    suggested by morrison by which large ionized gas clouds
    carrying tangled magnetic fields are emitted from the sun and
    modulate the galactic cosmic rays reaching the earth it is
    shown to be more probable that smaller magnetic clouds are
    intermittently ejected from the sun and slowed down by the
    interplanetary gas the velocity of accompanying unmagnetized
    streams is unaffected and the different velocities account for
    the observed initial and main phases of terrestrial magnetic
    storms the model also explains some solar cosmic ray
    phenomena
