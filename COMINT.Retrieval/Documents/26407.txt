radiation from fast particles moving through magnetic
    materials under certain conditions of frequency and angle of
    observation ringing of the spin system occurs differences from
    the normal cherenkov effect are discussed also the possibility
    of using the effect as a neutral magnetic moment detector or as
    a probe of magnetic materials
