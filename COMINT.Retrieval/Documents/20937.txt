magnetic systems associated with systems of permanent
    electric currents and their application to the numerical
    calculation of fields by superposing magnetic shells associated
    with the elementary tubes corresponding to arbitrary
    distribution of currents the associated magnetic systems are
    simply determined in this way a scalar potential inside the
    currents can be defined
