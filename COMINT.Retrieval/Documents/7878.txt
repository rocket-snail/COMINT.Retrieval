a condition on uniform field breakdown in electron
    attaching gases the form of the curve relating t to at
    breakdown where e is the field strength p the pressure and d
    the electrode separation indicates the existence for high
    values of pd of a value of ep below which breakdown does not
    occur a study of the equation for steady state current in
    electron attaching gases suggests that this limiting value is
    nearly that for which the ionization and attachment
    coefficients are equal this is confirmed experimentally
