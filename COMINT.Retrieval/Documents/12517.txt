some features of the transverse propagation of high
    frequency waves in a magneto active plasma mathematical
    analysis based on the kinetic equations of nonrelativistic
    theory for a simple case of transverse wave propagation in a
    uniform plasma located in a constant magnetic field the effect
    of electron collisions with other particles is neglected
