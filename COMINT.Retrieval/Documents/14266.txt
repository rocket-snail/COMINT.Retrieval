problems associated with the use of compound words in
    thesauri, with special reference to bs 5723' 1979. although
    many large systems have by-passed the problem by using natural
    language, compound words remain a difficulty in thesaurus
    construction. former attemts to devise rules which attempt to
    approach the problem via syntax were not altogether
    satisfactory. proposes that the major criteria for handling
    compound words should rest upon their orthography, lexicography
    and semantics, with special attention to the possible
    occurrence of homographs (words of a common form but different
    meanings). suggestions contained in british standard
    5723-2guidelines for the establishment and development of
    monolingual thesauri1-are assessed in relation to these
    criteria. the standard is criticised for its insufficient
    attention to mechanised systems' requirements and partial
    failure in not recording the divergent needs of pre- and
    post-coordinate systems.
