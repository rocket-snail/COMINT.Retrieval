need for primary periodicals as determined by sdi. an
    investigation of primary periodicals that appeared in
    references selected from chemical abstracts condensates was
    carried out on the output for about 2,000 profiles. frequency
    lists, in alphabetical and rank order, were created for the
    data obtained in the course of routine processing of 2 volumes:
    86 and 89. in both issues, a relatively small number of
    journals, for example, 212 and 220 out of 6,209 and 7,039
    titles, respectively, supplied 50% of the relevant papers for
    sdi users. the method is described, and the results are
    compared with the cassi list of journals most frequently cited
    in chemical abstracts.
