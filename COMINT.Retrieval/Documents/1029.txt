performance testing of a book and its index as an
    information retrieval system. the retrieval performance of book
    indexes can be measured in terms of their ability to direct a
    user selectively to text material whose identity but not
    location is known. the method requires human searchers to base
    their searching strategies on actual passages from the book
    rather than on test queries, natural or contrived. it
    circumvents the need for relevance judgment, but still yields
    performance indicators that correspond approximately to the
    recall and precision ratios of large document retrieval system
    evaluation.
