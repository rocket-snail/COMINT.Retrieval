transient response in fm the fm response to the unit
    impulse and the unit step function is calculated for a network
    whose transfer function is known a meaning is assigned to the
    associated fourier integrals which diverge in the riemann sense
    the methos is generalized to any input function which vanishes
    for negative as an illustration of the method the impulse and
    the step fm responses of a single tuned circuit are
    calculated
