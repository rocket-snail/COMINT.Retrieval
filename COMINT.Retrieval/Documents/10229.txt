the noise power bandwidths of iterated low pass rc
    filters the noise power bandwidths of n section low pass rc
    filters are calculated exactly from the transfer function for n
    to an asymptotic expression is derived for the band width when
    the number of sections is large and then the bandwidth is
    inversely proportional to n
