    review of the literature. outlines the various disciplines in
    19 european countries and in 5 international organisations or
    services which are considered to belong to the social sciences.
    the term social science is used in the more restricted sense
    and does not include the humanities. describes the general
    characteristics of social science information, its sources, the
    flow of information, information retrieval and the use of
    social science information. the information seeking behaviour
    of social science researchers is compared with that of
    researchers in science and the humanities, and also between
    researchers in various social science disciplines. the
    information requirements of social science researchers are
    differentiated from those of both social scientists in a
    non-research environment and non-social scientists who could
    make use of social science information.
