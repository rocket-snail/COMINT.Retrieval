the design of zig zag filters formulae are derived for
    the computation of a filter with a known distribution of cut
    off and peak attenuation frequencies and given image impedances
    the matching conditions between the sections and the method of
    determining the order of sections in a ladder network by means
    of a zig zag diagram is explr design is given
