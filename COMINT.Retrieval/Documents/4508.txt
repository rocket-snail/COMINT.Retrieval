electromagnetic and acoustical scattering from a semi
    infinite cone calculations of scattering cross section for em
    waves incident along the axis of the cone are made by the
    physical optics method based on current distribution and by the
    f exact method based on the appropriate field equations the
    solutions are practically identical for cone semi angles close
    to zero or the corresponding comparison is also made for
    acoustic waves
