interferometer using two aerials with variable spacing at
    the nancay radio astronomy station radiation it received by two
    parabolic reflectors which can be moved along a track a signal
    from a common lacal oscillator is transmitted by coaxial cables
    to the aerial sites multiplied and mixed with the received
    signals resulting signals are conveyed via the same caeles to a
    correlator detector results obtained with the apparatus are
    shown
