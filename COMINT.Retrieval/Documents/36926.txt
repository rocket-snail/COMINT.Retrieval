library work at factories in slovakia. trades unions
    provide libraries for factory staff, about 10% of which are run
    by full or part-time staff and the remainder by volunteers.
    these libraries are separate from the industrial technical
    libraries which concentrate on scientific, technical and
    economic material. trades union libraries began at the end of
    the 19th century and in 1948 a unified plan for their
    organisation and modernisation was brought in. their work is
    coordinated by the central trades union library in bratislava
    and close cooperation with public libraries is maintained. more
    unified standards and procedures are required for library
    techniques. the libraries' cultural and educational importance
    must be publicised and more money provided. stocks must be
    modernised and more scientific and technical material included,
    especially in places where there is no technical
    library.
