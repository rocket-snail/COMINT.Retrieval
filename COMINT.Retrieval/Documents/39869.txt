radio emission from novae and supernovae attempts have
    been made to observe the radio emission at from two supernovae
    and ten novae keplers star was the only reasonably certain
    identification a comparison with radio observations of other
    supernova remnants suggests a constant ratio between the
    present radio emission and the maximum emission of light it is
    concluded that for common novae which are not detectable as
    radio sources this ratio must be smaller than for supernovae
    the galactic radio emission near the plane of the milky way
    could be largely the integrated emission of supernova remnants
    but common novae could not contribute appreciably
