user education-for life?. user education programmes fall
    into 2 categories. they may aim simply to help the student
    through his course and familiarise him with a single library
    (short-term objectives), or to provide a fuller awareness of
    the generation, role, and use of information which may allow
    him to research problems in any subsequent professional
    situation (long-term objectives). argues that the latter are
    more valuable; the objectives of librarian and student on such
    courses are discussed in detail. a user education course based
    on long-term objectives is described, and its effects on
    student and library discussed. finally, the contribution of
    user education to the 'information society' is considered, and
    user education programmes with long-term objectives
    preferred.
