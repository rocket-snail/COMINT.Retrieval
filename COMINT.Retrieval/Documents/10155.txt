brookes and bibliometry' with st. matthew and robin hood
    in finland. discusses bibliometry and its uses, in connection
    with a course held in finland, in oct 81. bibliometry is a
    mathematical aid for analysing library problems. unlike
    traditional library statistics, which use groups, bibliometry
    ranks individual units. it is a method based on simple
    logarithmic relations and is used to describe growth,
    obsolescence and spread. its usefulness is especially apparent
    in a time of cuts. gives an example which shows that
    bibliometric scales of the use of periodicals can be used to
    facilitate cuts, and another in which bibliometry has been used
    to analyse the attraction exercised by a few periodicals and
    their effect on publication of articles.
