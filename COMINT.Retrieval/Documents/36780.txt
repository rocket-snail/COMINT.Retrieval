the financing of the public library. the development of
    financing methods for south african public libraries is
    sketched, from the subscription library to the partnership
    system in which costs of local libraries are shared between the
    provincial library services and the local authorities. the
    various approaches followed in the 4 south african provinces
    are indicated. a great need exists for further research on the
    financing of public libraries. public libraries in the large
    cities especially are suffering because of inadequate
    financing.
