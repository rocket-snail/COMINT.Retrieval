an associative search strategy for information retrieval.
    extends goffman's indirect method of information retrieval by
    suggesting a more flexible search strategy. queries can be
    classified by 2 criteria' the kind of answer expected and the
    way the query is defined. considers the indirect method and
    cleveland's geometrical model. discusses the proposed chaining
    process and search strategy. in its simplest version, this
    strategy can replace boolean systems, achieving much greater
    effectiveness with comparable costs.
