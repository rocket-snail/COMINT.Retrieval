lexicography' an introduction to the study of
    dictionaries. presents a structural analysis of the dictionary
    incorporating both form and content by using a typology which
    takes account equally of the purpose and linguistic scope of
    each type. the structure of the dictionary entry and the
    problems of definition are discussed in detail, and a
    comparison made with the thesaurus. finally the thesaurus is
    distinguished from the language of thesauri, as used in
    informatics to show the relationship between subject and
    keyword. concludes that theoretical studies about thesaurus
    construction should be based on semantics.
