the low frequency noise of the geomagnetic field grenets
    investigations of the source of disturbances are discussed
    observations made in the sahara are reported a telephone cable
    formed into a circular loop of diameter was used as aerial in
    conjunction with a multistage amplifier and pen recorder the
    total frequency band explorable was the results indicate that
    the low frequency pulses received are almost entirely due to
    atmospherics this confirms grenets theory
