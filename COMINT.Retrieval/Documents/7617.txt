matrix analysis of logical networks a novel method of
    matrix algebra is derived for the analysis of networks
    representing logical systems too complex for conventional
    approaches using boolean algebra it is shown that truth tables
    of system blocks may be treated as matrices and that logical
    operations on such matrices can be performed efficiently
