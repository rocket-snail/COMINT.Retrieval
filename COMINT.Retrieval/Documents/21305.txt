transistor circuits for use with gas filled multicathode
    counter valves transistors are used in conjunction with
    dekatrons to provide a logical circuit the combination is run
    off a low voltage supply the hv to the dekatrons being supplied
    by a transistor dc converter a block of these circuits is made
    to function successfully in a telephone exchange
