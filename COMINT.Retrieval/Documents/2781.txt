sim litude and anode material effects in h and d
    discharges below the critical pressure the breakdown potentials
    of h and d gases were determined below the critical pressure in
    two similarly shaped discharge valves of different size with
    stainless steel anodes and cathodes both gases obeyed paschens
    law when the anodes were made of pb or al some deviations were
    observed possibly resulting from deposition of anode material
    on the cathode
