t t n the floating probe method for the measurement of
    ionized gas revised expressions are obtained for the positive
    ion current and electron temperature for the usual double probe
    method a triple probe method is proposed for measurement of
    energy distribution in electrodeless or discharges and the
    applicability of the techniques is discussed
