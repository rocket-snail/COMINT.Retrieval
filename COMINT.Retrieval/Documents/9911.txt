spin wave analysis of ferromagnetic resonance in
    polycrystalline ferrites dipolar interaction is taken into
    account by means of the spin wave formalism crystalline
    anisotropy and the polycrystalline nature of the material cause
    the homogeneous mode of precession to interact with spin waves
    whose wavelength is of the order of or larger than the average
    linear grain size the theory predicts a very strong frequency
    and shape dependence of the line width when the homogeneous
    mode is approximately degenerate with long wavelength spin
    waves propagating normal to the dc field
