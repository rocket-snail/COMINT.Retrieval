measurement and calculation of carrier frequency
    transients a carrier modulated by rectangular pulses is passed
    through a transmission system and the output is observed
    oscillographically the timebase being synchronized by the
    pulses the oscillogram thus displays the envelope of outputs
    for different carrier phases at initiation of the pulses it is
    shown mathematically that this envelope corresponds with the
    result obtained ae theory is outlined and a survey is made of
    known applications such as attenuators modulators gyrators etc
    advantages and disadvantages of devices based on this effect
    are compared with those of devices based on the faraday effect
    deeper understanding of the physical processes involved is
    necessary for further practical development
