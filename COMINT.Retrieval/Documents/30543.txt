negative feedback tone control the circuit described
    provides independent control of bass and treble response
    without switching the rc arrangement on each side of a bass
    control potentiometer is made symmetrical so that it may be
    combined in the feedback line with a treble control circuit the
    potentiometer of which has an earthed centre tap at medium and
    high frequencies p is effectively shorted with both
    potentiometers at a middle setting response is level
