the library situation in england' increasing demand for
    self-financing of service improvements. examines the state of
    libraries in the uk. during the last 5 years public libraries
    especially have been subject to cuts resulting in fewer
    acquisitions, closure of branches, reduced opening hours and
    freezing of staff posts. at the same time attempts are made to
    increase income through increased fines and sale of discarded
    material and pamphlets, although lending fees have not yet been
    imposed. introduction of automation in libraries is seen by
    many as a means of reducing staff expenditure and improving
    services to the public, especially commerce and industry. the
    library provision for children, never very good compared to
    danish public libraries, has been struck particularly hard by
    the cuts. the reaction against the cuts has been led by nalgo
    in the form of work stoppages and by the library association as
    protests to the authorities.
