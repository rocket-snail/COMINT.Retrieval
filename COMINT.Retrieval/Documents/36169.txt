volt second transfer efficiency in fast response magnetic
    amplifiers part and control analysis for the case of finite
    control circuit resistance and non ideal core characteristics
    defined as the summation of the quotients of the square of the
    number of turns and the circuit resistance for all control
    circuits is shown to be a basic reactor parameter
