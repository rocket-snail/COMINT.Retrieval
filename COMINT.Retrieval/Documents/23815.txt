berne municipal and university library: extracts from the
    annual report 1980. loans have increased by almost 15% during
    the year. school children now comprise 1/3 of the total number
    of users. in spite of a larger book fund, fewer purchases than
    last year were made but staff are catching up on the
    cataloguing backlog. shortage of space is a problem; the
    library must play a key role in university planning. because of
    processing, storage and running costs, each book costs more
    than its purchasing price; the use of electronic data
    processing will not save much money but will improve services.
    work is proceeding on the buhlplatz faculty library, to be
    opened in autumn 81, where biological and geological material
    from various institute libraries will be amalgamated.
