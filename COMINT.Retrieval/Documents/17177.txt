the decilog a unit for logarithmic measurement
    difficulties resulting from an extended use of the term decibel
    are discussed suggested new logarithmic units of ratio are
    reviewed it is proposed to supplement the decibel by
    introducing the decilog whose value is such that the number of
    decilogs is equal to times the logarithm to the base of the
    ratio
