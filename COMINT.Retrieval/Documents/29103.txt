the frequency of nonlinear plasma oscillations the
    frequency of plane standing waves of electrons moving through a
    back ground of infinitely heavy ions is independent of
    amplitude if the electron velocity is a unique function of
    position this is not true for spherical and cylindrical plasma
    oscillations
