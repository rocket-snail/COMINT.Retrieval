dipole field type magnetic disturbances and auroral
    activities the magnetic perturbation produced at the ground by
    the current system associated with an electric dipole at is
    calculated magneto grams obtained during an auroral display are
    analysed to deduce the position ad motion of the equivalent
    dipoles these correspond closely to prominent visual auroral
    forms
