contribution to scientific and technological progress.
    the institute of semiconductors in botevgrad has been in
    operation for 14 years now. during that period the library has
    been an integral part of the institute. the library staff of 2
    cater at present for 116 research workers, all graduates. many
    of them are engaged in postgraduate studies. as semiconductors'
    technology is a highly specialised field, there are only 27,000
    volumes in stock, in russian, bulgarian, english, german and
    other languages. twice a month, an information news bulletin on
    acquisitions is issued, and an effort is made to secure any
    required item. in 1980, nearly 500 books, periodicals,
    standards, patents, theses and other special papers were
    supplied by using interlending services of the central
    scientific and technical library, the cyril and methodius
    national library, and the kliment okhridski university library,
    all in sofia.
