the university library's task of forming a system
    relative to the competence of the advisory and decision-making
    bodies of a large university. the freie universitat berlin
    (berlin university) in west berlin was taken as an example for
    analysis and suggestions concerning the university library's
    task of forming a library system. success in this task does not
    depend on the laws governing the library but is affected by the
    existing structure of the competent university bodies. the
    university library is required by law to coordinate, supervise
    and advise the department libraries. in order to carry out this
    task the system planning department must be completely
    integrated into the university internal information stream, it
    must be able to introduce initiatives into the advisory and
    decision-making procedures of the university and follow these
    up. this interdependent work was studied in detail at the
    berlin university. weak points in the system were analysed and
    suggestions for reducing prejud icial effects were made. this
    study should give rise to internal discussion at the university
    concerned and may also be of interest to other external
    libraries of similar structure.
