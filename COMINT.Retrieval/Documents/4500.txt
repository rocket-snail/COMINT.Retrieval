towards library unification. a text prepared by the
    public libraries section of the association des bibliothecaires
    francais (abf) to support the 1981 conference motion on library
    unification. a preliminary discussion briefly introduces the
    issues involved in establishing an integrated national network,
    in the face of a government policy of decentralisation. the abf
    programme for achieving unification in service provision,
    personnel allocation, and personnel training, is then
    elaborated. in each case details are given of the existing
    organisation of resources, the advantages of unification
    outlined, and the means of implementing a policy of integration
    indicated.
