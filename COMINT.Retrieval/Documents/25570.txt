the interaction of the terrestrial magnetic field with
    the solar corpuscular radiation the shape of the cavity between
    the earth and a neutral solar stream differs by only from a
    hemisphere of radius earth radii on the incident side but is
    elongated on the other side to a distance of the order of earth
    radii the cavity is idented at the polar latitudes where the
    current layer reverses
