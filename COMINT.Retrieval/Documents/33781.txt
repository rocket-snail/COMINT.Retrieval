some studies of geomagnetic micropulsations recordings
    made at four stations in australia are analysed the period of
    the continuous type of oscillation increases with latitude and
    also varies diurnally the damped trains of oscillations
    occurring mainly near midnight are followed by magnetic bays
    with an average delay of about min effects observed during
    magnetic storms are discussed
