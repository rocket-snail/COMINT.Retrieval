integrating the data encryption standard into computer
    networks. the nbs data encryption standard may be integrated
    into computer networks to protect personal (nonshared) files,
    to communicate securely both on- and off-line with local and
    remote users, to protect against key substitution, to
    authenticate data, and to provide digital signatures using a
    nonpublic key encryption algorithm.
