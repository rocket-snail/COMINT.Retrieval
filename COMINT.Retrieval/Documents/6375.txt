the effective leaking resistance of several types of
    capacitors a rapid method of measuring leakage resistance based
    on rate of charge is described variation of leakage resistance
    with time was measured for commercial capacitors of values
    ranging from with various dielectrics at temperatures ranging
    from in most cases the best properties were exhibited by a
    capacitor having a polytetrafluoroethy dielectric
