ionized irregularities and wing motion in the ionosphere
    the motion of irregularities in electron density are studied on
    the basis of a three dimensional model electrodynamic effects
    are slight in the e region under magnetically quiet conditions
    but are appreciable in the f region and even in the e region
    for disturbed conditions at high latitudes a general discussion
    on the stability and lifetime of regions of irregular electron
    density is given
