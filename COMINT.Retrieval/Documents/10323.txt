radio measurements and auroral electron densities
    simultaneous recordings of and echoes from auroral clouds were
    made at sakatoon a large number of echoes at were found for
    which there were no corresponding echoes at and the echo
    amplitude ratio for the two frequencies varied widely critical
    reflections from small volumes of intense ionization seem the
    most probable explanation of these observations where intense
    auroral display are concerned this would involve electron
    densities of the order of cm in small volumes of the aurora for
    periods of time short in comparison with the duration of the
    display
