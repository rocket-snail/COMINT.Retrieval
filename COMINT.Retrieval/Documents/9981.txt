an attempt to simplify coding for the manchester
    electronic computer two main simplifications are made both at
    the cost of increased machine time to ensure that all
    quantities involved in a calculation are represented to the
    required degree of accuracy every number occurring is
    associated with its own scale factor again in using the two
    levels of storage provided arrangements are made so that
    instructions are written out as if for a one level store a
    program in the simplified form is described
