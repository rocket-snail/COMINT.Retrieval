circulation in the flow of electricity diracs new
    variables kelvins circulation theorems are shown to be
    applicable to the generalized momentum vector in the
    relativistic flow of electricity vortex filaments become vortex
    ribbons in space time and diracs variables and are identified
    as the parameters which characterize the family of vortex
    ribbons
