downhill all the way: publishing in the 80s. discusses
    (with particular reference to australia) the rising cost of
    publishing, marketing, and distributing books; the effects of
    buyer resistance to high prices (ever more books remaindered or
    pulped); pressures on scholarly book publishers; the need for
    publishers to know their customers and carefully evaluate the
    market for each book; and the plight of educational and trade
    publishers. predicts that those publishers who want to survive
    beyond the 1980s will need to start looking now at what the
    technological revolution will mean for them.
