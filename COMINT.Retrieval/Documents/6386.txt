a transistor pulse amplifier using external regenerated
    pulses having desired waveforms as required in synchronous
    serial computers are obtained by means of a circuit using a
    point contact transistor operated as an over driven amplifier
    with external feedback provision is made for synchronizing the
    output pulses with a master clock transformer coupling provides
    dc restoration
