acceleration of charged particles in travelling or stand
    ng electromagnetic waves the average lorentz force acting on a
    charged particle in an e m field depends on the resonance
    properties of the motion of the particles and on the spread in
    their transverse momentum conditions under which continuous
    acceleration can be achieved by spatial variation of the
    particle oscillation parameters are discussed
