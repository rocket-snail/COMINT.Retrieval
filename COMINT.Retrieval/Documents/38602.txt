the ring current and the outer atmosphere by
    hydromagnetic wave propagation through the ionosphere changes
    in the geomagnetic field at ground level would be delayed less
    than one min after ring current changes at several earth radii
    the electric current associated with particle motions in the
    van allen belts is examined
