transistor oscillators the characteristics of transistor
    oscillators are established by analysis in which the
    conductance form of the transistor equations is used the
    following circuits are considered transistor with frequency
    determining quadripole and overall feedback as in but with
    transformer coupling between transistor and quadripole
    transistor oscillator with a arrangement of three parallel
    connected tuned circuits
