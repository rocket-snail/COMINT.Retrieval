improving user training for young people. the aim of user
    training is to develop the ability of the user to make full use
    of library stock and facilities. the user must understand the
    principles of the classification systems used in the public and
    trade union libraries. a group called library work with young
    people examined the way in which a brochure introducing young
    people to library use was being used in practice. more young
    people should be involved in user training through increased
    cooperation with teachers at training colleges and instructors
    of apprentices. user training sessions should be planned to
    involve young people actively, taking their special interests
    into consideration. it is also important that library staff
    should keep abreast of current developments in user training
    methods and exchange information with other libraries in the
    district.
