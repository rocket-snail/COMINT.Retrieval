preliminary results of ionospheric observations of the
    sola eclipse of june ionosphere soundings were made in the o
    zone of totality from a ship off the coast of southern norway a
    panoramic instrument was used covering the frequency range in a
    second instrument was used for absorption measurements at and
    the variation of the maximum electron concentrations for the
    different layers is shown graphically the recombination
    coefficients are estimated from the delay between the optically
    and the ionospherically observed maximum phase and by trying
    different values in the equilibrium equation expressings the
    dependence of electron concentration on unobscured fraction of
    the solar disk the recombination coefficient for a normal law
    is greater than or equal to for the e and f layers and over for
    the f layer
