library research. the library research programme of the
    department of library and information science of tampere
    university dates from 1976. the areas for research are'
    libraries and information services in society; production of
    information and its users; storage systems; and administration
    and planning. these tend to be library oriented rather than
    user/community oriented. future programmes should identify
    problems not offer solutions. perhaps it would be most fruitful
    to see library and information science as a part of sociology.
    the new post of assistant professor in the department at the
    university should also have the responsibility for research
    development.
