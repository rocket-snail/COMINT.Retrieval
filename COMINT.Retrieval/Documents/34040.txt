lazard brothers' use of microfilm. lazard brothers is one
    of london's leading merchant banks, managed in 3 principal
    divisions-banking, corporate finance, and investment
    management. a change of premises resulted in a lack of space
    for the bank's archives, and the firms o&m section was
    called upon to undertake a complete study of the problem, with
    1 remit to create a microfilm programme. a kodak 'reliant' 450
    microfilmer was used to film (by now) 5 million documents, and
    any document can be found within 2 minutes of a request being
    received. the whole collection is housed in 2 filing cabinets.
    describes in detail the storage system and its complementary
    destruction of record report system, whereby redundant material
    is weeded out of the collection.
