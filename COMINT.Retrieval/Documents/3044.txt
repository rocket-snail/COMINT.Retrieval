a mathematical approach to relations in thesauri.
    presents a brief background of set theory and relations
    including equivalence and ordering relations. proposes 4
    working hypotheses concerned with thesauri relations. explores
    the possibility of generating an equivalence class of
    descriptors from a single descriptor to aid
    information/document retrieval. provides a new mathematical
    approach to a thesaurus and its relations and compares it
    against the traditional way of representing a thesaurus.
    proposes new areas for investigation in this direction.
