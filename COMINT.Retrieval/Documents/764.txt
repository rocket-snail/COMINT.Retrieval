mechanism of discharge between plane plates the problem
    is considered using the diffusion theory of the positive column
    with a term added to take account of the character of the
    discharge measurements show that the electron temperature is
    higher than in a discharge under similar conditions a theory is
    proposed which explains the dependence of the running potential
    on frequency
