evaluating undergraduate library instruction at the ohio
    state university. as a large-scale library instruction
    programme (lip) was implemented at ohio state university, it
    was evaluated at each stage by means of questionnaires. data
    derived from the questionnaires helped change the content of
    the lip lectures, the type of materials distributed to the
    students, and the format of the exercises. it also evaluated
    the success the programme had in reaching incoming students and
    in giving them experience in using library tools. separate
    surveys also showed that students retained their skills after a
    period of time, improved their attitudes towards the library,
    and increased their use of library resources.
