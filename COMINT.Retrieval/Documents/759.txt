molecular theory of the dielectric constant a theory of
    the static dielectric constant is developed on a quantum
    mechanical basis by introducing the concept of local field a
    molecular version of the general theory is obtained it is shown
    that such a molecular theory is fundamentally ineffective in
    accounting for the observed results within the experimental
    accuracy
