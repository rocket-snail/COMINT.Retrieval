high temperature area type titanium dioxide rectifiers
    modifications in the methods of production including the
    deliberate introduction of impurities have led to improvements
    over the performance reported previously in respect of maximum
    operating temperature reverse forward resistance ratio and
    reproducibility of characteristics satisfactory operation at
    temperatures above for hundreds of hours is reported
