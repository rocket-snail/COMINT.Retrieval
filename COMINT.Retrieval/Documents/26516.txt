a method for interpreting the dispersion curves of
    whistlers an analytical solution to the problem of determining
    the dispersion of a whistler from a known electron density in
    the outer atmosphere is formulated the results are then applied
    to the inverse problem of deducing the variation in electron
    density from the dispersion curve a numerical example is
    given
