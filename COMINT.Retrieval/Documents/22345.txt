browsing in data bases. considers the tasks of trying to
    find similarities between the causes of the crashes of several
    aircraft of a common type, the causes or early warning signs
    for various diseases, the characteristics of stocks with high
    growth potential or advanced warnings of several weather
    conditions. all of these tasks require a large amount of data
    and valuable time spent sifting through the data. a browsing
    computer system could also perform these tasks. this thesis
    examines one possible organisation for a browsing system
    containing models and heuristics. the models describe the
    organisation of the data base and the objects from which the
    data was gathered.
