comparison of different systems in searching for
    metallurgical information. a comparison has been made between
    different data bases in searching for metallurgical information
    in 4 systems publicly available in europe' esa-quest,
    lockheed-dialog, inka-grips and thermodata. a few different
    search profiles were prepared in order to test the usefulness
    of the different systems. the analysis of search costs was
    included in the survey. an outline was given of facilities for
    getting the documents. the usefulness of the information for
    research and development work was checked by interviewing the
    customers. the utility of the new factual data bank included in
    the thermodata system was emphasised.
