book clubs and authors' royalties. in the netherlands
    bookclubs have recently been severely criticised by authors for
    paying much smaller royalties than the normal booktrade. the
    1st bookclub in the netherlands was founded in 1937 and there
    are now 6 registered clubs with a total membership of approx. 1
    1/2 million members. the market share of the bookclubs in the
    netherlands has risen from 2% in 1966 to 24% in 1980. the
    removal of the collective price agreement on books would also
    be disastrous for the smaller bookshops and publishers and for
    lesser-known authors. booksellers and publishers must now come
    to a trading arrangement with the bookclubs. it is, however,
    fortunate that the larger bookclubs are themselves part of the
    publishing trade.
