university libraries' standards and statistics. the
    arl-acrl standards for university libraries do not present
    quantitative standards, but rather place their emphasis on the
    performance of university libraries. through the statistical
    techniques of correlation and regression, discriminant
    analysis, and principal component analysis it is possible to
    analyse university library data and to derive minimal criteria
    that statistically distinguish university libraries from other
    kinds of academic libraries. these criteria look very much like
    standards, but still fail to relate library size and resources
    deployed to library performance.
