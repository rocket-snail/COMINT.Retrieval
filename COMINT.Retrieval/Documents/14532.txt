excerpts from my bouboulina file. paper presented at the
    41st conference of the graduate library school, university of
    chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access to services and
    materials in school and public libraries. there are important
    differences between a textbook author's agreeing to allow
    stickers to be placed over portions of her book found
    objectionable by a school administration and a successful
    writer's agreeing to expurgate portions of his novel to cut
    costs. examines these differences by tracing the chain of
    command of censorship with which authors must deal from
    encounters between an author on 1 side and editors, publishers,
    teachers, and school administrators on the other. examples from
    each link in the chain are illustrated with excerpts from the
    author's personal file on censorship, called
    'bouboulina'.
