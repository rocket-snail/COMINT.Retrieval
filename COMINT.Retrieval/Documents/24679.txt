the future of catalogers and cataloging. the past few
    years have seen many changes in the cataloguing departments of
    us research libraries. reduced budgets, less emphasis on
    perfection, greater use of library assistants, standardisation,
    and automation have had a profound effect upon the professional
    responsibility of cataloguers. if current trends continue,
    future emphasis will be on the sharing of high quality
    bibliographic records through a national network. as the amount
    of original cataloguing decreases, the cataloguer of the future
    will more likely be a manager with responsibility for the
    library's bibliographic control system. only in larger research
    institutions will a significant amount of original cataloguing
    remain. another possible scenario will be the disappearance of
    cataloguers as public and technical services staff merge into
    integrated subject units.
