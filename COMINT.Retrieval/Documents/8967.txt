study of a flip flop with four positions of equilibrium
    by the methods of topological analysis analysis is presented in
    general terms for a two stage circuit assuming square law valve
    characteristics three possible states identified are static
    dynamic and impulse the eccles jordan and multivibrator
    circuits are particular cases an experimental circuit has been
    designed its performance agreed well with the
    predictions
