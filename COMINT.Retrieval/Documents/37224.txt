junction transistors at high frequencies methods of
    stabilizing transistor amplifiers are discussed and formulae
    are presented for calculating the characteristics of a linear
    amplifier at any frequency and for determining the principal
    parameters of junction transistors with common emitter common
    base or common collector connections curves are given of
    maximum gain as a function of frequency
