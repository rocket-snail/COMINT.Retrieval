the feasibility of an international multilateral unesco
    convention on the universal availability of publications. the
    adoption of a multilateral international convention on the
    universal availability of publications (uap) is the best
    possible guarantee for the practical implementation of the
    decisions and recommendations of the unesco uap conference to
    be held in 1981-82. this convention should declare the
    principle of uap and should determine the basic obligations of
    national governments in the creation of the national
    infrastructure of a uap system. international issues to be
    considered are the roles of unesco and ifla, formation of an
    international collection of publications, adjustments of
    existing international agreements to the principles of uap, and
    provision for a special unesco fund for uap. report not
    available from ntis.
