form or function? an analysis of the serials department
    in the modern academic library. explores how separate serials
    procedures from the rest of the stock processing developed in
    us academic libraries and whether today the integration of
    those procedures is possible and desirable. concludes that the
    organisation of procedures by function and the growing use of
    automation can result in more efficient processing and better
    service and may also lead to the dissolution of technical
    services as they are known today and to a new definition of
    library work whereby work is organised by subject and/or
    service and by function within a subject, not by format.
