correlation of amplitude and phase fluctuations in wave
    propagation in a statistically inhomo geneous medium the cases
    considered are the correlation of fluctuations of amplitude and
    phase at a single receiving point and the correlation of
    amplitude pr phase fluctuations at different receiving points
    in the case of large sized inhomogeneities the correlation
    between the amplitude or phase fluctuations extends over a
    range of the same order as the correlation between the random
    inhomogeneities of the medium itself
