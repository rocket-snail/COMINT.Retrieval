methodological guidance to libraries. the aim of the
    communist party of bulgaria is to transform all bulgarian
    citizens into harmonious personalities. this effort requires
    substantial participation by libraries, both public and
    special. the number of readers and frequency of loans must be
    monitored. thus librarians must become familiar not only with
    their readers' interests but also with the details of the
    literature presented to them. librarians must not be left alone
    but assisted and guided even more than before by expert
    advisers, working in particular at the methodological centres
    of regional central libraries. their work must be adapted to
    the new, much more complicated requirements of the 1980s and be
    more efficient, too. bureaucracy and formalism have to be
    eliminated, activities much better coordinated. the cyril and
    methodius national library in sofia must retain leadership in
    this field.
