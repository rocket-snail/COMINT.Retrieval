electron interaction in solids collective approach to the
    dielectric constant a quantum theory of the dielectric constant
    for solids of both low and high polarizability is developed
    from first principles in the latter case the approach used is
    collective in that the long range part of the electron
    interaction is described by the plasmon field both the static
    and frequency dependent dielectric constant are derived it is
    shown that the interaction between electrons may be described
    in terms of the dielectric constant of the solid provided the
    electrons in question form a small minority group which can be
    isolated from the much larger majority electron group
