developments in optical disc technology and the
    implications for information storage and retrieval. based on
    the findings of the author's 1-month visit to the usa in
    apr-may 80 and a subsequent brief visit to philips data systems
    in the netherlands, during which he discussed optical discs
    with manufacturers and prospective users. indicates that
    prospects for the use of optical discs in textual and graphical
    information storage and retrieval are good. there are
    applications for replicated video discs, especially if they can
    be mastered with digitally coded information, but the major
    impact will come with the digital optical recording systems
    that provide 'read and write' facilities.
