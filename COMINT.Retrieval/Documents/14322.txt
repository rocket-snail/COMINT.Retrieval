synthesis of feedback control systems by means of pole
    and zero location of the closed loop function a mathematical
    description of the desired frequency response based on the
    location of the poles and zeros of the closed loop function is
    given which ensures that the specifications of velocity or
    acceleration error constant bandwidth and relative stability
    will be met and which provides for acceptable system transient
    response algebraic manipulation yields the transfer function of
    the main loop and subsidiary feedback loop corrective networks
    required to meet the specifications
