relation between the position and the sense of
    polarization of solar radio storms observations of solar storm
    centres made with the great interferometer t nancay at have
    been related to measurements of polarization made at nera
    netherlands at results show that the radiation from storm
    centres in the northern solar hemisphere has a predominantly
    right hand polarization and that from the southern left hand
