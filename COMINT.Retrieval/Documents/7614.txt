frequency stepper for radio propagation tests full
    circuit details are given of a stepped frequency exciter unit
    controlling a pulse transmitter and receiver at widely
    separated locations the range is covered in steps at sec
    intervals and crystals are used as reference frequency sources
    and frequency control is achieved by means of a beam deflection
    tube transmitter and receiver circuits are briefly described
    the transmitter radiates pulses with repetition frequency or
    and output power
