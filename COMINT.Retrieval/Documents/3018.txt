origin of the e layer of the ionosphere the electron
    densities for the and f layers resulting from photo ionization
    of molecular and atomic oxygen are calculated on the basis of
    the work by moses and wu on the distribution of o and of o in
    and above the oxygen dissociation layer of and of while the
    results are in reasonable agreement with observations for the e
    layer it is not possible to account for the observed value of
    recombination coefficient for the f layer by any theory based
    on processes involving only oxygen atoms and molecules
