nyquists and thevenins theorems generalized for
    nonreciprocal linear networks theory of nonreciprocal networks
    such as those including ferrites is developed taking account of
    internal noise sources the system ca be treated as the
    combination of a source free network together with a set of
    correlated noise current or noise voltage generators
    modifications of the treatment are indicated for dealing with
    cases whee the actual noise sources are at different
    temperatures as in the problem of determining the noise
    correlation between two receiver channels connected to a
    gydetermination of the frequency and phase characteristics of a
    network for a given at enuation curve a modification of the
    graphical method developed by baum of is described for deriving
    a realizable attenuation characteristic approximating to the
    given one
