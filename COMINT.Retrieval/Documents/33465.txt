the secondary electron emission of sodium and zinc
    experiments are described in which the metal to be examined was
    deposited on a copper target block in a valve with a guiding
    grid accurately aligned with a collector grid the collector
    potential was high enough for saturation secondary current to
    introduce the sodium an electrolytic method was used for sodium
    the maximum secondary emission factor reached a peak value of
    during the coating process and then fell to a constant value of
    ccurring at a target potential of for zinc the maximum value of
    occurred at a target potential of
