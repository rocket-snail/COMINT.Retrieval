the input impedance and transimpedance of if transformers
    formulae are derived for the conventional if transformer
    consisting f two coupled circuits tuned to the same frequency
    the relation between transimpedance and input impedance
    variations and the form of the frequency response curve are
    investigated the method of constructing polar diagrams is
    explained and diagrams are shown for the two impedances for
    various values of the parameters their usefulness in the study
    of feedback phenomena particularly feedback from valve anode to
    grid is indicated
