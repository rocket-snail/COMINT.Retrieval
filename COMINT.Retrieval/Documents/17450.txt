theory of diffraction by a cylinder taking account of the
    surface wave maxima and minima observed by a limback in
    diffraction of centimetre em waves by metal cylinders are found
    to be due to interference between the waves geometrically
    reflected from the cylinder surface and the surface wave
    creeping round to the b ck of the cylinder quantitative
    calculations based on the integral equations of the diffraction
    theory of give results in good agreement with experiment
