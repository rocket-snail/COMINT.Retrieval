the theory of elementary excitations in atomic
    semiconductors the simplest model of an atomic semiconductor is
    considered in which every atom has a saturated valence shell
    with two electrons electrons holes ortho and para exitons are
    considered as elementary excitations and the hamiltonian
    describing the system is derived taking account of interaction
    between them
