the design of linear phase low pass filters discussion
    general design principles are outlined and a method applicable
    to certain low pass filters required in television equipment is
    described adequate phase linearity of response can be obtained
    over the whole pass band only by limiting the discrimination
    required in the attenuation region of the insertion loss
    characteristic practical examples include a set of low pass
    filters with linear phase characteristics from zero nearly to
    their cut off frequencies which range from to an asymmetric
    sideband filter with a cut off frequency of and phase linearity
    from to with discrimination above
