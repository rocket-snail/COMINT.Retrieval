preventive conservation for map collections. the physical
    care of maps and plans is a problem for many persons used to
    working with more traditional forms of library and archival
    materials. the map curator, as well as being familiar with
    broad conservation measures such as proper environmental
    conditions, needs to develop more specialised knowledge of
    storage possibilities and techniques for handling oversized
    material. conservation methods that have proven useful in map
    collections and guidelines for researchers and staff are
    described.
