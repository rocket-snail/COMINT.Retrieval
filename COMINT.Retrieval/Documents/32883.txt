striated high frequency discharge the forming of striae
    in ne and ar at a pressure of mm hg by hf fields of frequencies
    and is described in symmetrical hf discharge the striae are
    stationary but on disturbing the symmetry eg by using
    electrodes of unequal dimensions the striae are set in motion
    their velocity in electropositive gas is of the order of the
    drift velocity of the positive ions both external and internal
    electrodes were used in the experiments
