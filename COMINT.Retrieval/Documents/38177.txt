comparison of records of the horizontal component of the
    terrestrial magnetic field at kerguelen and at heard island the
    records confirm that magnetic activity is particularly strong
    during the equinoxes the correlation coefficient for the two
    stations is about ionograms obtained during the strong magnetic
    variations are characteristic of a highly disturbed
    ionosphere
