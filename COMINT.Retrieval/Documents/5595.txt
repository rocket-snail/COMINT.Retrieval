anderson: the reluctant librarian. anderson's
    'reluctance' stems from his transfer from the new south wales
    department of agriculture to the headship of the free public
    library, sydney, during the agricultural recession in 1893.
    despite his lack of previous experience in the field, anderson
    made his mark as an administrator, in the techniques of
    librarianship, and in collection development. the library
    association of australia's h.c.l. anderson award is conferred
    for 'outstanding service to librarianship or to the library
    profession in australia'.
