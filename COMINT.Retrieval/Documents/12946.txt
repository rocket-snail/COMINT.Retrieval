quantum theory of a damped electrical oscillator and
    noise part the radiation resistance the results obtained in
    part of are extended to include damping and noise due to a
    radiation resistance and expressions for the mean square noise
    voltage and available noise power are derived which are shown
    to be the sm same as those previously obtained they are also
    extended to apply to a single mode of a cavity resonator
