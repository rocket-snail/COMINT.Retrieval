metal ultrasonic delay lines an experimental
    investigation was made with the object of finding a metal o or
    alloy suitable for the transmission of pulses at temperatures
    between and with a delay independent of temperature the effect
    of various constructions crystal attachment methods and
    materials and treatment of the delay line material was
    investigated the results are tabulated and shown graphically an
    isoelastic iron alloy containing cr and other minor
    constituents used with overcured epoxy resin quartz crystal
    attachments gave the best transmission characteristics a
