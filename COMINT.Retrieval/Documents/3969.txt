radiation of electromagnetic waves during the uniform
    motion of electric charges near an inhomogeneity the radiation
    occurring in nonuniform waveguide in which a given convection
    current is flowing and the transient radiation due to the
    passage of finite bunches of charge through ideally conducting
    grids are considered theoretically using the methods of
    perturbation theory
