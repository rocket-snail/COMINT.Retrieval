information for distance education' the open university
    distance education information project. a project in progress
    at the open university is studying distance education
    institutions as places of work, with the aim of enabling
    members to consider implications for information provision in
    this area. descriptions were collected from people with
    different activities in different types of institution, using
    the vignette method. a discussion paper will now be circulated
    to participants, presenting the general picture which emerges
    and raising issues for information provision. the burden will
    be that, viewing distance education throughout the world. it is
    not yet established as a specialism and also means different
    things in different contexts. this suggests a current need for
    a range of opportunities for information exchange, provided on
    a decentralised basis, as contrasted with formal information
    storage and retrieval facilities for distance education as a
    whole.
