galvanomagnetic effects in conductors a review of the
    hall effect and magnetoresistance in conductors with primary
    reference to metals including ferromagnetic materials
    semiconductors are mentioned briefly a physical survey of the
    whole field is first made in the second part a more
    mathematical treatment is given of some of the major problems
    involved over references
