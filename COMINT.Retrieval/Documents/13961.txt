electron resonance in ionospheric waves a new aspect of
    the investigation of travelling disturbances in the ionosphere
    is discussed which leads to a more satisfactory interpretation
    of observational data the hydrodynamic wave hypothesis of the
    earlier work of is retained but the observed perturbations in
    the electron density are attributed to a direct resonance in
    the electron oscillations regardless of any em fields which may
    be generated in the process formulae are developed for two
    distinct classes of possible resonant oscillations one
    involving and the other not involving a vertical component of
    propagation small scale disturbances above the f layer maximum
    which have been held responsible for certain radio star
    scintillations could be related to either set of
    formulae
