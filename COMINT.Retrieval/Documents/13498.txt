headaches, infiltrations and flickering before the eyes.
    discusses automation in roskilde university library (roskilde
    universitetsbibliotek (rub)). introduction of the
    samkat-project, a joint, computerised cataloguing system for
    research libraries, opens the possibility of coordinating
    accessions and cataloguing, but problems with job distribution
    will be inevitable and should be faced. the standards
    specification group in its preliminary reports on accession
    systems have sketched a system very like the one used at rub.
    when the library was established in 1971 it adopted the
    computerised cataloguing system of denmark's technical library.
    this was developed into an issue and accession system, but not
    without teething troubles. it has nevertheless brought
    advantages, such as transfer of work from routine processes to
    services. the system's output includes' order forms in fiche of
    books on order, budget control which gives accounts by subject,
    reminder lists of books not yet delivered by the bookseller,
    lists of new acquisitions. as printing is excluded on economic
    grounds, problems arise with the constant, tiring use of
    microfiche.
