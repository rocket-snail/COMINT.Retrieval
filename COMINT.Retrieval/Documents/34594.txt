electrical circuit for the direct determination of the
    energy distribution function of secondary electrons a circuit
    modification of the retarding field method is described by
    means of which the current voltage characteristic is
    differentiated this results in improved accuracy and resolution
    as compared to numerical differentiation results of
    measurements on a oxide caesium cathode are shown
    graphically
