studies of the diffraction of electromagnetic waves by
    circular apertures and complementary obstacles the near zone
    field measurements have been made of both magnetic and electric
    field strengths with diffracting apertures of diameter up to
    and normally incident waves experimental techniques for
    illuminating the aperture and probing the field are described
    wave lengths around cm afford a satisfactory compromise between
    reasonable overall dimensions on the one hand and reliability
    of measurements on the other results are shown graphically the
    predicted uniformity of the tangential magnetic field in the
    aperture plane is confirmed
