disc seal triode amplifiers the design of a resonant type
    coupling network for discseal triodes operating in the earthed
    grid connection at frequencies in the range is considered a
    coaxial form of line is adopted tuning for a small range can be
    by a screw or for a larger range by a built in capacitance
    complete amplifiers can give output and gain using three
    stages
