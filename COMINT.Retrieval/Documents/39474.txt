a preliminary model atmosphere based on rocket and
    satellite data a model atmosphere is described for the height
    range km and values of density pressure and scale height are
    tabulated as functions of altitude discrepancies between data
    from various sources are examined and it is estimated that they
    are within the limits to be expected from latitude variations
    and the uncertainties of experimental observations
