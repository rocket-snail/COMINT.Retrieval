use of ferromagnetic materials in electronic tuning of
    radiofrequency components the change of the incremental
    permeability of a core of ferrite material due to a secondary
    superimposed magnetic field is discussed the effect is utilized
    in the design of toroidal inductors whose inductance can be
    varied by altering the current in an auxiliary winding
    inductors of this type are incorporated in a receiver tunable
    from to with a bandwidth of at and of at the power required in
    the auxiliary tuning coil is a variable inductor has been
    developed whose volume is wi weight slightly and tuning range
    for applied power of in the frequency band falling to in the
    band see also electronics
