est orption which is much greater than that of hydrogen
    takes place in two stages instantaneous covering of the film by
    a monatomic layer gradual penetration of the oxygen atoms into
    the film the quantity of sorbed oxygen is independent of the
    gas pressure but depends on temperature oxygen covered ni films
    have catalytic reactions with hydrogen on the other hand
    hydrogen films have no effect on the sorption of oxygen
