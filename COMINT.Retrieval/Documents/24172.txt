a study of the enhanced ionization produced by solar
    protons during a polar cap absorption event the electron
    density height profiles produced by solar protons are examined
    theoretically the cosmic noise absorption expected from these
    profiles are compared with experimental data particular
    attention is paid to the sunrise and sunset periods the
    presence of o alone is insufficient to account for the
    observations at these times
