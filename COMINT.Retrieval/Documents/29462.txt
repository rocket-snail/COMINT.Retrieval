compilation of a filter catalogue a discussion of the
    desirable features of a catalogue in which all numerical data
    required in designing reactance quadripoles by the insertion
    loss method are assembled an appendix gives formulae linking
    the reflection factor and four insertion loss parameters values
    of the insertion loss parameters are tabulated for values of
    reflection coefficient ranging from to in unit steps
