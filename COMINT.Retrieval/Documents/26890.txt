intensities of discrete radio sources in cygnus and
    cassiopeia at measured intensities are and for the sources in
    cassiopeia and cygnus respectively comparison with intensities
    measured previously at higher frequencies indicates that in the
    spectrum of the cassiopeia source intensity is proportional to
    frequency the variation in the cygnus source being similar
    except at lower frequencies where the rate of increase of
    intensity is reduced
