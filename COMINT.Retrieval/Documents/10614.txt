photoionization heating in the f region of the atmosphere
    an estimate of the total f region heating due to
    photoionization is made based on a comparison of theoretical
    and observed models of several atmospheric parameters the heat
    flux due to photoionization is estimated to be approximately
    erg cm sec which would be a major if not predominant source of
    heat in this region
