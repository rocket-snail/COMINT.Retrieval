evolution of u.s. domestic satellite communications.
    traces the salient phases of the evolution of us domestic
    satellite communications from the proposals advanced during
    1965-67 to the events which culminated in the 'open entry'
    policy announced by the federal communication commission in
    early 1970. the applications submitted by 8 entities in 1971
    are briefly reviewed and various constraints which reduced the
    number of separate systems that eventually attained operational
    status are surveyed. outlines 4 systems (those of western
    union, american satellite corporation, rca, and comsat
    general/at&t-gsat), discusses the forthcoming all-digital
    communications satellite system of sbs, and looks ahead to
    future systems and services.
