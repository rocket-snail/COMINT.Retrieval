the random occurrence of meteors in the upper atmosphere
    the distribution of time intervals between bursts of signals
    over a path was studied statistically using data obtained in
    two periods of two hours and bursts respectively results were
    consistent with forward scattering from meteor trails produced
    by random entry of meteors into the atmosphere
