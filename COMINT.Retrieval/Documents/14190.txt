waves in a rarefied ionized gas propagated transverse to
    an external magnetic field three modes of plane waves in which
    the perturbed magnetic field is parallel to the external
    magnetic field can be propagated transverse to the external
    magnetic field in a collision free and fully ionized gas in the
    hf limit the three modes behave respectively as em electron
    sound and ion sound waves
