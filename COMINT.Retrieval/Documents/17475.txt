the law for local authority cultural activities is one
    more on the road for legislating cultural activities. the new
    law came into effect at the beginning of 1981. a local
    authority has to set up a committee for cultural activities.
    out of 84 towns only 9 had such a committee at the beginning of
    this year. all other types of local authorities, 150 of them,
    did not have one. the duties of the committees are the
    oversight and instigation of cultural activities, cooperation
    between different types of activities publicity, provision of
    accommodation, and budget. from 1982 state grants will be
    available for staff and organisation costs. the new law should
    ease the work of libraries and librarians who until now have
    been responsible for the organisation of many of the local
    cultural activities.
