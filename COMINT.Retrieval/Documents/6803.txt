transmission of electromagnetic waves through
    inhomogeneous layers layers are considered in which the
    dielectric constant is graded from the value unity at each face
    to a maximum value at the mid plane the variation being either
    linear or exponential dielectrics are prepared satisfying this
    specification by forming ordinary homogeneous materials into a
    series of wedges or the like thus producing a space periodic
    structure reflection factor measurements made in free space and
    in waveguides are reported variation of reflection factor with
    layer thickness is shown graphically for moltopren paraffin and
    trolitul variation with angle of incidence is shown for
    trolitul the experimental results are compared with values of
    the reflection factor calculated from solutions of maxwells
    equations for the appropriate conditions such structures can
    give good transmission of microwaves over a wide frequency
    band
