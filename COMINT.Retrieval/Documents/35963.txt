continuing) education in handling scientific information'
    a necessity for a (wise) education policy survey held in the
    netherlands in 1979 showed that less than 50% of
    recently-graduated students were able to perform literature
    searches in their own subjects effectively. the problem was
    recognised in 1973 by the commissie algemene vraagstukken
    universitair bibliotheekwezen (committee on general affairs in
    university libraries) which recommended courses of instruction
    be given to students in the use of libraries and information
    sources. more recently the dutch government in a policy
    document issued in 1980 recognised the growing need for access
    to information in a modern, highly-industrialised and complex
    society. priority should be given to providing courses in
    library instruction in both schools and universities to enable
    everyone to participate fully in the information society of the
    future.
