coefficients for the rapid reduction of records to
    profiles without computing aids the tables of coefficients can
    be used for the ordinary ray at any station having aa magnetic
    dip less than the sensitivity of the coefficients to dip angle
    and gyrofrequency is discussed and comparisons are made with
    the profiles produced using the budden matrix method
