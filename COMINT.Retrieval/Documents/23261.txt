radiation from a point charge moving uniformly along the
    surface of an isotropic medium energy emitted per unit of time
    by a particle moving along a surface in a nondispersive is
    calculated relativistic conditions and for magnetic and fe
    expressions are derived for relativistic and norrite type media
