some perturbation effects in microwave cavities operating
    in degenerate modes theoretical investigation of the
    perturbation caused by introducing a metal rod into a
    cylindrical cavity operating in the companion modes te and tm
    the changes in q value and resonance frequency are different
    for the two modes the magnitudes of these changes as dependent
    on the radius and depth of insertion of the rod are
    considered
