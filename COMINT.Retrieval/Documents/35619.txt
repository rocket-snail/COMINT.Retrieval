optimum design of two-computer networks. 2 important
    problems in designing computer networks are investigated and
    solved for 2-computer networks' assignment of programme modules
    and data files to the different computers in the network and
    selection of capacities in the network. the interdependences of
    an application programme's modules and files are represented,
    using a graph model. a branch-and-bound algorithm is developed
    to minimise programme execution time. a 2nd, earlier-developed
    algorithm is used with the 1st algorithm to allocate a fixed
    number of dollars among the network's subsystems such that the
    programme execution time is again minimised. presents results
    obtained by using the algorithms with experimentally-measured
    data.
