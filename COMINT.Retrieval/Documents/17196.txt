vertical drift in the e layer of the ionosphere during
    geomagnetic disturbances the velocity is estimated of the
    vertical drift due to geomagnetic disturbances the possible
    rise of the e layer is shown to be a few hundred metres only
    which cannot be measured by ionospheric recorders for an
    investigation of f layer movements see of june
