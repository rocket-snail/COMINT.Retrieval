people should broaden their outlook: some observations on
    the 'narrow' catchword. librarians still cope badly with the
    principle of the narrow catchword because their terminological
    control is still ineffective. the narrow catchword uses precise
    terminology and separates related material; the broad catchword
    covers wide subject areas and tends to result in the formation
    of hierarchies of subordinated groups. die deutsche bibliothek
    (german national library) uses mainly narrow catchwords,
    equating this with precise subject classification but
    occasionally deviations from this principle occur. catchwords
    in some subject areas are narrower than in others. terminology
    is carefully controlled and this is essential when precise
    terms are used. if precise subject definition and strict
    terminology control are closely linked then it follows that
    precise subject definition can only be carried out in the
    user's interest when sufficient numbers of well-trained staff
    are available.
