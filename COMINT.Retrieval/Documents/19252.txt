interaction of an electron beam with a fully ionized
    plasma an electron beam modulated at microwave frequency passes
    through a thermal plasma critical frequency cyclotron frequency
    gain in beam modulation amplitude is measured theory is
    outlined which predicts gain for with a maximum at preliminary
    experiments agree with theoretical predictions a measured gain
    at is reported
