studies of externally heated hot cathode arcs the low
    voltage form of the ball of fire mode discussion in terms of a
    model based on the observation that the stream of electrons
    entering the ball plasma from the cathode plasma is scattered
    so completely that the electrons within the ball have a
    maxwellian energy distribution theoretical predictions are
    compared with probe measurements
