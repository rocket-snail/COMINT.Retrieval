the barkhausen effect the only feasible mechanism to
    account for the phenomena associated with the barkhausen effect
    is one in which the movement of a limited section of a domain
    boundary is delayed by a nonmagnetic inclusion whose cross
    sectional dimensions lie within the range hysteresis losses in
    ferromagnetic materials may be reduced by the selective
    reduction of the number of inclusions whose size is within this
    critical range
