catalogues on film. describes chicago public library's
    automation system. in 1974 the library joined the oclc network
    and today all technical departments are automated. the users
    meet automation through the com catalogue (computer output
    microfilm), a system regarded as much cheaper than an on-line
    catalogue. there were many teething troubles involved in the
    initial use of the catalogue, particularly in the branch
    libraries, and the automated acquisition system led to a very
    tight budget control over the branches. although new editions
    of the com catalogue take longer to arrive than promised it has
    led to improved interlending service. the public, however,
    continue to use the old discontinued card catalogue as, it was
    claimed, they are not interested in the library service's total
    holdings, but only in the stock of the library branch used. the
    staff, too, despite lack of organised opposition, expressed
    criticism of the automation programme.
