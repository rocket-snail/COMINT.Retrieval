an assessment of carcinogenicity of n-nitroso compounds
    by the simca method of pattern recognition. the ability to
    predict the toxic responses of potential environmental
    pollutants on the basis of their physicochemical properties has
    many advantages. pattern recognition methods can be used to
    predict such pharmacological properties. the simca method of
    pattern recognition is used to predict the carcinogenicity of
    +n-nitroso compounds, and the advantages of this method of
    pattern recognition in such applications are discussed.
