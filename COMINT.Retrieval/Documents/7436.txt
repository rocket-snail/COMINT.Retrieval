public terminal use in an online catalog: some
    preliminary results. a study of the transaction counts for 2
    1/2 years' activity at the public use terminals of the ohio
    state university libraries' prototype on-line card catalogue to
    determine what search options academic library patrons use the
    most often and whether this pattern varies from that reported
    in major catalogue use studies. the preliminary findings
    indicate significant differences in search strategy that may
    result from a unique user group that prefers to search the
    on-line catalogue, more useful searches in the on-line system,
    or special search patterns imposed by the computer hardware
    itself. both the different searches used by patrons and why
    they chose them should be important factors in the design of
    future on-line catalogues.
