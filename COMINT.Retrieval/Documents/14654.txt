an electronic supply for use in the calibration of
    instruments description of a high power oscillator amplifier
    set with phase shift unit giving an output of at least at unity
    power factor within the range from each of two amplifiers the
    output voltage does not vary by more than during the time taken
    to calibrate point on an instrument scale
