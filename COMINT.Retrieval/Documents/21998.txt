experiences at the control centre of the information
    system on agriculture and food in the german democratic
    republic. 2 types of structural organisation and the
    operational procedures involved in information work are
    described which have proved themselves helpful in the creation
    of an effective information service for the subject areas of
    agriculture, forestry and food economics and their use is
    illustrated with reference to information on milk marketing and
    general cooperation within the system on the economics of
    agriculture and food. it is clear that, through unified as well
    as differential competence relationships of the information
    services involved, through work sharing, specialisation and
    cooperation, an improvement in performance, quality and related
    effectivity can be achieved in the presentation and processing
    of information.
