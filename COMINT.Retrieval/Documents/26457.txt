information science' a bibliometric evaluation of the
    information analysis concept. (phd thesis-boston university
    graduate school.) explores the potential uses of citation
    analysis for the documentation of an interdisciplinary concept
    (information analysis), and in particular the use of citation
    networks to identify the core literature and relationships
    between key parameters. one objective was to demonstrate the
    utility of readily available computer indexing programs to
    perform citation analysis. the study is exploratory and based
    on a small sample. suggests large-scale tests need to be
    conducted using computer-based files and analysis
    procedures.
