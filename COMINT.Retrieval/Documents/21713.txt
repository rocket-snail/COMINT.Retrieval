the relation of cosmic radio emission to the electronic
    component of cosmic rays the similarity between the spectra of
    cosmic rays and of the relativistic electrons responsible for
    cosmic radio waves suggests that the electrons may derive from
    the collisions of primary cosmic rays with the interstellar gas
    the relation to be expected from this process is
    examined
