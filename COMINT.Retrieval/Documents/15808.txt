harmonic distortion and negative feedback an analysis is
    made which takes account of the production of harmonics of
    order higher than the second by the negative feedback process
    the usual formula for the reduction of distortion by
    application of negative feedback is accurate if the slope of
    the amplifier output voltage input voltage curve does not vary
    appreciably over the working range if a valve with a sharp cut
    off is used and the input voltage is greater than the cut off
    value no reduction of distortion can be effected by negative
    feedback
