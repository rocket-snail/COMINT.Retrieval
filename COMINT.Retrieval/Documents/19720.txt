movements of irregularities in the region summer night
    observations of fading patterns of transmissions from three
    broadcasting stations spaced about apart at the vertices of a
    triangle are consistent with large scale movements in the
    region from east to west with velocities of rapid fading with a
    duration of a few hours is considered to be due to scattering
    by clouds showing turbulent velocities of
