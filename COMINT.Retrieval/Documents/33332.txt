a method for sharpening the output waveform of junction
    transistor multivibrator circuits a method of designing the
    circuit to reduce the recharging time of the coupling capacitor
    is given an improvement in waveform at the collector of one
    transistor is achieved with an accompanying deterioration of
    the other output
