automation of a military communication centre. in
    military operations secure communications are required to
    ensure that information is transferred securely, accurately and
    promptly from originator to addressee. message switching
    systems have improved message and data handling, thereby
    reducing transit times to a few minutes; however, within
    communication centres (comcens), messages are still handled
    manually and delays often occur. the solution lies in the
    automation of comcen activities and the provision of direct
    communications with individual users. considers automation in
    terms of present day technology, and analyses the manual
    operational procedures and the functional message flow through
    the comcen to the users.
