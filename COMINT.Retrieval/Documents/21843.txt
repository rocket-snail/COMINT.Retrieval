scattering of electromagnetic waves from a lossy strip on
    a conducting plane an examination is made of the error
    introduced in the analysis of radiation and propagation
    problems by assuming perfect conductivity in media such as the
    ground which are in fact imperfectly conducting the result of
    the approximate calculation is compared with that of an exact
    calculation involving elliptic wave functions for the
    approximation to be permissible the surface impedance o the
    lossy regions should not exceed times the impedance of free
    space
