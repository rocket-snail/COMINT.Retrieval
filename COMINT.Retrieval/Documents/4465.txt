stability in negative feedback time bases the term double
    stroking is applied to a condition in which alternate scanning
    strokes are dissimilar this phenomenon is liable to occur
    during starting and may continue indefinitely in any time base
    where the initiation of flyback depends on the conditions
    existing at the end of the scan and the flyback is maintained
    linear the process is examined in detail for some typical
    circuits
