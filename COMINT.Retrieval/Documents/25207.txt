characteristic energy loss of electrons passing through
    metal foils momentum exciton model of plasma oscillations
    previous work is extended to obtain a unified theory of
    collective and individual electron effects in the excitation of
    a degenerate electron gas by fast incident electrons the theory
    is equivalent to the screening out by the incident
    electrons
