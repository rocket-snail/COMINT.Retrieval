geo morphology of f region ionospheric storms f region
    ionospheric storms may be regarded as manifestations of a
    single world wide phenomenon viz the es field of the solar
    diurnal current system whose local effects depend markedly on
    local time ad a season the theoretical chapman characteristics
    of the f region are normally perturbed by solar tidal electric
    fields of during magnetic storms the phase of the additional
    electric field present is such as to increase these
    perturbations at high latitudes and to reduce them at low
    latitudes though the effect may be masked by local time
    variations of ionization density in contradistinction to
    appleton and piggott of no evidence is found that any magnetic
    storm affects the northern and southern hemispheres differently
    when due allowance is made for the seasonal effect
