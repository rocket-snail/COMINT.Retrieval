electrical and mechanical analogies an introduction to
    the study of general problems concerning electrical networks
    and mechanical systems whose operation is governed by linear
    laws matrix symbolism is explained by examples and a table of
    elementary electrical and mechanical analogues is given
    application of the theory is made to discussion of the
    characteristics of transducers such as loudspeakers and
    piezoelectric or magnetostrictive generators
