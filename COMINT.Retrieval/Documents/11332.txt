frequency discrimination and stabilization of square wave
    modulated microwave transmissions the method described is a
    modification of that due to aurell mit technical report no the
    frequency of the oscillations from a reflex klystron is
    compared with the resonance frequency of a high q cavity and a
    correction voltage depending on the frequency difference is fed
    back to the klystron reflector electrode via the modulator
    where it is combined with the square wave modulation voltage
    the method of alignment of the microwave circuits is discussed
    in detail and the effect of misalignment on the discriminator
    characteristics is shown
