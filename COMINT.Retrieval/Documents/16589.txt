an investigation of whistling atmospherics a
    comprehensive report of an experimental and theoretical study
    of whistling atmospherics at frequencies is given whistlers may
    or may not be preceded by ordinary atmospherics produced by
    lightning strokes at a distance of km the diurnal and annual
    variations of th the properties of both types were investigated
    explanatory theory of their origin advanced by eckersley of is
    developed measurements of the degree of dispersion indicate an
    electron density in the upper atmosphere considerably larger
    than expected this result is explained on the assumption that
    electrons are falling in from outside and this might account
    for the relation between the occurrence of whistlers and
    magnetic activity
