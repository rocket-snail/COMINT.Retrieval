south australian land information system. the south
    australian land information system comprises a series of
    separate but integrated sub-systems of varying degrees of
    automation and encompassing land and property evaluation, land
    taxing, water and sewerage rating, land ownership and tenure,
    mapping, and cadastral coordination. major current developments
    are on-line systems for land ownership and tenure (lots) and
    coordination of allotments (clots). longer term developments
    relate mainly to the closer integration of these 2 and the
    extension of lots towards an automated registration, indexing
    and enquiries system (aries), leading ultimately to a
    computerised land title.
