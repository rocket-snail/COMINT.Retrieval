ferrite attenuators in helixes directional attenuation
    has been observed using a cylinder fitting closely round a
    helix attenuation frequency curves are shown for two values of
    axial magnetic field and attenuation magnetic field curves are
    shown for frequencies of and the directional effect is
    considerably higher than indicated by elementary theory the
    reason for the discrepancy is discussed
