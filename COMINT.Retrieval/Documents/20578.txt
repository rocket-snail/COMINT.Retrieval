with book analyses against morgan kane. the final session
    (nov 79) of a compulsory course for norwegian part-time
    librarians dealt with book knowledge, evaluation and selection.
    based on general novels, it also included high quality and
    popular literature, introducing systematic book analysis and
    professional terminology. assigning novels to genres with the
    aim of supplying alternatives to substandard literature (such
    as morgan kane) was seen as being particularly useful. the art
    of skimming through a book and grasping its essentials was
    practised. study of book reviews revealed that evaluations of
    the same book can differ widely. aids to book selection
    (especially important to rural librarians with no local
    bookshop) were discussed. 2 evening sessions on poetry were
    held. students returned to their libraries with a new interest
    in fiction and good intentions of leading readers, particularly
    teenagers, towards better-quality literature.
