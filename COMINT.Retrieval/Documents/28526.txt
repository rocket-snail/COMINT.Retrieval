a daily index of solar activity based on e layer
    ionization the electron density in a chapman layer can be
    related to the intensity of the incident solar ionizing
    radiation this relation has been adopted as the basis for
    computing a daily index of the radiation intensity using the
    critical frequency of the e layer at slvugh precautions have
    been taken to minimize errors due to irregularities in the
    behaviour of the layer and to the difficulty in identifying the
    e layer cusp the standard deviation of the residual errors in
    the index is estimated to be twv per cent
