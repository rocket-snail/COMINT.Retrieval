public library research. the british library research and
    development department's public library research programme has
    developed rapidly since 1978. projects include state of the art
    reviews, preliminary or enabling studies, evaluation of
    experimental services, and operational research projects. in
    addition, public library projects have been carried out by the
    research centres supported by the department. future work will
    probably concentrate more on dissemination and promotion of
    research results.
