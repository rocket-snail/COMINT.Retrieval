some reflections on citation habits in psychology.
    citations appearing in the pages of a single journal, journal
    of educational psychology, were counted for the years
    1960-1979. the results were compared with those found by using
    networks of journals and with the number of abstracts published
    by psychological abstracts during the same period. in both
    cases the results tend to show that the relationship between
    citation habits and the volume of literature available for
    citing is not very close.
