a comparison of the intensity distribution of radio
    frequency radiation with a model of the galactic system a
    comparison is made between the radiation to be expected from
    objects distributed like the common stars and the observed
    radiation satisfactory agreement with bolton and westfolds
    observations is obtained for the regions where the radiation is
    considerable near the galactic poles and in the hemisphere
    opposite the centre the observed temperatures are about in
    excess of the calculated values this excess is possibly due to
    a background of distant extragalactic nebulae
