guidelines for the development of computer-based
    circulation control systems in university libraries in nigeria.
    (phd thesis-university of pittsburgh). analyses the results of
    a literature review, questionnaire surveys, and interviews and
    concludes that nigerian university library computer-based
    circulation control systems should be developed using an
    integrated systems concept. university computer centre
    facilities should be used rather than commercial bureaux. given
    nigeria's infrastructure, a completely on-line real-time system
    will not be feasible immediately and an intermediate
    off-line/on-line hybrid is suggested.
