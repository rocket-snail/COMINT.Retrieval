on the situation of the public library system in north
    rhine-westphalia. a short report was made on the situation of
    public libraries in north rhine-westphalia (nrw) on 20 aug 80
    at the education committee meeting of the cities' assembly of
    nrw in duisburg. a total of 18 million books are available in
    public libraries in nrw for a population of 17 million. this
    does not compare well with figures of 5, 6 or even 8-10 books
    per head of population in other european countries. the target
    for public libraries in nrw is 2 books per head but even this
    figure will be difficult to achieve in the face of rising book
    costs and a static acquisition budget. although there are
    several new central libraries in the larger towns the library
    service is unevenly distributed and hardly exists at all in
    some country areas. the librarians have put forward suggestions
    for a library law aimed at improving the situation to the
    minister of education.
