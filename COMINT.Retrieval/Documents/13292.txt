network service centers and their expanding role. the
    growth of oclc as an automated library resource-sharing system
    has been made possible in part by intermediary organisations,
    or networks, that function as marketing and distributing agents
    for oclc services. as they have grown, the networks have taken
    on other roles. the results of a survey of the directors of the
    networks reveal patterns of service beyond oclc, and indicate
    that the networks provide, or plan to provide, automated
    library support systems themselves. survey results also reveal
    brokerage of other automated services, networks' revenue
    sources, staff size and growth, and future plans.
