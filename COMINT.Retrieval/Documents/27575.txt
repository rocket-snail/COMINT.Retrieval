nature and origin of sporadic e regions as observed at
    different hours over calcutta typical results of the
    experimental determination of the variation of the reflection
    and transmission coefficients of the e region are shown
    graphically and a statistical study is made of the variation of
    echo amplitude the amplitude distribution of e echoes from a
    thin layer is of the gauss type that from an ion cloud of the
    rayleigh type whilst in general both the steady and the
    scattered reflection components are present to give a rice type
    of distribution of the results of observations made in the
    early morning at sunrise in the z afternoon and during
    thunderstorms are discussed and several ionizing agents are
    suggested
