auger electron emission in the energy spectra of
    secondary electrons from and analysis of the observed energy
    distributions of the secondary electrons for a range of primary
    energies reveals subsidiary maxima at points along the energy
    axis characteristic of the target meterial but independent of
    the primary voltage the positions of these points are
    consistent with an auger process origin for the electrons with
    these energies
