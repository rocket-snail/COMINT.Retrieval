rocket measurements of electron concentration in the
    ionosphere by means of an ultra short wave dispersion
    interferometer investigations have been carried out since at
    heights up to using rockets equipped with transmitters
    operating at and signals were recorded at the ground by two
    different oscillographic methods results indicate that the true
    height of f layer reflections is km lower than the effective
    height recorded by an ionospheric sounder
