do stop this division. comments with regret on the fact
    that danish research libraries, which for 73 years had been
    part of the danish library association (danmarks
    biblioteksforening), felt it necessary in 1978 to form their
    own association (danmarks forskningsbiblioteksforenings) and
    thus causing a split in the danish library system. despite df's
    chairman's conciliatory remarks at db's 75 years' jubilee in
    1980 the national librarian, df's vice chairman, made sharp
    attacks on public libraries, db, the minister for cultural
    affairs and other politicians in his report to df's annual
    meeting 1981. he also attacked the new library bill, although
    this is supported by both the education and the cultural
    ministries. the bill proposes 1 overall administration and a
    directorate for each of the sectors, public and research.
    argues that df should support this unification of the library
    system. db should take the initiative by organising a meeting
    of all parties to discuss a link between the 2 organ
    isations.
