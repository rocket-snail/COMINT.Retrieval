theory of anomalous skin effect an exact expression is
    derived for the surface impedance for the case of arbitrary
    dispersion of conduction electrons assuming an infinitely long
    mean free path the conclusions are the dependence of the
    impedance z on the angle between the normal to the surface and
    the crystallographic axes is determined by tensor the frequency
    dependence of the impedance and the relation between the real
    and imaginary parts of z are independent of the form of the
    dispersion relation the derivation of equation for is
    independent of the interaction of electrons with the lattice
    and hence may be used in the determination of the fermi
    surface
