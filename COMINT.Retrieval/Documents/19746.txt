simultaneous observations of pulsations in the
    geomagnetic field and in ionospheric absorption on and
    september at regular pulsations were recorded simultaneously on
    a riometer operating on a frequency of and a magnetometer
    measuring the h component of the geomagnetic field for many
    cycles the pulsations remain in phase but on occasions they are
    in antiphase the period of the geomagnetic pulsations suggests
    that they are due to toroidal hydromagnetic oscillations of the
    outer atmosphere possible connections with ionospheric
    absorption are briefly considered
