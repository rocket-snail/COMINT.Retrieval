a nonreciprocal microwave component in the presence of a
    steady magnetic field the permeability of a ferrite is an
    asymmetrical tensor this property is applied in the
    construction of a nonreciprocal device comprising a waveguide
    in which a ferrite block is arranged asymmetrically and
    parallel to the axis a static magnetic field being applied
    transversely experimental results are given
