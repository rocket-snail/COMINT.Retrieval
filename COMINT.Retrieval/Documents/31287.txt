light sensitive neon tube circuits the decrease in the
    striking voltage and the slight increase in the dark current
    produced by external illumination in low voltage neon lamps is
    mac made use of in switching lf relaxation oscillator and other
    circuits high power illumination glow lamps may also be
    suitable
