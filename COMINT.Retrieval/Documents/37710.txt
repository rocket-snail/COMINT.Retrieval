formative time lag studies with high frequency discharges
    pulse techniques were used to study phenomena in coaxial
    cylinder and parallel wire systems in the frequency range where
    the discharge changes from corona type to one which completely
    crosses the gap the breakdown voltage drops about above the
    critical frequency
