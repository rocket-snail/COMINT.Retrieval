new trends in librarianship and information science
    studies. the department of librarianship and information
    science at the faculty of philosophy within the comenius
    university in bratislava has been in existence for 30 years. at
    present, both full-time and part-time undergraduate and
    postgraduate courses are offered. in accordance with the new
    ideas in the czechoslovak system of higher education, curricula
    has recently been subjected to profound and sometimes
    controversial changes. the duration of undergraduate courses
    has been reduced from 5 to 4 years. it will concentrate on
    librarianship and/or information science as well as on closely
    related subjects. the aim of equipping students with the basic
    knowledge in the field of their prospective type of library has
    been abandoned. although it fell short of expectations, the
    extension of the department's building will nevertheless enable
    the teaching and other staff to build up resources of
    audio-visual aids and other illustrative materials, and also to
    involve their students in research projects.
