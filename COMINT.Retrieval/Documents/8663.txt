the measurement of term importance in automatic indexing.
    the frequency characteristics of terms in the documents of a
    collection have been used as indicators of term importance for
    content analysis and indexing purposes. in particular, very
    rare or very frequent terms are normally believed to be less
    effective than medium-frequency terms. recently automatic
    indexing theories have been devised that use not only the term
    frequency characteristics but also the relevance properties of
    the terms. the major term-weighting theories are 1st briefly
    reviewed. the term precision and term utility weights that are
    based on the occurrence characteristics of the terms in the
    relevant, as opposed to the nonrelevant, documents of a
    collection are then introduced. methods are suggested for
    estimating the relevance properties of the terms based on their
    overall occurrence characteristics in the collection. finally,
    experimental evaluation results are shown comparing the
    weighting systems using the term relevance properties with the
    more conventional frequency-based methodologies.
