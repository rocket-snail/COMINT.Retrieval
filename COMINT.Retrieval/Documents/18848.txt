moving clouds of ionisation in region e of the ionosphere
    during investigations of the phase path of radio waves returned
    from the e layer of some echoes were observed which came from
    equivalent heights rather less than that of the e layer
    analysis supports the interpretation that the echoes came from
    ionization clouds moving with constant velocity in a horizontal
    direction histograms show tht the velocities ranged between and
    that the most probable duration was and the most probable
    height km echoes can apparently be detected only from clouds la
    lying within a cone of semi angle from the observing point the
    average horizontal dimension of the clouds being about m
