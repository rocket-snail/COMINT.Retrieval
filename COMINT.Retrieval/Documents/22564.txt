scientific and technical information-a pre-condition of
    scientific and technological progress. in czechoslovakia,
    centres of scientific, technical and economic information are
    at present in operation not only in design centres and research
    institutes, but also in all larger factories. the core of such
    a centre is the technical library. in most libraries,
    periodicals and monographs still prevail, but lately patents,
    standards, dissertations, research reports, trade catalogues
    and documentary films are available. the centres' activities
    depend, of course, very much on staff and equipment. building
    up data and documentation bases, under exploration of internal
    and external resources, is of primary importance. translations,
    especially those from foreign languages into slovak and czech
    are also available. information users are taught to use
    information sources more efficiently and effectively. in
    addition to other relevant activities, including their own
    continuing education, information scient ists and other staff
    should engage in theoretical studies and research, the results
    of which should be published wherever possible.
