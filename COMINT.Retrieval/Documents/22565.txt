the loss for business is the library's gain. a portrait
    of vissenbjerg library service, funen, denmark which has
    recently attained full-time status. this was made possible
    through the savings incurred when the library, formerly housed
    in a school, bought space in a shopping centre where many shops
    had had to close. commercial advertising methods were used to
    attract readers. the library is now open 20 hours a week and
    staff has expanded. the development has been helped by the 2.4
    million kr. grant from the library inspectorate, which also
    partly covers running costs during the 1st 3 years. in an
    interview with the librarian, ole hansen, the problems of a
    rapidly growing readership were discussed. he is hopeful that
    acquisitions will keep pace with loans. sees the library as a
    place where democracy is nurtured and where people can meet and
    feel at home. interviews local politicians, who are satisfied
    with the library's location and hope to be able to preserve the
    4 part-time branches. inter views 2 of the part-time
    librarians, who are relieved that the administrative burdens of
    accounting and book selection have been removed from them to
    the main library, but would like to improve services to the
    elderly.
