the nonlinear theory approach to resistance capacitance
    oscillators exact calculations can be made using nonlinear
    theory based on the balance of the reactive power of the
    harmonics involved the analysis indicates that the frequency
    stability when operating near the limit conditions is generally
    better with rc than with cr networks
