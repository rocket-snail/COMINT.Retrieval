theory of the cosmic ray equator the westward shift of
    the cosmic ray equator from the geomagnetic equator is
    explained by assuming that there exist ionized atmospheric
    layers which rotate more slowly than the earth the resultant
    magnetic field beyond the layers is then a dipole field whose
    magnetic north pole is west of the geomagnetic north
    pole
