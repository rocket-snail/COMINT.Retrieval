the very low frequency emissions generated in the earths
    exosphere types of noise other than whistlers have been
    examined using high resolution spectrograms which show the
    frequency distribution as a function of time most of these
    noises are excited in the exosphere by streams or bunches of
    high speed ionized particles trapped in the earths magnetic
    field the excitation mechanism is similar to that of a
    travelling wave valve most of the observations required that
    particle velocities be about kms a model in which the ratio of
    electron density to magnetic field strength is almost constant
    along a line of force in the exosphere seems to be indicated by
    several types of noise
