old bookbinding techniques in modern restoration of
    written material, 6' the construction of globes. the first
    globe of the earth was made at the end of the 15th century;
    globes of the heavens were in existence some time earlier.
    methods of globe manufacture from the 18th century onwards are
    described to illustrate the need for constant improvement.
    globe manufacture frequently involves work by a number of
    different craftsmen. a geographer, mathematician or astronomer
    creates the preliminary design, then a carpenter provides a
    basic wooden structure which is covered with paper paste. the
    map must be cut into sections before being fixed onto the globe
    and then a top layer of lime or chalk is added. an alternative
    manufacturing method is to fill a pottery mould with paper
    mache. pocket globes are often made entirely of wood. a globe
    must be light, easily turned but perfectly balanced.
