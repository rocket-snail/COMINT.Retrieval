profile of a public library. the 5-yearly 2census of
    libraries1, published by the new zealand department of
    statistics, provides so much quantitative information on the
    country's libraries that it is extremely difficult to digest
    and interpret. using the 1974 issue (the most recently
    published), sets out a method of producing a profile (in the
    format of a graph) of a public library, based on 5 factors
    (population served, total book-stock, circulation, number of
    full-time staff, and operating expenditure). this profile
    enables comparisons to be made of the relative performance of
    similar libraries.
