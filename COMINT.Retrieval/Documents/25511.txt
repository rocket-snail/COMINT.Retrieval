librarians and information management in private
    enterprise and government agencies. discusses how the librarian
    can serve the information needs of a specialised type of
    organisation and considers how information is used in
    government and private enterprise, its importance as a
    resource, and what information management involves. the
    librarian accordingly must adapt his skills to the demands of
    the particular environment, where involvement in information
    management and the organisation's operations requires active
    participation in planning activities and operations support.
    suggests how similar organisations could share information
    resources through network cooperation, and illustrates the
    librarian's role in supporting organisation operations. finally
    emphasises the importance of adapting training programmes to
    recognise the kind of demands the librarian will meet in this
    context.
