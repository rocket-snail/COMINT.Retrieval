setting up of a music section: notes on working processes
    in public libraries in czechoslovakia. 1st part of the study
    dealing with the setting up of a music section in a public
    library, entitled 'the library as a dynamic structure',
    indicating several similarities between libraries, biological
    shapes and living processes occurring in nature. it merely
    concerns comparisons (it is not trying to transfer the laws of
    biology into librarianship) and its object is to show-in the
    place of long explanations-the relationships between an
    optimally shaped library collection and continually changing
    influences from the outside world, especially in the world of
    library users.
