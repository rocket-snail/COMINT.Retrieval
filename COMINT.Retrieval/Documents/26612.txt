books and people: the desirability of coordinated
    research. research into reasons why certain sections of the
    population make little use of public libraries will become
    increasingly important in the planning of library policy. in
    the past too much research into library use has served only to
    confirm what was already suspected, that public library users
    belong mainly to the higher income and better educated sections
    of society. in the netherlands the bureau voor de collectieve
    propaganda van het nederlandse boek (office for the joint
    promotion of dutch books) has designated a 'book of the month'
    as a special offer each month since 1970. a new organisation
    should be created in the netherlands with representatives from
    the publishing houses, all sections of the library world and
    from government departments to investigate ways of stimulating,
    coordinating and subsidising the nation's reading
    habits.
