the work market. argues for the development of
    librarianship training programmes that will truly prepare the
    professional to meet the needs of a work market determined, in
    brazil, by the social conditions of economic development. there
    is now an increasing demand for librarians, but library schools
    do not gear their programmes to provide training for actual
    social situations. once the nature of the market needs is
    understood, training policies can be adapted accordingly.
    illustrates the argument with reference to the public library
    and university library fields, emphasising the necessity for
    practical abilities and professional awareness.
