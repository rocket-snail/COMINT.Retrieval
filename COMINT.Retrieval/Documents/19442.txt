some possible relations between the nightglow and the
    ionosphere ionospheric data from stanford california are
    compared with nightglow data from cactus peak california the
    nocturnal variation of the brightness of the green line of is
    found to be similar to the variation of height of thd f region
    the nocturnal variation of the brightness of the red lines of
    is found to be similar to that of the electron density of the f
    region the possibility that the red lines are produced by
    radiation following dissociative recombination of electrons
    with o ions is discussed paper presented at the assembly of the
    union geodesique et geophysique internationale rome
