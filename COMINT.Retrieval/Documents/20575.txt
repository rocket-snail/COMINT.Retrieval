a unifying theory of high latitude geophysical phenomena
    and geomagnetic storms a convection system set up in the
    magnetosphere by viscous interaction between the magnetosphere
    and a solar wind or by other sources could account for a wide
    variety of observed high latitude geophysical phenomena and
    storm time variations
