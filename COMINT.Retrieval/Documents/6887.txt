preventing public sex in library settings. public
    libraries attract subscribers who use the library in both
    legitimate and illegitimate ways. one group of individuals
    using the library for unconventional purposes are public
    eroticists who use the toilets and other accessible areas for
    sexual purposes. rather than consumer security time in trying
    to entrap and/or arrest these individuals, it is suggested that
    changing security functioning and goals and a few minor
    structural changes will discourage most if not all such
    behaviour.
