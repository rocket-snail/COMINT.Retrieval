some circuit considerations of the transistor a detailed
    discussion of the single stage transistor amplifier and in
    particular of the unity coupler condition stability criteria
    are also discussed since four useful varieties of a single
    stage amplifier exist a two stage amplifier can take different
    forms these are divided into four groups high power gain low
    terminating resistance high terminating resistance and
    bilateral type the latter is an emitter base base emitter
    circuit and is suitable for obtaining high gains
