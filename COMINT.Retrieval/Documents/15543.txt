two new equations for the design of filters equations are
    presented for designing constant k configuration filters with
    tchebycheff type characteristics for the case when the unloaded
    q of the elements is sufficiently high for them to be
    considered nondissipative both band pass and low pass filters
    are considered the band pass examples are mainly for uhf
