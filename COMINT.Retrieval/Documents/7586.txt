the effect of relaxation on microwave measurements of the
    anomalous skin effect the ratio of the conductivity to the mean
    free path of an electron in bi t microwave frequencies
    estimated on on the basis of dingles theory is compared with
    given earlier by pippard and chambers neglecting relaxation
    effects this discrepancy and the discrepancy for normal metals
    are discussed
