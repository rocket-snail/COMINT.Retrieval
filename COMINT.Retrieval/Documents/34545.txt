thirty years of the 2bibliotekar1. a critical evaluation
    of almost 30 years of 2bibliotekar's 1history. inadequate
    financial resources have meant that authors fees are not
    generous, and the quality of the published material suffers. it
    is also impossible to improve the journal's layout, although
    the printing facilities at the cyril and methodius national
    library are gratefully appreciated. certain suggestions should
    improve 2bibliotekar's 1quality and image, e.g. articles should
    be planned well in advance by the cyril and methodius national
    library and other major libraries. freelance correspondents all
    over the country should report regularly about libraries in
    their regions. other freelance collaborators, with a good
    command of modern languages, should provide reviews of foreign
    periodicals on librarianship and designate articles worthy of
    full translation into bulgarian. a special commission should be
    appointed to specify 2bibliotekar's1 statute which would
    strengthen its position as the only journal catering for all
    types of librarians in bulgaria.
