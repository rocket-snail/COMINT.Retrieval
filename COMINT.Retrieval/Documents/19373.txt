oscillations of a plasma beam in a magnetic field at
    frequencies close to the cyclotron frequency a method is
    described by which plasma oscillations have been observed in
    hydrogen at frequencies lower than the ion cyclotron
    frequencies the absorption of r f power by ions which rotate in
    the magnetic field is detected by the change in q of an
    oscillator circuit
