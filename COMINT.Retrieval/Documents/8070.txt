effects of the earths oblateness on the orbit of an
    artificial satellite a mathematical analysis of the
    perturbations of the radius vector the displacement of the
    nodal and apsidal lines and the variation of the inclination
    with latitude a rigorous solution to the second order
    differential equation is given for an equatorial orbit taking
    account of the first order effects of the earth oblateness some
    second order effects on the equatorial orbit and the
    relativistic effect of the apsidal line displacement are
    considered
