noise in u h f amplifiers general noise effects in u h f
    amplifiers of any type are considered relations between the
    noise parameters are established using the method of the
    transfer of the current generators proposed previously general
    expressions for the noise factors are derived and the minimum
    number of noise parameters required to characterize a circuit
    is deter mined a concept of partial noise parameters is
    introduced
