switching in bistable circuits all triggering processes
    seem capable of description in terms of a curve with a region
    of negative slope points on this curve representing unstable
    states while points on a s positive slope represent stable
    states a negative resistance circuit in which the voltage is a
    multiple valued function of current was constructed so that
    details of the triggering process could be observed on an
    oscilloscope screen by suitable periodic sampling a slow motion
    representation of the transition between two states is
    obtained
