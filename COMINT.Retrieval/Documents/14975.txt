long life contacts for unidirectional currents of amperes
    an experimental investigation was made of fundamental physical
    phenomena concerned in the operation of contacts in vibratory
    converters the influence of voltage and current on the
    direction of migration of material was studied long life was
    obtainable with pt contacts or with contacts of dissimilar
    metals but on heavy duty an adequate life was obtained only
    with w contacts in a low oxygen atmosphere
