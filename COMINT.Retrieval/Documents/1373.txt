density fluctuations in a plasma in a magnetic field with
    applications to the ionosphere general expressions are derived
    for the fluctuations in density of electrons ions and net
    charge in a plasma in thermal equilibrium in an external
    magnetic field coulomb interaction and two body collisions are
    taken into account the total scattered power and doppler
    spectrum is calculated for incoherent scatter from the
    ionosphere at with a radar at mcs the total power is unaffected
    by the magnetic field but resonance peaks at multiples of the
    ion gyro frequency appear in the spectrum when the radar beam
    is within of orthogonality with the field lines
