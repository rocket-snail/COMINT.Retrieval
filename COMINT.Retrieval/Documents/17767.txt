display technologies for office systems. considers the
    requirements for an ideal office display and compares crt
    (cathode ray tubes) with matrix displays to see how closely
    they can meet requirements. the crt can meet the display
    function requirements but is not ideal in space taken, power
    and weight. no other display technology can meet the range of
    function required but they have attractions in size and shape
    and as technologies improve may meet the functional
    requirements.
