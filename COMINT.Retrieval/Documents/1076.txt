research report on an overview of a proposal monitoring
    facility for the large-scale, network-based oclc on-line
    system. addresses the critical importance of measuring and
    evaluating information systems functioning within computer
    network environments. the focus is on the significant benefits
    associated with using automated monitoring as the primary
    information system measurement mechanism within such computing
    architectures. the large scale, network-based, state-of-the-art
    oclc on-line system is utilised as the information system
    environment in support of these research and development
    activities. report not available from ntis.
