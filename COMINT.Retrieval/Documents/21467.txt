user satisfaction in the hugh stephens college library. a
    user survey was conducted at the hugh stephens college library
    to determine the degree of user satisfaction and identify
    limiting factors. analysis of data from 203 data sheets
    completed by patrons requesting specific titles reveals that
    acquisitions by the library and user error are more significant
    limiting factors in this library than either circulation or
    library error. it is recommended that further study be made of
    the extent of use of the holdings of other libraries, and of
    the proportion of users who come to browse or search by subject
    rather than specific title, before changing acquisitions
    policy. a significant proportion of user error indicates a lack
    of adequate library searching techniques, and it is suggested
    that assistance be provided for potential users through such
    means as library orientation programmes and signs alerting them
    to commonly committed errors of the location of special
    collections. report not availabl e from ntis.
