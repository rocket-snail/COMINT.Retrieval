paramagnetic resonance along the direction of the
    polarizing field a radio frequency susceptibility along the
    polarizing field is observed when the electron spin resonance
    of dpph is partly saturated at microwave frequency the
    variations of the real and imaginary parts as a function of the
    radio frequency have been studied theoretical calculations are
    in good agreement with experiment in some cases a negative
    susceptibility appears which has been used in a molecular
    amplifier experiment
