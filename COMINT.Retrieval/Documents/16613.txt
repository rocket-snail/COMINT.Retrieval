the diffusion of moisture in electrical capacitors and
    their insulation resistance the laws of moisture diffusion are
    derived mathematically and investigated experimentally on paper
    capacitors the effect of moisture on the insulation resistance
    of the dielectric is calculated and comparison is made with
    measurements on plastic covered capacitors stored under
    conditions of high humidity
