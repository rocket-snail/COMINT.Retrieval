application of complex symbolism to linear variable
    networks the theory developed is based on frequency domain
    analysis equations are derived for networks containing one
    linear variable element the value of which varies periodically
    and is capable of being developed in a fourier series the
    usefulness of these equations for computations of magnetic and
    dielectric modulators and amplifiers is indicated
