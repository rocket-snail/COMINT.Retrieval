on the cherenkov radiation of an electron moving in a
    medium with spatial dispersion an examination of the cherenkov
    radiation in an isotropic medium including a consideration of
    spatial dispersion the angular distribution of the radiation
    intensity and the escape of the radiation through the surface
    of the medium are discussed
