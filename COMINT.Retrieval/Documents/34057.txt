the possible importance of nitric oxide formation during
    polar cap ionospheric absorption events polar cap absorption is
    attributed to an increase in abundance of the probable
    ionizable constituent of the d region a possible mechanism
    depends on the production of n atoms by cosmic ray particles
    the ionization of must occur above alternative theories of
    polar cap absorption involving photodetachment of electrons
    from ions require the ionization to be much lower
