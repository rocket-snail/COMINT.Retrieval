user and librarian in conversation, pt. 1. an
    investigation was carried out into the behaviour of individual
    librarians when handling readers' enquiries in the adult
    lending department of neubrandenberg municipal and district
    library, with the intention of assessing the user-staff
    relationship in the context of social communication. checks
    were made on the frequency of users' visits during different
    periods of the day to see whether the librarian had sufficient
    time for advisory work, which was in fact the case for about
    80% of the time. it is difficult but necessary to make a
    quantitative analysis of this type of work in order to make a
    comparison of results.
