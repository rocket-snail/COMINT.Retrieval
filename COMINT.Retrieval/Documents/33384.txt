correlation between photons in two coherent beams of
    light principles used in the radio interferometer described
    previously are applicable to the measurement of the angular
    diameter of visual stars if the two aerials are replaced by
    mirrors and the detectors by photocells for operation of such a
    system it is essential that the time of arrival of photons at
    the two photocathodes should be correlated when the light beams
    incident on the two mirrors are coherent a laboratory
    experiment demonstrating the existence of this effect is
    described
