a reviewer's story. paper presented at the 41st
    conference of the graduate library school, university of
    chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access to services and
    materials in school and public libraries. a reviewer looks at
    selection, description, and criticism of the children's books
    which she must decide to recommend or not recommend for library
    purchase. woven throughout the discussion is a personalised
    account of experiences that force the reviewer to consider the
    whole range of possible reactions to controversial material
    from viewpoints of children, parents, librarians, educators,
    publishers, authors, and artists. in addition to the nature of
    the book and the prospective reader the reviewer needs to take
    into account her own preparation and experience for evaluating
    and reviewing each book.
