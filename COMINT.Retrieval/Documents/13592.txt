    (+s+e+e 82/573). the publishing of the library for talking
    books and braille (tpb) is very important for the supply of
    talking books. 1200 titles annually are produced for loan in
    libraries, of which the tpb accounts for 900. the selection of
    books includes all easy readers and 25% of production are books
    for children and young people. the aged form the largest user
    group. braille books are now in a minority; they are lent
    directly to readers. catalogues of the tpb's stock and new
    acquisitions are being prepared using the bums data base. some
    books for immigrants are available. as a loan centre the tpb is
    obliged to lend to different institutions and collate
    information on local library stocks. it aims to develop the
    decentralisation of talking book provision and therefore wishes
    to transfer to the local public library the responsibility for
    direct lending to individuals and purchase of an adequate stock
    from the library service.
