on the propagation of whistling atmospherics it is shown
    that the dispersion of whistling atmospherics propagated along
    the lines of force of the earths magnetic field should be
    greatly dependent on the geomagnetic latitude of the observing
    point the change in the magnetic field intensity along a line
    of force produces an upper frequency limit for whistler
    propagation which at latitudes greater than should fall within
    he usually observed frequency region of dispersion curves
    showing this critical frequency are given for geomagnetic
    latitudes and
