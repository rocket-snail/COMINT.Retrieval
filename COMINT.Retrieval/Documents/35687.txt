information obtained from ionization charts ionization
    charts drawn up monthly for two zones covering america and
    europe africa and asia are discussed the distributions observed
    generally confirm the theory of geomagnetic control of the f
    layer of appleton but some exceptions are observed there
    appears to be a lower limiting value for the height of the sun
    below which the geomagnetic control does not operate the
    control is effective at latitudes as high as measurements at
    other times besides midday are required to study the effect
    asymmetry as between northern and southern hemispheres is
    observed the north polar zone was studied in detail the auroral
    e zone appears to be centred on the geographic pole
