using hall generators as contactless commutators a
    sampling rate in excess of is achieved by feeding a signal
    voltage into one input of a hall generator and a switching
    waveform into the other amplification must be used to recover
    the signal loss but only one amplifier is needed regardless of
    the number of inputs
