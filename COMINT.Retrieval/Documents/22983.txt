parametric energy conversion in distributed systems
    analysis of most types of travelling wave parametric amplifier
    with little or no dispersion shows that no exponential
    amplification at the fundamental frequency of an applied signal
    is possible although the total n energy increases with distance
    it is spread among a large number of frequency cross products
    for the beam type system amplification of the fundamental
    component may become possible as dispersion increases but a
    more detailed analysis is required
