technology, organisation and society. discusses the
    implications to be drawn from recent literature on' the issues
    facing organisations in an age of fast technical change; the
    impact of information-processing technology generally, on the
    shop-floor, and in the office; and the impact of
    micro-electronics and micro-chip on wider issues of employment
    and social change. concludes that it is difficult to
    disentangle the many strands of the change process and that
    recent speculative literature (and television documentaries)
    are no substitute for serious longer-term research.
