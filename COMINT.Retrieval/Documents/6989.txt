sewsaw maser operation cross relaxation between adjacent
    intervals may be used to secure an advantage in maser operation
    comparable to that obtained by push pull pumping equations for
    the rate of change of populations in a scheme of four levels
    when ac is pumped and cross relaxation takes place bt between
    have been formulated and the steady state condition
    corresponding to various assumptions regarding lattice
    relaxation times is discussed in an experimental investigation
    of maser operation based on this scheme and using ruby as the
    active material an inversion of was obtained at a signal
    frequency of when pumping at
