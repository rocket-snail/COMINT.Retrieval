studies of the atmospheric potential gradient no examples
    of atmospheric electrical phenomena in foggy conditions from an
    examination of numerous records of the atmospheric electric
    field and the vertical current obtained at stations in lowland
    and mountainous regions during fog several types of
    characteristic reaction are distinguished these are discussed
    in detail
