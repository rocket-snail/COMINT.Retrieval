interaction of centimetre waves with plasma in the
    presence of a magnetic field experimental evidence of self
    interaction was sought using an wave of frequency in a circular
    waveguide containing a continuous discharge parallel to the
    direction of propagation and a transverse magnetic field
    absorption was observed passing through a maximum at the field
    strength value corresponding to the gyrofrequency an expression
    for the modulation depth is derived in terms of carrier
    frequency gyrofrequency and modulation frequency the term self
    interaction is preferred to self demodulation since the
    modulation depth may be either increased or decreased depending
    on the circumstances further experiments were made by
    transmitting an unmodulated wave through a plasma oscillating
    at low frequency in a eon tube of length the wave became
    strongly modulated the form of the wave envelope was modified
    greatly by application of a magnetic field while the modulation
    disappeared completely at the field strength corresponding to
    gyromagnetic resonance
