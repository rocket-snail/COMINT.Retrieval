libraries and botanical gardens. suggests that botanical
    gardens should be divided into 3 parts' the living collection,
    the dried collection and the library. briefly describes the
    sterling morton library at the morton arboretum, chicago and
    deplores the breaking up and selling off of some major
    botanical gardens in europe and new york. also stresses that a
    library is more than a collection of books-it is a selection
    for a purpose, chosen with care and should not be completely
    replaced by electronic media.
