the resistivity of composition resistors at radio
    frequencies continuation of the previous discussion of the
    mechanism causing the drop of resistance of composition
    resistors at experimentally obtained resistance frequency
    curves are presented for resistors comprising a cylindrical
    column of an aqueous solution of sodium chloride a cylindrical
    column of an aqueous solution of copper sulphate and a
    cylindrical column of carbon resin composition the resistance
    of type is practically constant at frequencies up to while that
    of types and drops considerably the drop in the resistance of
    the composition resistor is ascribed partly to the resistivity
    factor and partly to the external capacitance factor it is
    suggested that a frequency independent resistor could be
    obtained by mixing carbon with a material of high dielectric
    constant
