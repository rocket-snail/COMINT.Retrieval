changing patterns of information use in planning. 2
    studies conducted over a period of 10 years revealed a number
    of consistencies in the use of information in planning, both as
    far as the demand for information is concerned and the problems
    involved in utilisation of existing sources on the supply side.
    developments that have occurred over that period reflect the
    considerable number of improvements of both advisory and
    statutory nature. these result in a more comprehensive
    systems-wide approach and an increased awareness of the role of
    improved information bases. further improvements are still
    desirable, however, notably in the form of improved linkages
    and continued dissemination of experience whether positive or
    negative.
