theory of thin aerials in cavity resonators free
    oscillations in a cavity resonator containing thin metallic
    aerials or having narrow slot in its walls are considered
    formulae are derived for the natural frequency and
    eigenfunctions of such a system and for the decrement and of
    the resonator the results are used in a discussion of the
    excitation of a cavity resonator by thin aerials the problem is
    reduced to the excitation of the resonator by given external
    electric or magnetic currents several examples are considered
    in detail the analysis is continued in the following paper both
    tuned and untuned aerials are considered
