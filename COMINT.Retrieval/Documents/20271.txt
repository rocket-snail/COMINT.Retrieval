preliminary evaluation of a selective dissemination of
    information service in an agriculture library. describes the
    organisation and operation of a small scale manual current
    awareness service at a brazilian agriculture library,
    biblioteca estadual de agricultura do parana. the service was
    limited to periodicals over a 1 year period. details are given
    of procedures for constructing user profiles, analysis of
    literature, and notification. to date, relevance is about 70%,
    but an initial lack of cooperation from users makes accurate
    assessment difficult. a study of periodical usage is being
    planned.
