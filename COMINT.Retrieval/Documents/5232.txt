the transbooster description of circuits in which a
    transductor is used for regulation of the output voltage of a
    rectifier fed from ac mains under varying load conditions if
    the transductor is connected on the dc side of the main
    rectifier a smaller transductor can be used since it will only
    have to handle the total boost voltage required to cover
    rectifier regulation and mains voltage variation
