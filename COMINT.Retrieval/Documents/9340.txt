ionospheric observations during the solar eclipse of
    strong ionization prevented the accurate observation of but was
    reliable and assuming complete cut off of the ionizing
    radiation at totality gave the layer data are consistent with a
    solar model in which and of the radiation was emitted from
    areas near the west and east limbs respectively originated in
    an undefined area which may cover the greater part of the suns
    disk the changes in indicate a marked solar control of the
    layer and assuming a recombination law give measurements
    absorption are consistent with the solar model deduced from the
    layer data and give a theoretical treatment is given of the
    eclipse changes in the region
