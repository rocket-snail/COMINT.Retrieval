a nines complement decade counter with recorder a brief
    outline of decimal counting using weighted binary digits is
    given with special reference to systems giving complements of
    nine a binary decade electronic counter arranged so as to allow
    the reading of nines complements which may be used to represent
    negative numbers is then described in the circuit arrangement
    used in this counter the maximum counting rate remains the same
    as that of a simple binary counter recording of the number
    counted is made on teledeltos paper the record and counter
    reset being carried out simultaneously
