characteristics of an elliptical electromagnetic resonant
    cavity operating in the te mode equations and graphs are
    presented of the resonant wavelength and quality factor of
    elliptical resonant cavities operating in the te mode both
    components of this mode are treated and distinctive
    characteristics of each are shown as a function of eccentricity
    of the cavity
