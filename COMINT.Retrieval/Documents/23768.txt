unified rules on keyword cataloguing. lecture given at
    the annual conference of the verein der bibliothekare an
    offentlichen bibliotheken (association of librarians in public
    libraries) west germany, may 81. librarians have been
    discussing the idea of unified keyword cataloguing rules for
    over 50 years and the subject cataloguing committee of the
    deutsches bibliotheksinstitut (german library institute) has
    recently produced a report on this subject. since subject
    cataloguing problems have been neglected for decades and
    subject cataloguing carried out by many individual libraries
    has resulted in the wasting of work time, super-regional
    cooperation in this sphere offers attractive prospects. if
    regional union catalogue systems and centralised services took
    over all subject cataloguing, rational rules and procedures
    would result. keyword catalogues are becoming more and more
    popular and the creation of unified rules will demand more
    intensive work by librarians.
