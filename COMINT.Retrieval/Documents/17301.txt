some techniques for network synthesis the synthesis of
    immittances with two poles and two zeros is discussed cauers
    continued fraction technique is generalized for use in
    realizing rlc network immittances design procedure is developed
    for a constant resistance ladder this nt network is shown to
    have the same field of application as the conventional rlc
    constant resistance bridge t but has the advantages of greater
    flexibility and less complexity complicated transfer functions
    may be realized in a chain of ladder sections having arm
    immittances with only two poles and two zeros
