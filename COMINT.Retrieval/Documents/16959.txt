the provision of literature for public libraries and
    trade union libraries. in east germany, an important
    partnership has developed between libraries and the
    zentralinstitut fur bibliothekswesen (zib-central institute of
    librarianship), which provides information on published
    literature. present problems include out of print material and
    the inability of local booksellers to provide all requirements.
    it is assumed that all libraries buy the popular material
    recommended by zib, although only large libraries buy the more
    advanced works, especially on science and technology. an
    agreement has been made between publishers and zib concerning
    the centralising of library supplies. zib's lists of
    recommended books, periodicals, newspapers, tapes and records
    are an important basis for purchasing policy; each library
    should have 1 staff member responsible for dealing with
    them.
