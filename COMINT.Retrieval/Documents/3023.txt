collecting sensitive data anonymously: further findings
    on the cdrgp technique. describes a confidentiality-preserving
    data collection method called the context-determined,
    rule-generated, pseudonym (cdrgp) technique, a specifically
    constructed set of questions based upon personal information
    known to the respondent (but to few others) which each
    respondent answers whenever data are gathered: the respondent's
    answers to the questions generate a probabilistically unique
    string of letters, or code identifier, that allows the data
    being collected to be tied to previously collected data. report
