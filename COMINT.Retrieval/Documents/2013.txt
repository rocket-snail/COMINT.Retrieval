nonlinear distortion in transistor amplifiers following
    an analysis of the causes of distortion in common emitter
    circuits the distortion factor is derived from the static
    characteristics the dependence of distortion on temperature
    collector bias input signal level and load resistance is
    determined and calculated values are compared with results of
    measurements
