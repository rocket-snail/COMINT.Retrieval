a problem of information retrieval system control and
    principles of solving problems of evaluation. discusses those
    information retrieval system evaluation problems which are
    connected with systems control; proposes an approach to their
    solution; formulates the main principles of the approach; and
    presents a method of isolating evaluation problem classes with
    similar solution models.
