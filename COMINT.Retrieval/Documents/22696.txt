assistant librarians in university libraries-assistants
    in libraries. a comparison. there are many problems connected
    with the career structures of assistant librarians in
    university libraries and assistants in libraries in west
    germany. the problems arise with careers training; this differs
    from 1 federal state to the next, entrance requirements are not
    standardised nor are the syllabuses or final examinations. the
    type of educational institute providing training also varies
    from state to state and may be a library college, a training
    library or a polytechnic. there is no clearly defined career
    structure for assistant librarians or assistants which causes
    difficulties within libraries when allocating duties and
    difficulties in salary grades. it is necessary to aim at a
    joint careers training scheme for both assistant librarians and
    library assistants but before this can be achieved the above
    mentioned problems must be settled.
