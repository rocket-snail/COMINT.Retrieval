the behaviour of the lower ionosphere near sunrise in the
    lower d region a temporary increase in electron density is
    predicted at the time of ionospheric sunrise a decrease in the
    height of reflection of clf waves and a decrease in the signal
    strength of waves at sunrise are quoted as evidence for the
    existence of the temporary layer
