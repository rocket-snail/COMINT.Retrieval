the individual and collective reader. the russian people
    evince a growing demand for books. but where will the paper for
    multi-million editions come from? transition to an urban life
    style has led to a greater demand for books. many, who are new
    to book culture, consider books as proud possessions, not for
    use. the demand for books is beginning to resemble that for the
    mass media. bestsellers exacerbate libraries' problem
    situation. bestseller texts should in future be translated to
    another information carrier and be disseminated by libraries or
    the trade. homes and libraries will still need those books that
    are intended for the individual reader.
