use of slow molecules in molecular generators methods of
    improving the absolute frequency stability of a beam type maser
    are considered based on the use of molecular beams with mean
    velocities much less than the thermal velocity at room
    temperature three techniques are described removal of high
    velocity molecules from the beam retardation of the molecules
    by an external field reduction of the temperature of the
    molecular beam
