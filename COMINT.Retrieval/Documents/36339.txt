plasma oscillations at extremely high frequencies the
    analysis presented is applicable to plasmas in impurity
    semiconductors as well as those in gas discharges the design of
    generators based on standing waves in such plasmas is
    considered electron densities of the order of are required in a
    system discussed an electron beam is shot into the plasma which
    is confined between two parallel reflecting surfaces these may
    be the faces of a wafer of semiconductor whose thickness
    determines the natural oscillation frequency problems
    introduced by the slowing up of the electron beam in such a
    system are indicated
