the philosophy of recording knowledge. although much has
    been said about how mankind has recorded knowledge, the
    question of why record knowledge at all has not been treated
    systematically. inferences and deductions from historical
    recording formats lead to the conclusion that while technology
    has advanced the art of record keeping, the underlying purposes
    have remained essentially the same-to commemorate, communicate,
    pray, calculate, measure, and preserve.
