the darc substructure search system a searcher's
    experience. the search questions of the chemist often relate to
    a class of substances (i.e. he desires information on all
    individual compounds which have particular partial structures
    in common). in darc, an effective search programme is available
    which allows these compounds to be sought out from a very large
    fund of structures (4.5 million) and the structure diagram of
    each compound with the associated registry number to be
    represented on the screen of a graphic display terminal. it is
    possible, in addition, to use the result of this search, in the
    form of a list of registry numbers, as search parameters in a
    bibliographic file, if necessary in combination with
    non-structural information.
