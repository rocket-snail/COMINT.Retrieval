the aims of mobile library services. during the last 13
    years of the 20 years' existence of mobile library service in
    finland this service has become of considerable importance.
    there is a mobile library standard and the finnish library
    association has set up a mobile library working group. training
    of drivers has been neglected although they deal with the bulk
    of the loans. the mobiles, until the introduction of the
    standard, were uncomfortable and wasteful in energy, and had a
    short life. this year 4.5 million f marks will be spent on new
    mobiles by about 12 local authorities. 40 authorities have
    applied for a grant. the following aspects of a mobile service
    need developing: improved services and their rationalisation,
    training of drivers, cooperative purchase of mobiles by 2 or
    more authorities.
