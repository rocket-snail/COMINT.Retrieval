formative time lags in the electrical breakdown of gases
    the time rate of growth of ionization currents in a uniform
    field greater than that corresponding to the static sparking
    potential is investigated theoretically curves showing the
    dependence of the formative time lag on overvoltage are given
    with an example of their use in the elucidation of secondary
    ionization processes operative in the breakdown
    mechanism
