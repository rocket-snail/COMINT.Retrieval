in the shadow of the black krone. reports on the swedish
    library association's annual meeting in kiruna, june 81.
    libraries were accused of fixating on loan figures and
    neglecting quality. protests against cuts in library
    expenditure and calls for a library law have come from
    publishers, authors and trade unions, as well as librarians.
    but the public library commission's remit does not include
    proposals for a law, nor may it recommend action which involves
    further expenditure. it is foremost an examination of the
    status quo. it hopes to draw on the findings of the dala
    project, a literature campaign starting in autumn 81. an
    account of the videogram commission's work was given; stress
    was laid on the positive aspects of video, such as greater
    availability of rare and unpopular films and aids for
    minorities. a distribution network for serious video production
    involving libraries was called for. a resolution against the
    introduction of lending fees and for a library law was rejected
    as unani mity among representatives was lacking.
