assessing effectiveness. a preliminary study to probe the
    views of librarians, relating to the role of evaluation and the
    assessment of effectiveness. interviews were conducted in a 10%
    sample of library authorities in england in sept 79-may 80.
    opinions were sought from chief librarians, research and
    development officers and senior management. a workshop was set
    up to further explore the levels of understanding of and
    commitment to the use of evaluative techniques applied to
    library performance. 2 detailed checklists relating to
    effectiveness and evaluative design were generated and used as
    a basis for the work. the need for guidance on terminology and
    direction on methods was clearly established but was deemed
    likely to be ineffective if imposed by agencies external to
    library systems.
