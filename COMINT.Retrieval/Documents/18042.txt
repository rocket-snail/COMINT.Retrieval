pulse generator with variable repetition frequency and
    pulse width an instrument designed around the eq nonode valve
    is described the principle of operation is that of the detector
    of the pulse repetition frequency can be varied between and or
    higher the duty factor from to and the amplitude from to the
    pulse flank occupies of the pulse period pam pwm and pphm can
    be used a complete circuit diagram including component values
    is given
