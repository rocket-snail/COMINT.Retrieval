matrix reduction using the hungarian method for the
    generation of school timetables the application of kuhn's
    hungarian method to the problem of matrix reduction as needed
    in gotlieb's method for timetable generation is described. the
    method is suited to both hand and computer calculation. devices
    to improve the efficiency of the basic algorithm are discussed.
