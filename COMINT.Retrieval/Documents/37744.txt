attraction of new readers by central regional and other
    public libraries. at present libraries in bulgaria, as
    elsewhere, have to compete with mass media, in particular with
    television. migration of young people to towns hampers
    expansion of libraries in rural areas. people buy more books
    and use public libraries less than in the past. in spite of
    this as well as some other negative factors, interest in
    reading has increased recently and the population's leisure
    time activities have become more balanced. thus the staff in
    local public and central regional libraries have to plan
    carefully to attract new readers. all ages and social groups
    must be catered for. in addition to books, special printed
    material, such as sheet-music and reproduction of paintings,
    must be more fully used.
