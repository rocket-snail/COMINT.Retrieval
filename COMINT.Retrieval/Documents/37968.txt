outline of a society of freely available information.
    today technological innovations in many fields cause social
    changes almost before society has become aware of their
    existence. very often negative influences of certain
    innovations have not been thoroughly investigated beforehand.
    this has led to the growth of many counter movements in
    society. it is necessary to find common ground between
    representatives of 'established' and 'alternative' styles of
    living, in order to ensure the continuation of innovation in
    society. initiative, creativity and cooperation, the vital
    factors for technological and economic innovation, are evident
    in both groups, only opinions as to the best means of employing
    them differ. today a new electronic information network is
    gradually linking mankind. the world is becoming a 'global
    village' at least on the level of technological communications
    structures. this network may enable us to progress to a
    rational world model in which everyone will have a chance in
    life.
