measurement of the cosmic ray intensity in the
    stratosphere at various heights and latitudes investigation of
    the altitude dependence of particles of the cosmic ray soft
    component in the latitude range to results indicate that at a
    latitude or the majority of particles of soft components are
    electrons generated by mesons at latitude an excess of
    electrons is found possessing energies vekiw cn expressions are
    derived for the primary particle energy spectrum at latitude
    the primary cosmic ray particle flux has been found equal to
