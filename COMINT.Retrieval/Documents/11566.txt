the influence of the surface states of electrons on the
    optical properties of semiconductors and dielectrics the
    reflection of em waves from a plane surface with electronic
    surface conduction is considered for incidence angles close to
    reflection increases with the angle when the electric vector is
    parallel to the surface but decreases when the electric vector
    is almost perpendicular to the surface
