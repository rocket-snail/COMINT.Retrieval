dual pricing of health sciences periodicals' a survey. a
    survey of dual pricing practices among publishers of
    health-related journals identified 281 periodicals with an
    average price differential of over 100% between individual and
    institutional subscription rates. both the practice itself and
    the amount of the differential are increasing, indicating that
    journal subscriptions of health sciences libraries increasingly
    provide the necessary financial support for the publication of
    health sciences journals. dual pricing is also correlated with
    copyright royalties. problems created for health sciences
    libraries' budgets by dual pricing are partly due to uncritical
    purchasing by libraries. recommends increased consumerism on
    the part of health science librarians.
