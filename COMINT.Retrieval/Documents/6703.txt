precision variable capacitors for high grade electronic
    equipment two types of small variable capacitor are described
    which were designed to meet stability and accuracy
    specifications comparable with larger types one gives a linear
    frequency variation over of shaft rotation the other gives a
    sinusoidal variation of frequency about a mean value as the
    rotor shaft is turned continuously
