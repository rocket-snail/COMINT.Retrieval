method for elimination of effect of stray capacitances in
    the production and amplification of step voltages discussion is
    presented of the charge and discharge mechanism of a
    multivibrator circuit to obtain a steep leading pulse flank a
    rapid discharge of the negative charge accumulated at one of
    the anodes is necessary this is achieved by using the anode
    dynode path of an auxiliary secondary emission valve pulses of
    amplitude up to with flanks of slope about sec were obtained
    application of the principle in frequency dividers is also
    described
