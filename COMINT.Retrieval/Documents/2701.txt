computer output microform library catalog' a survey. this
    discussion of the use of com as a feasible alternative to the
    library card catalogue includes a brief history of library
    catalogues and of microform technology since world war ii. it
    is argued that com cataloguees are to be preferred to card
    catalogues, on-line catalogues accessed by terminals, and paper
    printouts. advantages and disadvantages of film or fiche
    formats for a library catalogue are explored in relation to
    retrieval performance, cost, and ease of use, and such features
    as updating procedures, readability, and possible patron
    reluctance to use com are discussed in greater depth. it is
    concluded that com appears to be the most viable answer to new
    demands placed on the library catalogue. report not available
