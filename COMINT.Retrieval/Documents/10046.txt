solar flare effect in the f layer of the ionosphere is
    plotted as a function of local mean time where is the
    difference between the measured critical frequency and the
    normal value based on that measured one hour previously the
    plot for the period of the intense solar flare of february
    shows a positive pulse of amplitude followed by a second
    smaller pulse later an analysis of the statistics of the
    fluctuations in has been made
