time symmetric filters methods are described for
    simulating filters that have impulse responses symmetrical in
    time and their application to the analysis of gliding tones is
    discussed the response of a narrow band time symmetric filter
    to a gliding tone is evaluated and shown to consist of an
    oscillation bounded by a slowly varying envelope the shape is
    governed by a parameter involving the bandwidth of the filter
    and the rate of variation of the instantaneous frequency of the
    tone
