application of electron spin resonance in a microwave
    oscillator or amplifier a brief analysis indicates the
    condition for a paramagnetic substance located within a cavity
    resonator and subjected to a direct magnetic field to supply
    power instead of absorbing it from the field results of
    preliminary experiments indicate that it should be possible to
    produce oscillations using a small sample of si containing a
    suitable impurity providing a concentration of about
    paramagnetic centres per
