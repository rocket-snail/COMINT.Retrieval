the scattering of a scalar wave by a semi infinite of rod
    of circular cross section analysis indicates that for a wave
    incident along the axis of the rod and assuming zero variation
    of field with distance at the end surface corresponding to the
    case of sound waves incident on a rigid rod the scattering
    coefficient is for where k is the wave number and a is the
    radius of the rod graphs show the variation of the average
    pressure amplitude on the end of the rod and of the scattering
    coefficient over the range the average pressure amplitude on
    the end of the rod for other angles of incidence is calculated
    an expression is derived for the scattered field when the field
    at the surface is zero corresponding to the case of an aerial
    when only the component of the electric field parallel to the
    axis of the rod is considered
