radio emission by plasma oscillations in nonuniform
    plasmas equations of motion for small amplitude plasma
    oscillations interacting with the e m field in slowly varying
    density or temperature gradients are established the r f noise
    excited by a wave packet of plasma oscillations traversing such
    gradients is calculated using the wkb approximation a similar
    calculation is made for a density discontinuity
