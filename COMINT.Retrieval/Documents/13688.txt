toy libraries in australia. a report with special
    attention to their role in services for young handicapped
    children and their families. the growth of toy libraries in
    australia has been rapid and extensive during the 70s and toy
    libraries have been established in all states and territories.
    however, evidence points to a lack of awareness on the part of
    lay people and professionals about the purposes and functions
    of toy libraries; especially in their role of serving
    handicapped children and their families. the aim of the study
    is to help overcome this lack of information and be of
    assistance to policy makers and those developing services which
    impinge on areas in which toy libraries are presently
    involved.
