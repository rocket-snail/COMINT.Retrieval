an optimizing approach to the problem of
    interdepartmental allocation of the library materials budget.
    presents a formal, mathematically expressed hypothesis
    concerning the effect of library spending by departments on
    patron welfare; then derives a formula as the solution to the
    problem of maximising patron welfare subject to the budget
    constraint that the sum of the allocations to the departments
    equals the total fund available. according to the formula, the
    appropriate share of each department depends on its numbers,
    its cost of literature, and on the values of a utility function
    parameter and a selectivity function parameter. discusses
    measurement problems, and gives an example of application using
    data from the western illinois university.
