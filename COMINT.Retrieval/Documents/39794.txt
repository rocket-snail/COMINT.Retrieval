theory of twin t rc networks and their application to
    oscillators the conditions are established which the circuit
    elements must satisfy for the network to produce infinite
    attenuation at one frequency and for the output to be either in
    phase or in phase opposition with the input at on varying two
    elements in a particular manner the slope of the phase
    frequency characteristic at is compared with that of a resonant
    lc circuit one valve oscillators incorporating such networks
    are discussed with particular attention to distortion and
    stability results of measurements on an oscillator are compared
    with values calculated from theory
