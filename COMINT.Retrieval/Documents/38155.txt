theoretical approaches to information retrieval. presents
    the results of research conducted during a visiting fellowship,
    mar 80-mar 81, on the following topics' retrieval methods of
    documents indexed by weighted index terms; similarity measures
    for boolean search request formulations and their applications;
    document-clustering-based information retrieval and document
    clustering utilising previously formed query clusters; and a
    probabilistic approach to information retrieval in systems with
    boolean search request formulations. a number of information
    retrieval techniques applicable in systems based on boolean
    searches have been introduced. special attention has been paid
    to incorporate into the standard boolean retrieval schemes a
    weighting mechanism to produce ranked lists of documents.
    several alternative approaches have been offered which are
    based on results of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic,
    probability theory and decision analysis, and the theory of
    boolean functions.
