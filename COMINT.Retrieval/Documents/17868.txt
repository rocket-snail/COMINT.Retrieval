hereditary dynamic systems with discontinuities the
    characteristics distinguishing nonlinear from linear
    oscillations are examined a class of dynamic systems termed
    discontinuous is defined cases are discussed for which
    poincares topological methods can be used to determine the
    periodic solutions and the stability such systems are included
    in the larger class of hereditary systems defined by volterra
    ie systems whose operation is affected by their previous
    history
