on the inclusiveness of systems for retrieval documents
    indexed by unweighted descriptors. one means of reducing
    information retrieval time is by taking advantage of the
    property of inclusiveness of information retrieval systems.
    when one knows the system response to a query which is more
    general in relation to another query, then in an inclusive
    retrieval system in order to retrieve the response to the more
    specific query it suffices to limit the information retrieval
    process to the search of the system response to the more
    general query. demonstrates the property of inclusiveness of
    document retrieval systems where documents are indexed by
    unweighted descriptors, and in which query search patterns are
    boolean functions of descriptors (systems using the inverted
    file method, the canonical structure file-method, or the
    sequential file method). the paper presents 3 methods for a
    determining a partial ordering relation on a set of boolean
    search patterns of queries, implying a partial orderi ng on the
    set of the system responses to these queries and discusses the
    adequacy of each method depending on the information retrieval
    method used.
