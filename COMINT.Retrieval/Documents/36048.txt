the papyrus collection of the bavarian state library and
    its catalogues. the bavarian state library papyrus collection
    of 700 items was begun about 80 years ago. not all items have
    been edited as yet since cataloguing has never kept pace with
    stock increases. the study of papyri is the youngest discipline
    connected with antiquities, being developed by mommsen in the
    19th century. in the 1970s, when the collection was moved to
    larger and better accommodation, work began on a new catalogue.
    this catalogue offers primarily editing, with descriptions of
    condition, dating and textual characteristics. it is arranged
    in 2 main sections' (1) literary texts; (2) official and
    private letters, each section being subdivided into edited and
    unedited works. initial manuscript preparation should be
    completed at the end of 1981.
