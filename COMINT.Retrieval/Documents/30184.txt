comic strips and comics in public libraries?. the
    bavarian section of the verein der bibliothekare an
    offentlichen bibliotheken (association of librarians in public
    libraries) held an advanced training session in mar 82 on the
    use of comics and other stories in picture form in libraries.
    subjects discussed included' the history of comics in the usa,
    france and germany; terminology; marketing and production;
    purchasing; and the uses of this type of material for adults,
    young children and teenagers in public libraries. popular
    themes in comics include adventure, travel, animals and men and
    superman involved in the conquest of evil. while a regrettable
    tendency towards violent and aggressive material is apparent,
    the tendency is often less strong here than in other
    media.
