interaction of modes in a microwave cavity resonator the
    minimum energy differences between the desired and undesired
    modes in a cylindrical resonator are calculated by considering
    the em field inside the resonator as due to an infinite number
    of harmonic oscillators expressions for the mutual energy and
    the coefficient of coupling between the companion modes and are
    derived the significance of the total energy of a micro wave
    cavity resonator is discussed
