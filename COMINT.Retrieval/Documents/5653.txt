the time behaviour of logarithmic amplifier input
    circuits the nonlinear nature of the logarithmic amplifier
    input circuit causes the time constant to vary with current and
    three definitions of effective time constant are examined based
    on an analysis of the time behaviour of the input circuit to a
    step change of input current
