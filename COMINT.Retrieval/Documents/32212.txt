the design of the bendix digital differential analyzer
    the error reduction scheme employed by the bendix digital
    differential analyzer which utilizes both ternary
    intercommunication between integrators and trapezoidal
    integration is described a device for the v riation and
    automatic resetting of initial conditions is discussed together
    with an example illustrating its operation finally techniques
    employed for minimizing the size of the computer are
    considered
