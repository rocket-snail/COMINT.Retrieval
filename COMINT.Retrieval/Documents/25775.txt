resonant dielectric amplifier frequency response
    discussion of an amplifier of the type in which the capacitance
    of a nonlinear capacitor excited to resonance by a carrier wave
    is modulated by a carrier wave is modulated by a signal voltage
    and an amplified output is obtained by subsequent demodulation
    with a carrier circuit q value of the carrier frequency must be
    of the order of the response to be flat up to signal
