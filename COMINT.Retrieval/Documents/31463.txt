oscillator frequency stability the case of an oscillator
    connected to a mismatched load by a long feeder is considered
    in addition to hysteresis effects with resonant loads a type of
    instability occurs which takes the form of a periodic
    modulation of the oscillation frequency stability criteria
    appropriate to both effects are derived for various circuit
    arrangements results of experiments with a triode oscillator
    operating at are reasonably consistent with the theory in
    general the hysteresis type of instability predominates
