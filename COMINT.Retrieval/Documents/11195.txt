the height variation of drift in the e region
    simultaneous observations at and of drift velocities show
    significant differences and it is deduced that they refer to
    different heights the velocities rotated through at a
    nonuniform rate during daylight hours the nonuniformity is due
    to the variation of reflection height in the winter months the
    rotation at the smaller height lagged with respect to that at
    the larger rapid changes in drift were observed during
    september and october the results agree with those deduced by
    greenhow and neufeld of from meteor trail observations if
    allowance is made for the height differences
