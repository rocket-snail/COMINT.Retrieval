the effect of solar flares on the the geomagnetic field
    the dynamo equation is solved for a conductivity produced by
    solar flare ultraviolet radiations from the sun the crochet
    amplitudes in horizontal field components are then computed and
    compared with observed results it is found that fair agreement
    exists between the theoretical and experimental values only if
    the seat of the crochet current system is within a few
    kilometers of the current system producing the quiet day solar
    variation
