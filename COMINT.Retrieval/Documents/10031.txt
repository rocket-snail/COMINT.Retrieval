improving the medlars search interview' a checklist
    approach. based on a paper presented at the annual meeting of
    the medline users group of the midwest, chicago, illinois, 6

    seen as phrasing the question to the system to obtain
    meaningful and useful results. argues that the searcher must
    act as an intermediary for the library user in questioning the
    data base-for this reason every effort must be made to maximise
    the efficiency with which a query is transferred from requestor
    to searcher. presents a checklist of areas to be covered in an
    interview for a medlars search, and discusses' topic
    appropriateness; form design and post search
    follow-through.
