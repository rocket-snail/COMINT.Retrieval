rlc lattice networks a method for synthesizing open
    circuited lattice networks to have a required transfer
    impedance is based on the partial fraction expansion of the
    given function no mutual inductances are used and series
    resistance is associated with all the self inductances so that
    low q coils may be used a numerical example is worked
