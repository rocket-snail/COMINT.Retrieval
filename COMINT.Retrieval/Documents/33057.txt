galactic radiation at radio frequencies part discrete
    sources at between declinations and one hundred and four
    discrete sources have been found individual sources are
    compared in position and flux density with those of previous
    surveys the observed distribution of sources is discussed
    several identifications with visible sources are
    suggested
