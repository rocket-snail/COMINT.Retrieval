statistical design theory for strictly digital sampled
    data systems present design theories are based on system
    response to inputs of known shape and little attention is given
    to situations in which only the statistical properties of the
    inputs are known the basis of a statistical design theory is
    presented and applied to the optimum design of a strictly
    digital system the new theory forms a close parallel to wieners
    theory of optimum filtering and prediction and its various
    manifestations in applications to continuous feedback control
    systems
