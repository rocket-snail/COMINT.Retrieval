diffusion of ionization in the sunrise f layer some
    idealized calculations support the assumption made in above
    that the rate of increase of f region electron density just
    after sunrise depends primarily on the rate of production of
    ionization at this time the loss diffusion and transport of
    ionization are of secondary importance
