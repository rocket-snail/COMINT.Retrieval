interaction of libraries and publishers. libraries and
    publishers have evolved together. publishers rely on libraries
    as a minimum market for their scholarly products. inflationary
    pressures have caused publishers to increase prices that, in
    turn, strain library budgets that have not increased as fast,
    and which, in turn, undermine the minimal demand publishers can
    count on, adding to inflationary pressure. a simple
    mathematical model for the dynamics of the interaction between
    libraries and publishers is analysed.
