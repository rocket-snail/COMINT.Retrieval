electrical properties of the blizzard the programme of
    the expedition to adelie land was not intended to cover the
    study of blizzards but the interference with radio reception
    due to this cause was found to be so bad that an investigation
    was instituted when a meter was connected between the aerial
    feeder of the atmospherics receiver and earth a current of was
    observed varying with the intensity of the wind some days later
    in identical weather conditions the same current intensities
    were measured but with reversed sign to explain this result
    extended measurements were made of the charge collected using
    horizontal aerials arranged at right angles to the wind the rf
    noise spectrum of the blizzard was also studied using a
    receiver with a frequency range of records were also made of
    reception of wwv and wwvh on and for correlation with
    anemometer and charge records the results indicate that the
    sign of the charge collected depends on the temperature of the
    blizzard reversal occurring at about the rf noise is closely
    related to the wind and intensity of the blizzard
