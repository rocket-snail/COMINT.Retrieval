viewdata deaf-aid. this brief review describes an
    experiment set up by the royal national institute for the deaf,
    british telecom and the national research development
    corporation (nrdc). the experiment involves 25 deaf people with
    a good command of speech and explores the possibilities of
    holding telephone conversations with hearing friends via a
    'voice bureau'. nrdc equipment, called palantype, is used and
    this allows the operator to type out the spoken word onto a
    prestel-type tv screen, thus enabling the deaf person to see
    the 'conversation'. even if trials are successful, however, a
    general service will only be envisaged if high operational
    costs can be overcome.
