the shape of irregularities in the upper ionosphere
    observations of radio stellar scintillations made with three
    spaced receivers on a frequency of show that irregularities in
    the amplitude pattern on the ground are regarded statistically
    elliptically shaped the ratio of major to minor axis being at
    least the direction of the major axis of the corresponding
    ellipsoidal ionospheric irregularities appears to be along the
    lines of force of the earths magnetic field estimates of the
    drift velocity of ionospheric irregularities based on the
    assumption that the ionospheric pattern has spherical symmetry
    are hence subject to error
