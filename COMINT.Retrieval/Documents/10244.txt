filters built from coaxial conductors zobels method of
    filter design is applied to coaxial line filters considering
    the impedance of the line as a function of frequency
    characteristics can therefore bermined for the entire frequency
    range design data are shown in a series of tables and four
    types of filter section are discussed in detail
