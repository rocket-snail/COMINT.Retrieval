database communication in a heterogenous database
    management system network. an architectural approach is
    outlined, to fulfil the need for an integrated data base
    communication system able to support any user in any network
    node, without incurring mass migration of data. a global query
    translator processes queries into a global conceptual model of
    information content, and a global internal model of data to
    form an access-path oriented model of the structure of the
    integrated system. sub-queries are formed using a query
    decomposer and access path selectors, and are translated into
    the data base language. the role of layers and mappings in the
    proposed architecture is defined between the virtual model and
    the local physical data base. the entity-relationship and
    diam-sddt models are described and compared with general data
    base management systems. an example of an integrated network
    heterogenous data base is followed by a description of
    inter-data base relationships in the unified global conceptual
    model.
