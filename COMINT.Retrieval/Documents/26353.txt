either we move or else we stop accepting more books.
    describes the deposit library and its space problems. unless
    the library moves from its present accommodation in the
    basement of the library school within half a year, it will have
    to start refusing books from public libraries. the library's
    purpose is to store books which have been culled from public
    libraries and to lend or give them to other libraries, and
    therefore it must necessarily grow at a time when other
    libraries contract. the library began in 1968 with 1400 sq.m.;
    later a further 175 sq.m. were added for shelving and 1000
    sq.m. in a warehouse elsewhere. a suitable building of 7700
    sq.m. is now available cheaply. with an increase of 25,000
    volumes a year, this would secure enough space until the 90s.
    running costs will be 5.1 million kr. in 82 as compared to the
    present 3.6 million kr., and cost of establishment will be 2.7
    million kr. the danish library association, the national
    association of local authorities and the librar y council have
    now recommended that the money should come from the public
    libraries' disposition fund, not otherwise used for such
    purposes, as the source of the library's finance, the public
    libraries' joint appropriation, would be unable to cope. the
    library is a last resort, after the central libraries, for
    ordinary people for the lending of older books and meets 55% of
    enquiries, a figure which would be higher if a catalogue of
    holdings existed.
