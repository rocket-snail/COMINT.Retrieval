effect of the solar eclipse of february on the ionosphere
    e layer in equatorial africa a report and discussion of
    observations of e layer critical frequencies at bangui the
    critical frequency of the e layer decreased suddenly at the
    commencement of the eclipse and was soon masked by that of the
    e layer a graph of the observed values of e shows that the
    effects of the eclipse were certainly perceptible some to
    minutes before the first contact a explanation of the observed
    effects is based on the assumption of two solar regions more
    active than the rest one in the corona near the western edge of
    the disk the other near the eastern edge
