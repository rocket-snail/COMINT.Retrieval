theory of correlation tables. 2. a process has been given
    for the optimisation of spectroscopical correlation tables
    containing complex primary and subfragments. the method is
    based on information theory and provides the quantitative
    evaluation of the usefulness of any change within a given
    correlation table. in this way, for example, it shows in which
    case it is expedient to specialise a fragment and also when it
    is worth drawing together several subfragments into one
    fragment. the process can easily be expressed as a computer
    algorithm, and in this way it can be useful for a set of
    computerised systems for spectrum analysis.
