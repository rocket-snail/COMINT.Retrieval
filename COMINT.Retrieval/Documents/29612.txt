the need for in-service training for librarians in higher
    vocational education: report of a questionnaire held by the hbo
    group committee of the dutch association of librarians. since
    the formation in 1976 of the group for libraries in higher
    vocational education within the nederlandse vereniging van
    bibliothecarissen, documentalisten en literatuuronderzoekers
    (dutch association of librarians, documentalists and
    information scientists), group members have on several
    occasions proposed that a scheme of in-service professional
    training for librarians be started. in 1979 the group committee
    agreed to these proposals and in oct 80 a questionnaire was
    circulated to members to ascertain what form such training
    should take. of the 79 respondents more than &h expressed a
    wish for courses in audio-visual media, management techniques
    and library automation, and over 75% were willing to pursue
    such courses in their spare time. the results of the
    questionnaire have now been presented to the associati on of
    schools of librarianship and documentation in the netherlands
    for consideration.
