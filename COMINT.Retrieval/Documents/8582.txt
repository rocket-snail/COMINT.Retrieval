what can the public library do to increase literacy?. the
    public library is traditionally regarded as a resource for
    culturally advanced and literate people. south africa has both
    developed and developing communities. while the public library
    usually focuses on the needs of established readers, there is a
    substantial case for providing innovative forms of service to
    illiterate and neo-literate communities, and for actually
    promoting literacy through the library. the concept of literacy
    is discussed in terms of the developed and developing sectors,
    and literacy is placed in its cultural context. the problems of
    semi-illiteracy among educated people are seen as part of the
    spectrum of illiteracy, which extends from formally educated
    people with poor reading ability to uneducated rural dwellers.
    the role of the public library with regard to literacy across
    the spectrum is discussed, with specific suggestions given for
    tasks which the public library can undertake to promote
    literacy.
