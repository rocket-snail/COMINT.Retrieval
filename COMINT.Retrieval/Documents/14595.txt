a precise determination of the charge of the electron
    from shot noise the electron charge is calculated from the shot
    fluctuations of saturation current in a specially constructed
    diode connected diode connected across a tuned circuit resonant
    at from precision measurements of circuit parameters and the
    mean square value of shot noise the final result obtained
    is
