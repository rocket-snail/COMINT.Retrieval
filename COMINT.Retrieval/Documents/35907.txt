selective properties of an oscillator system synchronized
    by a harmonic signal theoretical investigation of the
    dependence of the amplitude and phase oscillations of an
    oscillator on the interference of a quasiharmonic e m f the
    effect on the system of harmonic and fluctuation noise is
    briefly examined
