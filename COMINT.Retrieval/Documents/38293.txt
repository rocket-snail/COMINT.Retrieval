piggy in the middle: observations on the role of the
    intermediary. it was confidently expected by system designers
    that on-line bibliographic search systems, with their ability
    to provide direct and immediate access to information, would be
    interrogated by the end user. a review of the literature
    reveals however, that contrary to such expectations, most
    searches are still being performed by trained intermediaries.
    clearly, the attempt to convert former off-line batch systems
    used by either computer scientists or information specialists,
    into on-line interactive systems for use by all has not worked,
    despite the claims of their designers to having developed 'user
    friendly' systems.
