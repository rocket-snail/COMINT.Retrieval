quality, collaboration and citations in cancer research'
    a bibliometric study. (phd thesis-florida state university.)
    the patterns of and interrelationships among quality,
    collaboration, citations, and self-citations of cancer research
    were investigated using samples of papers from 1974. the
    collaborative index (average number of authors per paper) was
    estimated to be 2.98 (a high figure). cancer research was found
    to be highly cited. as quality increased, scatter among
    journals and countries decreased. quantity and quality within a
    given country were highly correlated. the self-citation/total
    citation ratio depended on quality and age of the
    papers.
