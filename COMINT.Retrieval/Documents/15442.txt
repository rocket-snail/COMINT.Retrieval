the capacity and field of a split cylindrical condenser
    using the method of inversion the complex potential of a split
    cylindrical condenser is obtained by inversion of a known
    simpler case expressions are obrained for the value of the
    electrostatic field at points on the axes of symmetry the
    surface density of charge on a conductor and the capacity of
    the condenser the expressions obtained by adams using another
    method are deduced as one of three special cases for which
    tables and graphs are provided the results should prove of
    value in the design of electrode systems for various
    purposes
