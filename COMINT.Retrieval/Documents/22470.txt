the mechanism of secondary electron emission a simple
    theory based on the constant energy loss per unit path length
    of primary electrons accounts quantitatively for the variation
    of secondary electron yield below its maximum value the theory
    can be extended to include a bethe type energy loss at high
    primary energies relations between secondary electron emission
    and atomic structure are discussed secondary emission in
    insulators and semiconductors is also considered
