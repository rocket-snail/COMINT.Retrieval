film-shows and libraries. following a request by
    hordaland county library, delegates from the norwegian state
    film centre, the national association of municipal
    cinematographers, and the state library office discussed
    film-shows as part of library service. libraries, like local
    authorities and cultural committees, can obtain permission for
    film-shows, certain short or informational films being exempt.
    cooperation between library and authority may include exchange
    of information, joint shows for preschool children, use of film
    in further education, and showing of films and videotapes in
    libraries. good children's films are ideal for library showing
    and can be linked with books. not all library premises are
    suitable for film-shows; this factor should be considered in
    planning new libraries. loan of films should be administered by
    county libraries. all libraries should have film catalogues,
    possibly distributed by the state library office. the
    association of cinematographers hope to purchase several sets
    of apparatus for use in selected areas.
