summary of activities of the ifla section on information
    technology since 1963. the terms of reference of the section,
    as documented in the medium-term programme of ifla, give only
    the major points of the section's responsibility. these terms
    of reference have been expanded to reflect the interest of the
    section in information networks, copyright of machine-readable
    data files, and transnational data flow issues. for historical
    purposes the activities of the past years and their
    relationship to the future are described. these activities have
    been grouped into three categories' meetings and symposia,
    cooperation in working groups, and other activities. also
    included is a list of papers presented to the section on
    information technology of ifla from 1965 to 1980.
