experimental investigations of the electronic band
    structure of solids experiments are discussed which have been
    of value in contributing to current knowledge of the band
    structure of many materials of importance at present the
    experiments mentioned including those involving the de haasvan
    alphen effect cyclotron resonance the galvanomagnetic effect
    and infrared absorption
