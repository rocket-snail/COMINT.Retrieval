synthesis of constant time delay networks the synthesis
    of low pass filters to have a symmetrical transient response
    such as is desirable in television receivers is investigated
    the desired frequency response is expanded in a fourier series
    circuit elements corresponding to the terms of the series are
    constituted by sections of delay lines which are appropriately
    combined to give the desired overall response low pass band
    pass and band stop filters are considered results obtained with
    experimental filters are discussed
