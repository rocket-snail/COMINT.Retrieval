tunable microwave aerial diplexer a diplexer for the band
    is based on the use of continuously tunable resonant circuits
    comprising coaxial line sections short circuited at one end and
    having a third coaxial conductor insulated from and sliding
    within the inner conductor in a particular design illustrated
    for separation between transmission and reception frequencies
    the transmitted energy penetrating into the receiver is
    attenuated by
