a case for replacing the 35-mm aperture card with the
    105-mm fiche. the aperture card has been in use for nearly 30
    years. it was developed to facilitate the data processing of
    engineering drawing information. since the primary business
    data processing equipment during the early 50s was the ibm
    punched card (or hollerith card), the aperture card was
    designed around this medium. explores the advantages and
    disadvantages of 105-mm fiche over aperture cards for
    engineering drawing information and questions why micrographic
    users have to deal with 2 completely different systems to
    produce a micrographic record.
