information flow and analysis' theory, simulation, and
    experiments. 1. basic theoretical and conceptual development.
    this series of articles describes research which has been
    underway at the ohio state university in an effort to develop a
    fundamental and general theory of information flow and
    analysis. more specifically, the research attempts to (1)
    identify and quantify important variables and parameters in the
    information flow process; (2) establish relationships among
    these variables; (3) apply the theory to practical situations
    and to examine the resulting implications; and (4) develop
    models, both simulation and experimental, to utilise and
    validate the theory.
