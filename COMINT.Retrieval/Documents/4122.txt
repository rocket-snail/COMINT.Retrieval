a voltage stabilizer for a radio frequency extra high
    tension set the voltage to be stabilized is applied across a
    bank of resistors and a fraction is balanced against a rf
    reference voltage the difference being converted in a circuit
    comprising two valves type to a signal which is amplified
    rectified in a phase sensitive circuit and applied to control
    the screen voltage of the main oscillator curves show the
