when the readers don't come' an attempt at integrating
    the library into an area of urban renewal. the st. pauli
    district of hamburg is a socially underprivileged area where
    slum clearance is taking place. in 1980, library stocks
    totalled 20,000 volumes of which 800 are turkish literature
    provided for the many foreign residents; there are also games
    and german and turkish cassettes. the book turnover is below
    the average for hamburg libraries. since many adult residents
    either understood little german or are confused by the
    library's technical procedures, few of them use the library.
    local children tend to use the library as a meeting-place,
    which causes noise but does provide somewhere to play. the
    librarian, moving away from purely traditional librarianship,
    works closely with local social workers, visiting families to
    discuss problems and allowing them to use the library for
    meetings; this helps to integrate the library into the
    community.
