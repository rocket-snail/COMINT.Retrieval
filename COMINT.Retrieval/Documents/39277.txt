laboratory notebook storage and retrieval systems.
    despite the general conclusion that laboratory notebooks
    contain valuable and often needed data, there has been
    relatively little discussion in the literature on the
    development of an adequate storage and retrieval system for
    them. to determine the various possibilities of such a system,
    a survey of 83 food science libraries was conducted. 60% of the
    libraries employed some kind of a system. 4 different systems
    were identified; and the system that allowed access by notebook
    author and notebook accession number was predominant.
