directional channel separation filters networks are
    discussed which combine the properties of directional couplers
    with those of conventional filters such networks are useful for
    channel combining separating micro wave communication systems
    and in installations where a single aerial is shared by several
    systems designs using waveguides coaxial and strip lines and
    lumped constant circuits are indicated the performance of some
    experimental filters is described
