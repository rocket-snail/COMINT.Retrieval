library science in theory and practice. in the usa, uk
    and communist countries, library science is now fully
    established as a scientific discipline and included amongst
    university faculties. since the 19th century, however, opinion
    in west germany has been divided as to whether library science
    has its own theoretic basis or whether it consists of purely
    practical knowledge. examination of the respective arguments
    suggests that library science can be regarded as an applied
    science closely linked with other disciplines, e.g. information
    science, communication, cybernetics and linguistics. historical
    aspects of librarianship emphasised hitherto should play only a
    subordinate role; the main emphasis must be on scientifically
    based, economic library administration linked with research.
    cologne is the only german university possessing a library
    science faculty; more such faculties are needed to produce
    librarians of the required calibre.
