dynamics and structure of the outer radiation belt an
    analysis of electron measurements made in explorer is presented
    in terms of four time independent parameters of the outer van
    allen belt the belt has two peaks of intensity e max amd e max
    during a storm coincides with dipole lines of force max is used
    as a tracer to follow changes in the magnetic field some
    changes are accounted for only by invoking an irreversible
    energy gain or loss in the belt the peaks are observed to move
    radially inward during a storm and peak electron intensities
    fall by about
