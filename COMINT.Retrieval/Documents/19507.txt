a scalar representation of electromagnetic fields it is
    shown that in a region which is free from currents and charges
    any em field may be rigorously derived from a single generally
    complex scalar wave function the momentum density and energy
    density defined in terms of this function differ from those
    given by the usual expressions but the differences disappear on
    integration over any arbitrary macroscopic domain
