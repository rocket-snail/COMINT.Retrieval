spontaneous voltage fluctuations in a resonant circuit
    the rms value of voltage fluctuations of thermal origin at the
    terminals of a parallel rlc circuit is determined for the
    unusual case where the frequency range in question is not
    negligible in comparison with the bandwidth of the resonant
    circuit curves are given to facilitate numerical
    calculation
