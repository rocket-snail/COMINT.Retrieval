field swept maser oscillation the application by singer
    and want of september of their analysis of maser oscillations
    to experimental results of the author is criticized they
    attribute the oscillations to energy exchange between cavity
    and emitting sample th radiation envelope is however largely
    determined by the zeeman field sweep rate due to a different
    mechanism
