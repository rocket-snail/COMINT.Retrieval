filters with very narrow pass band variable on the
    principle of the fabry perot interferometer analysis is given
    for a narrow band rf amplifier with n equal stages each
    comprising a valve and a three mesh cr phase shift network
    maximum gain is obtained at a frequency slightly different from
    that for which the phase shift is a relative bandwidth of is
    attainable with stages
