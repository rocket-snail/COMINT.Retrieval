simultaneous asynchronous oscillations in class c
    oscillators it is shown theoretically and practically that self
    starting asynchronous oscillations are possible in a class c
    pentode oscillator transient and steady state solutions are
    obtained for such an oscillator with one and two degrees of
    freedom
