    and cassettes. librarians are often uncertain of the right
    choices in a large market. a broad outline is given of cassette
    material available in germany for' short courses for tourists,

    textbooks with complementary cassettes; and complete language
    courses with textbooks, grammar, dictionaries, exercises,
    cassettes and notes for teachers. possible criteria for
    evaluation are' the extent to which the course content is
    adapted to adult needs; the suitability of the course's
    didactic construction to those needs, especially the use of
    realistic situations and background information; the topicality
    of vocabulary, idiom and grammar; and the acoustic quality,
    which should use different speakers and natural speech rhythm
    and melody, with pauses for students to repeat words and
    phrases. (for parts i and ii, 2see1 82/5287 and
