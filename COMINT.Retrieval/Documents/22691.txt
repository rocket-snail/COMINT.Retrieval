conceptual dimensions of library management. suggests a
    descriptive model that would interrelate some familiar concepts
    of library management within a unified system. the approach is
    theoretical, concentrating on a relational nature of conceptual
    management, distinguishing it from the traditional pragmatic
    definition. the model illustrates the 3-dimensional nature of
    library administration, encompassing the procedural-technical,
    the contextual-service oriented, and the conceptual-theoretical
    levels of librarianship.
