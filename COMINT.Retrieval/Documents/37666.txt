influence of inhomogeneity of a plasma on its resonance
    frequency nonuniformity of the electron concentration in the
    plasma may give rise to variations of in the resonance
    frequency this explains the langmuir relation and experimental
    results the effect of damping is however negligible as are also
    magnetic effects
