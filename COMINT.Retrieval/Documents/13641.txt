changes in the absorption of cosmic noise observed during
    two ionospheric disturbances curves are given showing the
    observed time variation of total absorption at at the period of
    ionospheric disturbances on following the suggestions of
    increased absorption is shown to be correlated with increased
    and is presumably due to region attenuation deductions are made
    as to the path and speed of the disturbances
