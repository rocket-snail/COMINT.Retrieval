secondary electron emission of crystalline mgo single
    crystals of mgo in bulk form cleft along the plane were used
    the maximum secondary emission ratio is about at room
    temperature and with a bombarding voltage of about no
    correlation between conductivity and yield was established
    increase in temperature led to a decrease in yield the most
    probable energy of emission is about theoretical considerations
    based on band theory support these observations
