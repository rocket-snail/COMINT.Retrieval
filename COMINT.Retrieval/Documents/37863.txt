    bookfair, brixton, london, 22 nov 80. the paper was one of 3
    workshops devoted to different aspects of education. discusses
    the concept of multi-cultural library service, suggesting that
    commitment to such service by any authority must logically
    extend into an anti-racist policy. language, class cultures,
    acquisition of materials, stock selection, determination of
    appropriate levels of provision, and staff attitudes are all
    examined in relation to provision of a multi-cultural
    service.
