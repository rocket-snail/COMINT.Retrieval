intelligent terminals for library and information work.
    discusses the nature of intelligent terminals, their useful
    facilities, and their possible future development, with special
    regard to the requirements of the library and information
    community. section 1 deals with the current basic terminal and
    then elaborates on the facilities which may be added to improve
    its intelligence, such as internal memory, enhanced display,
    multiple peripherals, improved communications ability,
    sophisticated control facilities, and programmability. the
    facilities are described and some idea of their utility is
    given. the uses of the terminal are discussed in areas such as
    information retrieval, cataloguing, training, data entry, and
    library housekeeping. useful facilities of an intelligent
    terminal are outlined and examples given. the future is
    considered under the headings of hardware, software, and
    networking development. here projections are made for the
    development of the terminals and their use for the next few
    years.
