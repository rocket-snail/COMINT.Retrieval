effect of electrical fluctuations on a valve oscillator
    the effect of slow normal fluctuations is considered
    expressions are derived for the one dimensional probability
    density functions for amplitude and phase an approximate method
    is shown for calculating the correlation functions for
    amplitude and phase variations
