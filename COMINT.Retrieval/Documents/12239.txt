symmetrical matrix analysis of parametric amplifiers and
    converters expressions are derived for gain bandwidth and noise
    figure and by regarding the matrix as a nodal admittance array
    an equivalent conductance c rcuit is constructed it is shown
    that for low no se figure and wide bandwidth the idler
    frequency should be much higher than the signal
    frequency
