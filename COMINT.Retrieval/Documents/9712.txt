conventional cataloguing techniques and information
    retrieval. taking the cataloguing of audio-visual materials
    using practices evolved for printed documents as a starting
    point, considers the restrictions imposed on research when
    information retrieval can only be effected through the
    restricted approaches permitted by standard reductive
    cataloguing codes. attempts to apply conventional cataloguing
    procedures to audio-visual material require the transcription
    of images and sounds into textual equivalents, for integration
    with the existing collection of written documents. searching by
    purely visual or audio qualities is impossible. equally,
    written documents can only be accessed by a limited number of
    established approaches. reference is made to recent published
    discussion of problems in audio-visual cataloguing and
    strategies to solve them.
