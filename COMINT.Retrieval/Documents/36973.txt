on the nature of the discrete radio sources investigation
    of results of measurements of radio noise from a source in
    cassiopeia shows that the noise may be due to interaction of
    cosmic ray electrons with the local magnetic field if the
    average value of the latter is of the oder of gauss the rf
    power received shoul then vary at leastas rapidly as below a
    critical frequency in the range
