geomagnetic distortion of the region on the magnetic
    equator part two an extension of work described earlier to
    study the relation between diurnal variations of years of
    different sunspot number and the phase of germagnetic
    variations region distortion is explatned by vertical
    ionization drift due to the field extended from the
    region
