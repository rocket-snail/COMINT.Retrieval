a maser amplifier for radio astronomy at x band the
    design and operating characteristics of a maser radio meter for
    use in radio astronomy at wavelength are discussed the
    operating system which is described has a bandwidth of and an
    input noise temperature including background radiation into the
    antenna of about k an rms fluctuation level of about is
    attained using an averaging time of seconds a discussion of the
    factors determining the sensitivity of such devices is
    presented
