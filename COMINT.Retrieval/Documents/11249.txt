the hamiltonian formalism of damping in a tuned circuit
    an lc circuit coupled to a transmission line is studied as an
    example of introducing damping into the quantum mechanical
    treatment of a harmonic oscillator the problem of coupling a
    spin system to the current in the inductance is also
    studied
