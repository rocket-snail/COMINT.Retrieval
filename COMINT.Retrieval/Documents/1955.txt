the legal status of university libraries in the rhineland
    palatinate. the 1978 rhineland palatinate state law on
    universities has made the position of university libraries more
    difficult than it was under the 1970 law with regard to their
    spheres of competence. current legislation is particularly
    vague about who should make decisions in library affairs, the
    rights of the various university bodies and their relationships
    with one another. detailed analysis is made of the 1978 law and
    its relevance to the library, the legal position of the
    library, its director and the senate and of individual legal
    problems such as the authority for stock purchase, control of
    staffing and finance, decisions on staffing made by the senate
    president, the library's tasks outside the university and legal
    disputes between the library and other university bodies. this
    analysis could prove helpful to university libraries in other
    states with similar laws.
