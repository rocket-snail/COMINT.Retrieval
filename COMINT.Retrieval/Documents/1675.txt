explicit formulas for tschebyscheff and butterworth
    ladder networks a new set of simple formulae has been found for
    the element values in a tchebycheff or butterworth ladder
    network which apply when the degree of the denominator of the
    transfer function is odd and the reflection coefficient has
    zeros alternating in the left and right half planes
