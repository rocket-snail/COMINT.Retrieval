perturbations in nonlinear filtered systems applications
    to the theory of oscillators conventional methods of studying
    feed back amplifier stability can be applied to separable
    filtered systems comprising a nonlinear frequency independent
    unit followed or preceded by a linear selective circuit of and
    back references the theory of free and synchronized modes is
    extended to the case of frequency division stability is
    investigated by introducing two different coefficients for the
    in phase and quadrature components of the perturbation voltage
    so that the system can be treated as an amplifier with two
    feedback loops the method is applied to determine the effect on
    the output of a valve oscillator due to lf modulation at the
    grid
