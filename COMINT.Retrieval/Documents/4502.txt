noise figure measurements on two types of variable
    reactance amplifiers using semiconductor diodes the use of
    semiconductor diodes in an up converter and in a negative
    resistance amplifier at is described a bandwidth of was
    obtained with the latter at a maximum gain of and a noise
    figure as low as has been achieved
