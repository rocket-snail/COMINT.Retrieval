considering the disabled in school libraries' attitudes
    and library design. with the introduction and increasing
    prevalence of mainstreaming in schools, it is inevitable that
    some students will have to cope with some degree of disability.
    disabilities vary tremendously, both in type and degree to
    which normal functioning is impaired. it is essential that all
    students be given the same consideration and respect regardless
    of individual differences. librarians can contribute most by
    understanding the special difficulties and needs of the child.
    abilities rather than disabilities need to be emphasised.
    besides psychological and social barriers, the problem of
    simple physical access must be considered. design features that
    must be considered include access to the building, access
    within the library and access to all library services.
