measurement of secondary electron emission the sources of
    error in secondary electron emiss on determinations are
    discussed in detail retarding voltage curves obtained
    experimentally are analysed and a method of calculating the
    proportion electron current is given for the cz case w en the
    target and spherical collector are made of the same material
    for a cr ni alloy and a pr mary potential of this proportion
    is
