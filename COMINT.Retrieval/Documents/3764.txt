use of a maximal common subgraph algorithm in the
    automatic identification of the ostensible bond changes
    occurring in chemical reactions. a fast procedure is described
    for the discovery of the largest substructure common to the
    reactant and product molecules in a chemical reaction. once
    this substructure has been found, it is possible to identify
    automatically those bonds in the reacting molecules which have
    apparently been broken or formed in the course of the reaction;
    these bond changes could be used as indexing terms for the
    retrieval of chemical reaction information.
