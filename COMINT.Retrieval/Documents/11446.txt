deichman library and series books for children. in spring
    79 deichman library, oslo, stopped buying children's series
    books and discarded worn-out stock copies. they were surprised
    by hostile public reaction (a selection of readers' letters to
    oslo newspapers is appended), having regarded the move as
    correcting a long-standing mistake. since the mid-60s deichman
    had bought a few copies of 2hardy boys1 and similar titles,
    recognised as sub-standard literature, but intended to lead
    children to better books and increase the then inadequate
    selection of children's literature. by 1979 the standard of
    norwegian children's literature had greatly improved and the
    number of available titles increased. in view of rising book
    prices, priority was given to good norwegian children's books
    rather than adult and foreign books in children's departments
    (excepting books for immigrants). series books were excluded
    for a year as an experiment.
