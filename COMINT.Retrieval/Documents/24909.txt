current balancing reactors for semiconductor rectifiers
    in both semiconductor and mercury arc rectifiers of high
    current capacity where many diodes are connected in parallel
    the currents in the separate units must be balanced balancing
    arrangements for semiconductor rectifiers are described
    including the use of punched laminations as strip type
    reactors
