the design of low frequency high pass filters the design
    of a twin network incorporated in a feedback amplifier circuit
    is discussed and details are given relating frequency response
    to phase shift in the amplifier the use of compensating
    sections for securing a flat pass band characteristic is
    considered and a practical example is worked out
