experimental study of the diffraction of microwaves by
    rotationally symmetrical apertures measurements at have been
    made using circular and annular apertures the results indicate
    that diffraction calculations based on kirchhoffs approximation
    are accurate to within at planes as close as twice the diameter
    of the aperture the accuracy improving as the distance
    increases
