noise in an amplifier stage with negative voltage
    feedback the problem is considered with particular reference to
    the input circuit of an amplifier for a magnetic tape recorder
    analysis indicates that frequency distortion inherent in the
    system can be corrected by use of negative feedback at the
    input valve and indicates the existence of an optimum ratio for
    the input transformer from the point of view of signal noise
