the library service's reviews and libraries' book
    purchases. faced with cuts in book budgets, librarians have to
    choose to which groups of users they should give priority'
    those who use the library most, i.e. those with higher
    education, or the minority for whom the need for meaningful
    activities beyond tv and weekly magazines in a time of
    unemployment is great. fears that cuts are made, not in the
    pulp entertainment literature but in books by quality authors.
    instead of defending what is culturally valuable, librarians
    give in to popular demand in order to achieve high loan
    figures. the relationship between the library service's reviews
    and library purchases demonstrates this' well reviewed quality
    books are bought in small numbers, whereas multiple copies are
    bought of entertainment literature, despite lukewarm
    reviews.
