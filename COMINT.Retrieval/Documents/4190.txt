information science and its significance for scientific
    research activities. one of the ways of increasing the
    contribution of scientific information services to scientific
    creative work is through their identification with the logical,
    psychological, social and organisational needs of the research
    process. cooperation itself between research and information
    workers can begin even before there is a specific research
    task; some institutions have experimented with the policy that
    each new researcher has to spend a month or 2 in the
    information department. the cooperation goes through several
    stages, from the preliminary search to avoid duplication in
    research to the closer collaboration of both partners' teams.
    sometimes the collaboration is so close that an information
    scientist becomes a co-author.
