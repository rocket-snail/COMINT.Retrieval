disk seal triode amplifiers for decimetre wavelength
    radio links amplifiers for increasing the transmitter output
    power and receiver sensitivity in existing links are considered
    grounded grid circuits are used simple formulae are derived for
    gain and bandwidth giving values in good agreement with
    experimental results obtained with type and type valves
