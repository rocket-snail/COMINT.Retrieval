pricing objectives for public library services.
    opportunities and problems confronting a public library in its
    pricing decision are related to its pricing objectives.
    examines 6 objectives of price and identifies the likely
    outcomes associated with each objective. these objectives are
    market equity, social equity, maximum opportunity for
    participation, maximising revenue, rationing, and commercial
    sector encouragement. it is unlikely that a library will have
    one overall pricing objective which is applicable to all the
    services it delivers. the price ultimately adopted for any
    particular service will depend on which objectives are
    uppermost in priority and will represent the best compromise
    among conflicting objectives.
