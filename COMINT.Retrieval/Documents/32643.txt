determination of the bandwidth of band pass filters for
    centimetre waves theory developed previously of is used to
    analyse the band pass filter operation of an arbitrary
    arrangement of coupled cavity resonators a detailed treatment
    is given for the system comprising two stagger tuned coupled
    resonators
