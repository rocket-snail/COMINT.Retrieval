a theorem on ideal transformer networks by applying the
    principle of duality to an impedance inversion network a
    general theorem on ideal transformation of voltage current and
    both voltage and current is derived provided the resistive
    components of reactors are sufficiently small the theorem may
    be applied in designing networks which can be tuned by a single
    control through a range of frequencies with fixed
    transformation ratio to give a variable transformation ratio at
    a fixed frequency
