design of conditionally stable feedback systems
    conditionally stable systems are shown to have a greater
    feedback than that obtainable from unconditionally stable
    feedback circuits the design of such systems is analysed
    mathematically and a practical method for automatically
    preventing oscillation occurring in them is suggested
    experimental results obtained with a suitable circuit are
    presented
