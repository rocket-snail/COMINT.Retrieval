international patent classification from the viewpoint of
    japanese users. to clarify the rules of ipc (international
    patent classification), the japanese patent office has issued a
    working standard for assigning ipcs, the contents of which are
    briefly described. in some selected groups, the japanese patent
    office uses an ipc subdivision called 'developing marks'; in
    others, a special classification is used, called 'facet
    classification marks'. mentions some japanese proposals for the
    4th edition of ipc, preparation of which is under way.
