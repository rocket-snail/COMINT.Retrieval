further data on the design of eccles jornan flip flops
    full text of paper presented at the aiee summer general meeting
    june analysis under specified conditions of the grounded
    cathode type of flip flop circuit including no inductors a
    graphical design technique is described which should facilitate
    the design of switching circuits using a large number of
    identical direct coupled circuits
