nuclear magnetic resonance in very weak fields a radio
    spectroscope for observation of resonance between the apparatus
    is described in detail the signal noise ratio is calculated and
    the result compared with values obtained experimentally study
    of nuclear magnetic resonance between proton resonance
    experiments are described variation of resonance curves with
    amplitude and with the characteristics of the scanning field is
    investigated
