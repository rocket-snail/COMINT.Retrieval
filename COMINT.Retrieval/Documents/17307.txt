diffraction of electromagnetic waves radiated from an
    arbitrarily oriented electric or magnetic dipole at an ideally
    conducting half plane the solving of this problem is simplified
    by writing maxwells equations in a general form so as to
    include the case of a conducting medium with a finite
    permeability and by including a magnetic current for reasons of
    symmetry the equation is solved for different boundary
    conditions of p in particular cases p represents components of
    the electric or magnetic fields or vector potentials or vector
    potentials t is a function of position which is zero except in
    a small volume element surrounding the dipole and with the
    usual notation for the dielectric constant angular frequency
    electrical conductivity permeability velocity of light and to
    the solutions for various orientations of the dipole are given
    in the form of definite single integrals which can be
    evaluated
