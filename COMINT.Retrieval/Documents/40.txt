investigation of the possibilities of a nonreactive
    parallel connection of two oscillators in the short wave range
    scattering matrices are used to calculate the characteristics
    of three and four port networks and a comparison of their
    suitability for parallel connection is made application to
    waveguide circuits is discussed
