surveys on privacy and big business, banking, and
    insurance. the surveys, conducted by the survey research
    laboratory, university of illinois, sought to determine the
    extent to which policies safeguarding personal, financial and
    other information have been implemented. results indicate that
    some large us industrial corporations have inadequate policies
    to protect sensitive employee data from possible abuse; the
    idea that a person's finances are a private matter between him
    and his banker is no longer true; and that most insurance
    companies have adopted many protections recommended by the us
    privacy protection study commission after an investigation into
    the insurance industry's record-keeping practices.
