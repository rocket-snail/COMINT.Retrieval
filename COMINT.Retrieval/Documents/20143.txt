the resources and services of the uppsala university
    library during the seventeenth century. when the university of
    uppsala was re-established in the 1620s by king gustavus
    adolphus, a well-equipped university library was seen as an
    important pre-requisite. the library was moved several times,
    and in 1638 a permanent post of librarian was created. the book
    collection was arranged by faculty, and systematic indices were
    produced. student were not allowed to borrow books for home
    reading, although professors could do so, and professors often
    stood bail for those who defaulted on the restrictions.
    librarians were chosen from amongst the university's most
    renowned professors. ultimately, considerable cataloguing work
    was carried out, fixed hours were established, and the
    library's lending policy became more liberal.
