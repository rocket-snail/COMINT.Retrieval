e pluribus unum-or not?. contribution to a special
    feature on the future of associations. in the last year there
    has been much concern over 'trouble' at the american library
    association hq. ala divisions seek greater participation in the
    conduct of their own financial and personal affairs, including
    the right to determine their own dues structures and policies,
    the right to larger allocations from ala's general fund, and
    the right to more participation in the selection of the person
    hired to represent their interests at ala hq. a proposed
    'operating agreement for ala and its divisions' addresses many
    of these concerns, and is the product of discussions between
    ala hq staff and divisional officers.
