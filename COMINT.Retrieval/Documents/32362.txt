literature requirements of research work. information on
    research topics must be up to date. for topic retrieval, a
    researcher can make a personal card index of journal articles,
    or check 2current contents1. alternatively he may rely on 1 or
    2 comprehensive works and their references. however, papers in
    2pharmacological review1 or 2physiological review1, from

    the important publications on a particular topic. the
    literature base should be enlarged.
