the dissociation of oxygen in the high atmosphere the
    transition region is investigated using recent data on
    atmospheric transmission of solar radiation in the spectral
    region of the schumann runge continuum of o observational data
    can be represented by a complete mixing of the atmosphere which
    causes the vertical distribution of molecular oxygen to follow
    atmospheric scale height mixing and diffusing processes are
    responsible for a shift in the transition region to lower
    heights than given by photochemical equilibrium considerations
    thus the transition region must be associated with the
    mesopause airglow formation of ionosphere regions and
    dissociation of nitrogen are briefly discussed in the light of
    this theory
