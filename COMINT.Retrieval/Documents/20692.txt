the background to a zeeland amalgamation' the zeeland
    provincial library and the middleburg public library. in the
    netherlands the provincial council of zeeland and the city
    council of middleburg in 1981 agreed jointly to provide *67
    million for the construction of a new library. the building
    which is due for completion in 1974 will house the combined
    provincial and city libraries together with the zeeland central
    music library. lack of space in the present library buildings
    and the need for closer cooperation between the provincial and
    city libraries led to the decision to combine their services.
    the new building will have a surface area of 12,000 sq.m. on 5
    floors with space for 100 staff and emphasis will be placed on
    the use of new techniques, such as automation and the
    acquisition and storage of new types of library materials,
    including audio-visual materials.
