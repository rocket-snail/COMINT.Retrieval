on the approximate daytime constancy of the absorption of
    radio waves in the lower ionosphere the lower part of the d
    layer is due to photo detachment of electrons from negative
    ions the concentration of which is large and nearly constant
    from day to night the optical depth is small for the photo
    detachment radiation but large for the radiation which can
    ionize neutral particles
