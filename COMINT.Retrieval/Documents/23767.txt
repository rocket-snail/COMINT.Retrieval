some novel circuits employing cold cathode tubes the
    circuits described are based on cold cathode diodes and triodes
    the diode being used to stabilize the anode breakdown voltage
    of the triodes details are given of a stable relaxation
    oscillator a voltage discriminator trigger circuits a staircase
