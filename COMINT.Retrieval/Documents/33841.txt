the distribution of electrons in the undisturbed layer of
    the ionosphere the variation of electron density with height is
    deduced from records obtained at watheroo huancayo and slough
    and the form of the typical layer for magnetically quiet days
    is described in a series of curves detailed tabulated results
    are available at the cavendish laboratory
