effect of the surface on the magnetic properties of an
    electron gas the energy levels of free electrons confined in a
    finite cylindrical box with a uniform axial magnetic field are
    computed using the wkb approximation the form of approximation
    appropriate to various boundary conditions is discussed the
    results are used to calculate the susceptibility of the
    system
