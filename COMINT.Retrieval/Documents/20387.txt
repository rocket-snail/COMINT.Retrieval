library as a municipal information centre. a survey
    carried out in public libraries in sweden shows that most
    libraries obtain materials and information concerning local
    government matters. political parties and local organisations
    are not using libraries to display information. librarians
    themselves are passive about acquiring any materials on local
    affairs. only 14% of them had contacts with some local
    organisations. only 19 libraries made displays of local
    information. there is a need to develop the provision of local
    information in libraries.
