an automatic method for extracting significant phrases in
    scientific or technical documents. this method is based on text
    structure analysis and uses a relatively small dictionary. the
    dictionary is based on knowledge of scientific and
    technological concepts and on some lexical knowledge. text
    analysis is used to select significant phrases as substantial
    and semantic information carriers of the contents of the
    abstract. results of an experiment on 5 sets of documents
    indicate that significant phrases are effectively extracted
    within a satisfactory processing time.
