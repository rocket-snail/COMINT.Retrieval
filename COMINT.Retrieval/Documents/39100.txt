integrated magnetic circuits for synchronous sequential
    logic machines two approaches to the problems of storage gain
    and unidirectional transfer of a sequence of bits in a system
    with a minimum of nonmagnetic components are outlined examples
    are given of experimental synchronous sequential circuits using
    commercially available multiaperture cores
