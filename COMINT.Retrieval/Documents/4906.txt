archival training in europe. overview of archival
    training in europe presenting a fresh perspective on us
    practice. the very antiquity of the european archival
    profession has seen its constant transformation in response to
    changing historical and cultural conditions. europeans, more
    than americans, traditionally stressed the archivist's dual
    responsibility as custodian and interpreter of the historical
    record. american archivists should not slavishly imitate the
    practices of european countries, but rather garner the insights
    broader than an exclusively american-oriented discussion can
    provide.
