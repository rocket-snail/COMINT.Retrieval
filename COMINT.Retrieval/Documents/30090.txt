frequency modulation noise in oscillators the discussion
    is confined to noise due to the discrete nature of the electron
    and the random motion of the electrons in the oscillator valve
    the spectrums ranges from zero to hundreds of the effect of the
    usual band pass filter on the noise modulation is determined
    and the power spectrum of the oscillator output is evaluated
    the theory is applied to several types of oscillator
