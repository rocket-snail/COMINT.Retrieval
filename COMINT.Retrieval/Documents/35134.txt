minimum noise figure of the variable capacitance
    amplifier a discussion of the minimum noise figure of variable
    capacitance diode amplifiers on the assumption that the series
    resistance is the only parasitic element some experimental
    figures are given for dsb operation at and universal curves are
    included which illustrate the effect of changing network
    parameters and component temperatures
