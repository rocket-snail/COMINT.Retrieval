a name for every chemical. describes the confused state
    of chemical nomenclature and outlines the solutions used by
    data banks. chemical abstracts service uses rigid nomenclature
    rules and assigns a unique 'registry number' to each chemical.
    the national institutes of health and the environmental
    protection agency have assembled a group of data banks, each
    based on a collection of chemicals, into the integrated
    chemical information system which may be searched by registry
    number, systematic names, some trivial names, and structures
    'drawn' by the user at the terminal. some data banks and many
    research-based organisations use the wiswesser line notation,
    an alphanumeric linear notation.
