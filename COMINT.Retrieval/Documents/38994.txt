kbf has got 10,000 (kroner) towards a pilot project on
    work environment and automation. in june 80 the norwegian
    ministry of municipal affairs and employment granted the
    association of municipal library workers (kbf) funds for a
    pilot project to investigate possible grounds for more extended
    research on work environment, automation and the library. the
    association has pointed out that previous reports on
    computerisation in libraries ignored problems of working
    conditions and employment, and that the employees'
    organisations should take the initiative in investigating them.
    they aim to chart problems arising from the introduction of
    computerisation in (1) working conditions-physical, job
    structure and development, staff/reader relations; (2)
    potential influence of employees on planning and introduction
    of computer systems; (3) employment and finance' will
    automation free staff for other work or lead to dismissals? and
    will the expense of computerisation mean cuts in other aspects
    of librar y service?.
