the electric properties of a dielectric with a variable
    number of relaxation centres expressions are derived for
    permittivity and of dielectric loss tangent it is shown that
    the number of ions and dipoles which give rise to relaxation
    polarization increases with temperature leading to an increase
    of permittivity
