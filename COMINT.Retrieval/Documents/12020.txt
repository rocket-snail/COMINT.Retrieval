a model of solar flare induced ionization in the d region
    the energy distribution of the x radiation in the range was
    estimated from rocket measurements during a class flare on
    august simultaneous measurements of cosmic noise at showed the
    changes in d layer absorption during the flare the absorption
    can be accounted for by assuming a recombination coefficient of
    about and an electron density profile which varies linearly
    from at
