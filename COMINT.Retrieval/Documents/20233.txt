parallel t rc selective amplifiers the operation of a
    less familiar form of selective amplifier with low impedance
    input is analysed in which the signal is injected at the null
    point of the parallel t network in the feedback loop design
    equations are derived and applied as an example to a fixed
    tuned amplifier with a square wave input
