observations of galactic radiation on a wave length of cm
    report of measurements made using the wurzburg mirror at
    marcoussis results are presented in the form of an isophot map
    of the galaxy with intensities expressed as apparent
    temperature in arbitrary units the cm radiation is attributed
    principally to ionized hydrogen a table giving the positions of
    localized sources includes five thought to have been observed
    for the first time
