warner-lambert/parke-davis-cas registry iii integrated
    information system. the chemical abstracts service (cas)
    registry iii records of chemical structure are used to augment
    the warner-lambert/parke-davis (wl/pd) computer files of
    chemical and biological data. entry of data at wl/pd is
    paralleled by entry of chemical structures and names at cas,
    which then sends the computer-readable records to wl/pd. wl/pd
    uses inquire software which provides interactive or batch
    multifile search capabilities and routine report generation.
    batch processing is used for substructure searching and
    high-quality printing of structures and names.
