angular diameter measurements of the radio sources cygnus
    and cassiopeia on a wavelength of cm results given in each case
    for two directions at right angles show that cassiopeia is
    circularly symmetrical and approximately the same size at metre
    wavelengths while cygnus is markedly asymmetrical with a major
    axis which may be slightly larger at the shorter wavelength the
    position angle of this major axis is is measurement equipment
