rocket measurements of absorption in the lower ionosphere
    results are given of measurements of the field strength of one
    long wave and two medium wave transmitters the d layer minimum
    height is about km and medium wave observations indicate
    maximum absorption at km the attenuation being km for normal
    incidence
