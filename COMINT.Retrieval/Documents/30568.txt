the resistance of sheets strips wires tubes and coils of
    various materials at frequencies between a method of
    calculation applicable to materials with widely different
    conductivities ranging from is presented the values of the
    resistance per square are found from sets of curves for
    material thicknesses of because of skin effect at high
    frequencies the curves for these thicknesses cover all
    requirements
