the principle of stabilization of constant impedance
    devices n and its application to a transistor power supply the
    useful operating range of a shunt type voltage regulator is
    expressed in terms of a utilization coefficient general
    relations derived are applied to a two transistor circuit of
    the type described earlier of november particularly suitable
    for stabilization of valve heater supplies
