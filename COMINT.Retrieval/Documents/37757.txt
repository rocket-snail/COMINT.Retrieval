    national bibliography. prepared by the ifla international
    office for universal bibliographic control, these guidelines
    are intended to help all countries to improve national
    bibliographic control through the production of a
    regularly-appearing national bibliography in accordance with
    international standards and practices. they also offer
    practical guidance on the preparation of national bibliographic
    records, the production of the national bibliography, and the
    administrative machinery required (i.e. the role and functions
    of the national bibliographic agency).
