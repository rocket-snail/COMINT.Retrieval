transistor frequency standard this unit designed
    primarily for geophysical prospecting has a printed circuit
    base and uses transistors in all stages accuracy is within part
    in over the range f to f an oscillator is followed by a pulse
    forming amplifier and first divider stage then by two dividers
    in parallel whose outputs are mixed to obtain an u output
    frequency of cs
