transistor converters a transistor in a relaxation
    oscillator is arranged to interrupt a circuit energy is stored
    in the transformer inductance during the on period and is
    delivered to the output circuit at an increased voltage during
    the off period the circuit thus acting as a step up device
    design and operation of practical arrangements are discussed a
    shorter account of the work is given in wireless world
