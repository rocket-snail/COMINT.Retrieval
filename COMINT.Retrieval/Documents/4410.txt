classification of homosexuality. criticises the placing
    of 'homosexuality' in 2 classification systems, dewey
    (norwegian subject index 1979) and arnesen, the norwegian
    version of dewey (subject index 1969). both make the untenable
    assumption that homosexuality is by definition a sexual
    deviation. in recent years homosexual organisations have won
    some sympathy for their view of homosexuality as a way of life
    as valid as heterosexuality, but this aspect is not represented
    in the tables. even the most neutral placing, 301.45
    minorities, has overtones of inferiority and
    discrimination.
