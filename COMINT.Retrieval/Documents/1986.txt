access to federal documents in small non-depository
    academic libraries. 50 small academic libraries not housing
    federal depositories were surveyed to determine how well they
    can meet users' needs for federal documents. results indicate
    these libraries spend an average of about $750 a year on
    documents, acquire very little free material, and incorporate
    most documents into the regular collection or the vertical
    file. although most acquire the basic document reference
    sources and bibliographic tools, very few make any significant
    use of interlibrary loan. apparently most cannot provide access
    to documents equal to that offered by even small
    depositories.
