nonlinear distortion including cross modulation in high
    frequency transistor stages harmonic distortion and cross
    modulation are calculated for the earthed base transistor
    treated as a nonlinear quadripole and assuming low current
    densities the solutions obtained are applied to the earthed
    emitter configuration and experimental results of tests on
    earthed emitter circuits confirm the theory even for relatively
    high collector currents an interpretation is given of a
    pronounced minimum in cross modulation depth as a function of
    collector current
