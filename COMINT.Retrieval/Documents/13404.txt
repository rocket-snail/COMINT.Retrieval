the 10th anniversary of the netherlands bibliotheek en
    lektuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and literature).
    text of an interview with dick reumer, director of the
    nederlands bibliotheek en lektuur centrum, on the 10th
    anniversary of the founding of the centre. reumer believes that
    the most important problems facing libraries in the netherlands
    in 1982 are the government's decision to reduce subsidies to
    public libraries by 15% and the proposed legislation relating
    to the public services, which will replace the present public
    library act. for the nblc the new legislation will mean the
    decentralisation of library services throughout the regions and
    closer cooperation amongst libraries in the same area. to
    celebrate the 10th anniversary of the nblc a jubilee congress
    is to be held at which the centre's services will come under
    close examination and will be more actively promoted to the
    public.
