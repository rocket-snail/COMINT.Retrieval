the cataloguing of music manuscripts in old bavaria and
    swabia. through the dissolution of the monasteries in 1803,
    bavarian libraries acquired many music manuscripts, mainly of
    choral and instrumental works from about 1750 onwards. since
    1958 renewed efforts at cataloguing have been made, with help,
    since 1964, from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft (german
    research association) and the bavarian state library. since
    1971 3 catalogue sections have been published and others are in
    course of preparation. the catalogues are important since this
    type of music is rarely found in public collections; brief
    biographies of little-known composers are included. the
    collection also includes early works by well-known composers
    such as mozart and michael haydn. 3 collections owned by noble
    families and some material belonging to the nation are also
    recorded. the 6 volumes already published of the 2catalogue of
    bavarian music collections1 are described.
