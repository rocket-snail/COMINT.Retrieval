the irregular structure of the outer regions of the solar
    corona records obtained in of the radiation from the radio star
    in taurus of machin and smith and results of measurements made
    in june using aerials of greater directivity cannot be
    explained in terms of absorption or large scale refraction
    effects in the solar corona or large scale refraction effects
    in the solar corona but are consistent with a scattering theory
    an estimate is made of the size and the electron density of the
    coronal irregularities in the range of distance where is the
    solar radius the irregular structure may represent an extension
    of the visible coronal rays
