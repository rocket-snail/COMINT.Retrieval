calculation of transient phenomena in electrically short
    networks by means of fourier integrals fourier integrals are
    applied to the determination of the frequency spectra of
    periodic functions nonperiodic functions including step
    functions the results are used in discussion of the distortion
    and initial conditions in networks to which an impulse voltage
    is applied
