recommended standards for public library services: a more
    detailed explanation. in the netherlands the recommended
    standards for public libraries have recently been published by
    the kommissie koordinatie normering. the committee was formed
    in 1977 to consolidate and expand the standards proposed at the
    meeting of the nederlands bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch
    centre for libraries and literature) in mar of that year. the
    comittee has been criticised for the omission of a theoretical
    basis to the report. however, as these are the first standards
    to be published, the committee hopes that they will form the
    theoretical basis in future discussions. it also intends to
    incorporate the criticism levelled at the report in a future
    revision.
