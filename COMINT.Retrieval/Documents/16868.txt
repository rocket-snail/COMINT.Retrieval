induced and spontaneous emission in a coherent field the
    interaction between the electromagnetic field and a number of
    identical atomic systems individually characterized by an
    electric dipole moment and tow energy levels is analysed for
    the case where the atomic systems are inside a lossy cavity and
    exposed to a coherent driving field resonance being assumed
    between atomic system cavity and driving field
