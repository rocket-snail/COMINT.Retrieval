growth of electric space charge and radio waves in moving
    ion streams in a medium comprising two identical
    interpenetrating ion streams four different space charge
    phenomena may occur two of these are discussed an instability
    described as a growing ion cloud this is thought to be the
    basic mechanism of a two stream amplifier and to be important
    in solar rf emission an evanescent wave sometimes wrongly
    interpreted as a spatially growing wave see of and back
