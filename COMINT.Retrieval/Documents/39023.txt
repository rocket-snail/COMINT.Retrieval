contribution to the study of a rectifier in series with
    an inductive resistance different hypotheses are considered for
    expressing the voltage drop across the rectifier at low
    frequencies values of mean and maximum current are calculated
    according to each hypothesis and compared with vith values
    measured using a coil of inductance and resistance in series
    with a valve rectifier a circuit for measuring low peak
    voltages using a gas filled tetrode is described
