programming in public libraries' a dissenting viewpoint.
    the original purpose of programming (the offering on non-book
    activities in public libraries) has been forgotten by many
    librarians, but has been justified in several ways. advocates
    that the commonest method is not to justify it at all; in many
    cases programming is ineffective, and little rigorous
    evaluation has ever been undertaken to prove that programming
    can succeed. questions the common unthinking acceptance of the
    need for programming, and cites annual reports and studies
    which indicate the need for better evaluation than has
    heretofore been the practice.
