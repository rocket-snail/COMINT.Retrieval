diffraction at a circular aperture a discrepancy in the
    results obtained by two methods of calculating the diffraction
    field described earlier and of is examined the first method is
    correct within the approximation stated the second is invalid
    for a small region near the centre of the aperture when the
    wavelength is insufficiently small
