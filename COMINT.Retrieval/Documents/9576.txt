medical libraries' changes between 1970-1978 and
    conditions in 1979. statistical analysis of hungarian special
    libraries including the national library and university
    libraries was carried out in 1970, 1974, and 1978. from the
    average of 100 special libraries 13 were medical libraries.
    holdings in the analysed special libraries amounted to 28.5
    million volumes in 1970, to 43.6 million in 1974, and to 51.5
    million volumes in 1978. increases 1970-74 amounted to 15
    million volumes while acquisitions decreased to 8 million
    volumes 1974-78. comparison with other data revealed that
    during the early 70s holdings in local, institutional,
    libraries had been augmented to a larger extent than in the 2nd
    half of the decade. the same trend was valid for the 13 medical
    libraries.
