theory of the thermistor as an electric circuit element a
    study of thermistor circuits fundamental relevant physical and
    mathematical concepts are presented the dissipated poer rather
    than the thermistor temperature is taken as th basic variable
    the power balance equation is presented in a form introducing
    the thermal time constant and is used to develop equivalent
    circuits for thermopositive and thermonegative resistors
    permitting calculation of superposed variable states
