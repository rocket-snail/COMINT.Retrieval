solar enhanced radiation and plasma oscillations the
    dispersion formula for plasma oscillations in a static magnetic
    field is derived by the laplace transform method used by landau
    of the oscillations are unstable in frequency bands around
    multiples of the gyrofrequency numerical calculations for
    sunspot magnetic fields in the corona indicate that random
    fluctuations may be amplified and afford support for the
    explanation given by wild of enhanced radiation
