hydromagnetic resonance in ionospheric waves the large
    scale travelling ionospheric disturbances detected by various
    workers in the layer may be partially explained as an electron
    resonance effect produced when an initial atmospheric
    disturbance generates natural modes of electromagnetic
    oscillation as a result of hydromagnetic coupling
