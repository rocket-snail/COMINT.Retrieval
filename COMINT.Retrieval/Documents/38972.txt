bibliographic access to curriculum guides. curriculum
    guides are an important and heavily used resource in education
    libraries and instructional materials centres. gaining access
    to these materials, however, has been difficult and
    time-consuming, as most curriculum guides have not
    traditionally been indexed in a central source. fearon-pitman
    publishers inc. has attempted to remedy this situation by
    publishing the curriculum development library, the 1st set of
    which contained 905 curriculum guides on microfiche with hard
    copy indexes. the publisher expects to publish this set on an
    annual basis. the university of missouri-st. louis owns the
    curriculum development library, and the author describes its
    use in the education library.
