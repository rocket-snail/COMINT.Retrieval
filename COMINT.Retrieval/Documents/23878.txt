answer-passage retrieval by text searching. passage
    retrieval (already operational for lawyers) has advantages in
    output form over reference retrieval and is economically
    feasible. previous experiments in passage retrieval for
    scientists have demonstrated recall and false retrieval rates
    as good or better than those of present reference retrieval
    services. the present experiment involved a greater variety of
    forms of retrieval question. in addition, search words were
    selected independently by 2 different people for each retrieval
    question. the search words selected, in combination with the
    computer procedures used for passage retrieval, produced
    average recall ratios of 72 and 67%, respectively, for the 2
    selectors. the false retrieval rates were (except for 1
    predictably difficult question) respectively 13 and 10 falsely
    retrieved sentences per answer-paper retrieved.
