delay line subcarrier discriminator the frequency
    discriminator described uses a multivibrator triggered by the
    direct input signal and stopped by the delayed signal producing
    pulses whose spacing is a function of signal phase designed
    primarily for telemetering it is useful also for automatic
    correction of wow and flutter in tape recorders
