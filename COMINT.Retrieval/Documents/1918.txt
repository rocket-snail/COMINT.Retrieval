active high frequency spectrometers for ionospheric
    sounding part direct recording of ionospheric characteristics
    on the basis of the method noted earlier of equipment has been
    designed which provides direct records of and as a function of
    time sample records are reproduced and applications of the
    method are discussed a method of distinguishing height ranges
    in f layer records using colour film is noted
