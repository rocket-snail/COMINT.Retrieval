elimination of waiting time in automatic computers with
    delay type stores a critical survey is made of methods which
    have been tried for eliminating waiting time and a description
    is given of a process developed for determining the amount of
    waiting time eliminated the optimum programming method adopted
    with the ace pilot model is found to be a combination of
    several methods it appears that reduction of waiting time
    generally has to be paid for in extra complication of
    programming or design some exceptions to this rule are
    indicated
