the israeli national medical library's new
    minicomputerized on-line integrated system (maimon). an
    in-house library system, based on a dedicated minicomputer, has
    been in operation in israel's national medical library since
    summer 79. the integrated system, called maimon, features
    on-line access to bibliographic and circulation records. it
    replaces manual cataloguing, searching, lending, and
    reservations. it provides previously-unavailable statistics on
    items in heavy use and demand, items to be removed from the
    active collection, and who uses what in the library. it is
    designed to be user-friendly and to save users' time. it has
    been very favourably received by patrons and frees professional
    staff from time-consuming routine clerical tasks. the system is
    evaluated in terms of performance, convenience, and
    cost.
