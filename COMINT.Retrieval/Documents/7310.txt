an active factor in the progress/development of the
    bulgarian nation. when interviewed about achievements,
    priorities and problems of the cyril and methodius national
    library in sofia, its director emphasises the importance of
    information obtained through books, especially in the field of
    science and technology, for the country's progress. although
    the information needs of a small country like bulgaria are
    almost the same as those of the large country, the former must
    be much more selective and carefully budgeted because of its
    limited financial resources in general, and particularly in
    foreign currencies. the national library's book collection is
    in fact, open to the whole country by means of interlending. it
    has the main responsibility for publishing the bulgarian
    national bibliography, computerisation of which has gradually
    been introduced. extension of the present building,
    construction of a depository library together with overall new
    investment will allow the library to meet the incr easing
    demands on its services and help to maintain standards.
