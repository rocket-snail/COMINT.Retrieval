theoretical considerations regarding the day glow results
    of rocket observations made by miley et al are examined the
    reported great altitude and luminosity of the emissive source
    cannot be reconciled with the assumption that dayglow is due to
    direct photo action by incident solar radiation a determination
    is made of the emission to be expected from processes known to
    be operative including resonant and fluorescent scattering
    photo dissociation photo ionization and recombination
