there is still much to be done. centralisation is
    practically complete in rsfsr (russian soviet federate of
    socialist republic). in 1980, 2,200 centralised library
    systems, (cls), operated in russia, uniting 50,000 libraries.
    but problems of acquisitions and stock-exploitation hamper cls.
    many central libraries complain of a deterioration of
    acquisitions, especially of fiction and children's literature.
    book-ordering departments do not fulfil cls orders, but dump
    unwanted books on them. relations between booksellers and
    libraries need overhauling. booksellers should be rewarded for
    fulfilling libraries' book orders. increased fines may prevent
    loss of books. cls need binding equipment for book repairs and
    should improve book use by intra-system book-exchange, thus
    improving service to rural libraries. librarians need higher
    specialised education to equip them for
    reading-guidance.
