some properties of concentrated and dilute heisenberg
    magnets with general spin the constant coupling approximation
    is used to obtain the thermodynamic properties of a heisenberg
    ferromagnet above the transition temperature and the
    dependendence of these properties on magnetic concentration in
    an alloy is c considered z antiferromagnets are also
    discussed
