energy levels of conduction electrons in a magnetic field
    the energy levels can be obtained simply if the spherical
    approximation is made for the band structure the free energy
    due to small departures from this assumption may be estimated
    using perturbation theory inclusion of spin orbit coupling
    gives the factor as a function of position in the band
