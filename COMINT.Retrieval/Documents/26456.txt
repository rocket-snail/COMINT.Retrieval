the distribution f minor ions in electrostatic
    equilibrium in the high atmosphere a simple discussion of the
    factors which govern the distribution of ions in diffusive
    equilibrium the scale height of the predominant ions is twice
    that of the corresponding neutral constituent and the
    concentration of a minor light ion can increase with
    altitude
