the involvement of multinational companies in the book
    industry in brazil. translation from english. multinational
    companies have been prominent in brazil in all fields of
    industry and commerce since the beginning of the century; their
    involvement in publishing began to increase notably with the
    expansion of higher education at the end of the 1950s. the
    progressive stages of growth up to the present are described,
    with details of the various ways in which such companies have
    penetrated the book industry and protective legislation
    designed to encourage national companies. brazilian firms are
    mainly hampered by lack of capital; strategies used to
    circumvent this problem are discussed. the multinationals
    currently established in book production are listed; many
    brazilians, however, are involved in these companies, while
    some multinationals are covertly involved in national
    companies. hence the division of the market between foreign and
    national producers is difficult to determine exactly.
