observations of cosmic noise at from observations made at
    a frequency of with an aerial of beam width between half power
    points and directed to a curve of equivalent aerial temperature
    as a function of sidereal time is derived the temperatures
    observed were of the order the curve is compared with curves
    derived for similar conditions by calculation from the results
    of observations at it is found that the equivalent temperatures
    increase rapidly with decreasing frequency but the ratio of
    maximum to minimum temperature decreases with frequency it is
    shown that atmospheric noise levels observed by the standard
    techniques sometimes contain a large contribution from cosmic
    noise at this frequency
