artemis' a system for document digitisation and
    teletransmission. this report describes a document delivery
    service, code name artemis, which prints out on readers'
    terminals the pages of scientific and technical documents
    requested from computer data bases. source documents are
    converted to computer readable form, either as text or as
    facsimile. the former can be printed on a teleprinter, but does
    not preserve all the format of the original; the latter can be
    delivered to a facsimile receiver. the digitised documents are
    stored in data bases attached to host computers. from these,
    they can be retrieved in response to user's request and sent
    overnight via euronet or another telecommunications network to
    the user's unattended terminal or to his computer for later
    printing.
