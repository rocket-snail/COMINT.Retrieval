theory of afc synchronization the performance of an afc
    system can be described in terms of three parameters the gain
    constant the damping ratio and the resonance or cut off
    frequency using these parameters expressions v for the
    performance under conditions of small disturbance to the input
    phase and for the pull in performance are derived two different
    types of control network transfer function being
    considered
