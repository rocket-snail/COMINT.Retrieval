harmonic generation and frequency mixing in ferromagnetic
    insulators calculations are made of second harmonic generation
    and second order frequency mixing for small ellipsoidal samples
    with loss included in the landau lifshitz form examples are
    given and a simple case of third harmonic generation is
    discussed detailed calculations are given elsewhere
