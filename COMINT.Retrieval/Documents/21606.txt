ionospheric records of solar eclipses the horizontal
    gradients of ionization produced during an eclipse introduce
    curvature into the isoinic contours so that the ionosonde
    soundings are effectively oblique the resultant errors in the
    deduced ion distributions assuming vertical soundings give rise
    to many of the apparent abnormalities in c eclipse
