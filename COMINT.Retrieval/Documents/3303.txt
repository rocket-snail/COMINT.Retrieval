youth, unemployment, and work with young adults. in the
    last 25 years one of the most critical areas affecting youth,
    but one of the least discussed in the library profession, is
    high unemployment. explores this topic, with a view to
    developing an approach that will serve as a model for an
    extended study in this and other areas seriously affecting the
    lives of youth. discusses the dimensions of the us unemployment
    problem, the evolution of government programmes developed to
    deal with it, and a definition of the role of libraries in
    relation to it.
