applications of nonlinear magnetics it is shown how
    saturable core reactors may be used in such applications as
    counters timers voltage and current references frequency
    multipliers firing circuits for thyratrons and ignitrons pulse
    shaping circuits for magnetrons rectifying circuits bistable
    flip flops frequency detectors and square wave
    oscillators
