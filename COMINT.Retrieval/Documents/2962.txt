conceptual information retrieval. outlines recent
    research in natural-language processing carried out as part of
    the yale artificial intelligence project; discusses the 4 key
    issues to be addressed in designing a system able to organise
    and retrieve facts in relatively unconstrained domains
    (organising memory, analysing input text, automatically
    updating memory, and answering questions); and describes the
    project's computer system, cyfr. cyfr comprises 2 systems.
    frump (fast reading understanding and memory program) reads
    stories from the united press international news wire and
    outputs a conceptual representation of the important events of
    each story it understands. conceptual summaries concerning the
    us secretary of state are sent to cyrus, which fills in
    contextual details, adds new information to its data base, and
    can then be interrogated about the new information.
