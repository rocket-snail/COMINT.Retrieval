qualification of librarians and information scientists.
    having mentioned briefly the importance of libraries to
    society, and also courses offered for prospective non-graduate
    and graduate librarians and information scientists in slovakia,
    discusses continuing education and in-service training of
    library and information centre staff. since 1976, the said
    concept has enjoyed official backing by regulations issued by
    the slovak ministry of culture. the regulations are binding on
    all central and other major libraries. so far, the most
    important training projects have been launched by matica
    slovenska and by the slovak technical library. in-service
    courses should not only include lectures, but also work in
    seminars and smaller groups. visits to selected libraries and
    discussions with their staff stimulate the exchange of views
    and ideas. films and other illustrative materials must be used
    more fully. graduates, continuing their studies abroad, must be
    encouraged to concentrate on topical proble ms, and to aim at
    posts with responsibility. users of library and information
    services have to be educated and trained, too, to make the best
    of the resources available. starting with undergraduates, the
    scheme must be expanded to involve the whole nation in
    future.
