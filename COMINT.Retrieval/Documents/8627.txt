    cosmic ray measurements show that a forbush decreases are not
    dependent on the presence of the earths field as they occur out
    in space b solar flare particles producing polar cap absorption
    are not stored in the geomagnetic field and c solar production
    of energetic electrons is not restricted to periods of flare
    activity
