on the resolving time and flipping time of
    magnetoresistive flip flops the time constant of the
    exponential approach to the stable states is shown to be a fair
    approximation for the flipping time of a bridge type
    magnetoresistive flip flop is of the order for materials at
    present available the method of calculating flipping time is
    extended to more general networks and the dependence of the
    flipping time on t e incoming pulse is considered
