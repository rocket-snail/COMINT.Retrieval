survey of the periodical stock at the library of the
    institute of public health. the growth of the hungarian
    institute of public health's objectives and research team, the
    lack of space and the rise in journal prices induced the
    librarians to examine the usage of journals. they wished to
    establish journals which need not be subscribed to any longer;
    journals which could be placed in remote storage; and journals
    which readers regularly require but which are not available in
    the library. data were collected from 1 nov 77 -30 apr 78. as a
    result of the investigation it can be laid down that the
    library can comply, from its own stock, with a large part of
    readers' demands for journals. the smaller part (29%) of the
    stock fulfils 77% of demands, the larger proportion is little
    used. the number of journals not used at all is small. journals
    used less will be put in distant stacks; current journals and
    often used volumes will be stored in the library.
