transistor characteristic parameters for weak alternating
    currents a method of representation is proposed using an
    impedance matrix which is completely symmetrical for all six
    transistor connections formulae derived for input impedance
    current gain etc have the same form for all the six circuits
    the method requires a new definition of the currents and
    voltages but affords the possibility of extension to
    multielectrode systems the setting up of matrices for complex
    arrangements of resistors and transistors is illustrated
