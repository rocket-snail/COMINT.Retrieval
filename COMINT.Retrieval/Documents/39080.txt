ionospheric drifts at brisbane measurements over a year
    period show that speeds are less than those observed at higher
    altitudes the e region and solar harmonics show large seasonal
    phase changes in the northward component the phase for the
    northward component in summer is in fair agreement with higher
    latitudes the f region harmonic seasonal change is greater in
    the eastward than in the northward component
