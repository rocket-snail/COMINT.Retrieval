numeric databases: too many or not enough statistical
    data?. historically the 1st numerical data bases were organised
    to meet a specific demand by supplying economists with basic
    statistical data together with computerised tools in order to
    manipulate the retrieval data. data were gathered from any
    standard or readily-available source. some very usable data
    bases were sold by their producers to be offered to on-line
    searchers. many data bases display strong similarities,
    offering the same information, while in other fields, for many
    countries, information is scarce if at all available.
