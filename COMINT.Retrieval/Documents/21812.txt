experimental studies of the motions of slow electrons in
    air with application to the ionosphere from experiments on the
    motion of slow electrons in air empirical formulae were deduced
    from which the electronic temperature collision frequency drift
    velocity and the average energy loss per collision ca can be
    derived the collision cross section of molecules of air and
    nitrogen at electron temperatures up to is directly
    proportional to the speed of the electrons the electron
    collision frequency in the ionosphere up to is linearly
    proportional to the pressure the important result that is
    proportional to and not to as believed hitherto where q is the
    agitational energy of the electron and q the energy of thermal
    agitation of the gas molecule is discussed briefly
