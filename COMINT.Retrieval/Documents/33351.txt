a new method for obtaining electron density profiles from
    records a practical and accurate method for reducing records to
    electron densities true height is described and used to analyse
    records taken at white sands direct measurements of electron
    densities in the ionosphere obtained with the aid of rockets
    are used to check the methos obtained by these two independent
    techniques are shown to be in excellent agreement twenty
    records were reduced for the period from all of which reveal a
    considerable degree of regularity in the height of the daytime
    and regions some of the profiles obtained are shown one of the
    illustrations shows a one hour sequence where the virtual
    height varied from whereas the true height remained essentially
    unchanged
