all library service should be free of charge. in the bill
    for a new danish library act, which will shortly be tabled in
    the folketing, the clause regarding a free library service
    will, it seems, be retained. questions whether the parties who
    believe that a charge should be levied for library use will
    manage to influence the final form of the act. if the principle
    of a free service goes by the board, every idea of an equal
    service to all will go by the board with it, with the
    consequent bad effect on publishing houses, bookshops and
    authors.
