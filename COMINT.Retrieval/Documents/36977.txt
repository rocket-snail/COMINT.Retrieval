effects of the solar eclipse of february on the
    ionospheric f region over equatorial africa detailed note of
    effects observed in ionosphere soundings at bangui these are
    interpreted satisfactorily in terms of the existence of two
    interspersed layers x and g comprising the f region the lower x
    disappears as ionization decreases during occultation during
    the reionization process which occurs more rapidly at the base
    of the layer than at the top the lower regions of x merge with
    the f layer the comparative insensitiveness of the upper layer
    g can be explained on the basis of corpuscular radiation
