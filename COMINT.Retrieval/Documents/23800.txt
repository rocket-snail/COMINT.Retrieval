microfiche as a vehicle for technical reports. the
    national institute of justice is interested in the possibility
    of improving the cost effectiveness of their information
    dissemination programme by making a larger part of the
    dissemination in microfiche instead of paper copy. they
    commissioned this study on an interagency agreement to help
    them decide whether microfiche dissemination would have the
    desired effect. the report concludes that, as presently used,
    most of the advantages of microfiche accrue to the producer,
    and most of the disadvantages to the user. there is likely to
    be considerable resistance to broadening the use of fiche for
    the intended audience of criminal justice professionals.
    several alternatives are presented for lessening this problem,
    including emphasis on the role of libraries, promoting the
    availability of fiche-to-paper copiers, and using microfiche
    itself in innovative ways to facilitate information transfer,
    rather than as an attempt to duplicate the features o f a paper
    publication in a reduced size.
