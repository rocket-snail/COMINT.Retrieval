are mobile libraries a profitable means of providing
    literature for structurally weak areas?. literature provision
    for rural areas has always been difficult. a comparison between
    mobile and small village libraries shows that mobile libraries
    are, contrary to popular opinion, cheaper to run; they have
    larger and more frequently changed stocks and do not have to
    pay overheads for heating and lighting. village libraries
    cannot be cultural crystallisation centres if their stocks are
    inadequate. children are the main users of village libraries,
    which therefore stock mainly children's books. mobile libraries
    carry a larger proportion of adult material; fewer children's
    books are needed here since the children have access to good
    school libraries. good quality literature provision is always
    profitable and in contrast with village libraries, mobile
    libraries always have qualified staff. the travelling library
    is a good advertisement for library services.
