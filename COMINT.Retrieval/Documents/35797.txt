equations for the natural frequencies of coupled circuits
    from the quadripole viewpoint part theory previously given of
    is extended to the case of a six terminal network with both
    series and parallel connected resistance the biquadratic
    equation for a coupled system is expressed by two binomials one
    referring to the circuits uncoupled the other occupation
    binomial taking account of the coupling data two schemes for
    formulating this occupation factor and associated expressions
    probably cover all cases of coupling by a single
    resistor
