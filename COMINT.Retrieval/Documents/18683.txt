motion of a satellite around an unsymmetrical central
    body if a central body does not have an inversion centre the
    eccentricity of a satellite orbit varies periodically with low
    frequency and large amplitude details are worked out for a
    central body composed of a large spherical mass and a small
    point mass contained somewhere within it
