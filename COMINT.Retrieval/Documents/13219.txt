an integrated public/schools library system for malta.
    (fla thesis.) provides a plan to standardise development in the
    state-controlled public and school libraries in malta, over a
    10-year period, in light of the failure of the 7-year malta
    development plan to mention library development. stresses the
    fact that malta has a sufficiently well educated and
    appreciative population to embark on such a programme of
    integrated service and provision.
