indexes as estimates of the amount of information in the
    indexed material (in hebrew). examines indexes as a source of
    general information about the indexed material. defines the
    concepts of index-entry, index-base and index and concludes
    that an index is a group of data and subjects which the indexer
    deemed significant and as expressing the content of the indexed
    material. given an ideal indexer, the size of an index may
    serve as a measurement of the amount of information in the
    indexing-base. since perfect indexes do not exist, a careful
    evaluation of a concordance by vocabulary size and word
    occurrence could provide an estimate. evaluation must be done
    very carefully in relation to content, discipline and type of
    indexed terms.
