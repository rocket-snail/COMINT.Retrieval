the use of radio stairs to study irregular refraction of
    radio waves in the ionosphere information from various sources
    on the amplitude and phase scintillation of radio star
    radiation is reviewed and the experimental data compared with
    theory there is general agreement on most but not all of the
    characteristics of the scintillation and its variation with
    time and zenith angle the rate of scintillation increases under
    magnetically disturbed conditions there is good correlation
    with spread f ionospheric reflections and some with sporadic e
    reflections the scale of the irregularities causing the
    scintillation is of the order of a kilometre the most puzzling
    problem is the cause of the night time maximum in scintillation
