instabilities of a cylindrical electron hole plasma in a
    magnetic field the stability of an electron hole plasma
    carrying current parallel to a magnetic field is investigated
    instabilities are predicted and the calculated values of
    electric field magnetic field and lowest oscillation frequency
    are compared with available observations agreement is
    reasonably satisfactory
