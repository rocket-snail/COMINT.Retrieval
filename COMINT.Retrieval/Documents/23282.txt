a monochromatically ionized layer in a non uniformly
    recombinant atmosphere with applications to the d and e
    ionospheric regions the recombinance fo the atmosphere is
    assumed to be given by a term independent of height together
    with a term which varies exponentially with height a
    recombinance datum level is defined as that at which the two
    terms are equal and heights are measured from this level in
    scale height units the level of the absorption peak being when
    the suns zenith distance is or when the level of the electron
    peak and the height distribution of the electron density are
    considered for different values of and of particularly when the
    electron peak is always above the absorption peak and for it is
    always above the recombinance datum level the electron peak for
    when the absorption peak is below the recombinance datum level
    is about half way between the two the decrease of on the
    underside of the electron layer can be much less steep than for
    a chapman layer if the absorption peak is below the
    recombinance datum level the results for the model atmospheres
    considered are tentatively discussed with reference to the and
    ionospheric regions but their potential value may be realized
    only when better data for the region become available
