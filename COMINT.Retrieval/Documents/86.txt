cable library survey results. public service satellite
    consortium conducted a survey of academic libraries, in 1980,
    to study their data communications needs and services. 'cable
    libraries' (catvlib) were identified as libraries connected to
    local cable companies. a 2nd study aimed to determine to what
    extent a national satellite cable library network might already
    be in technical existence; how many libraries are presently
    connected to cooperative cable companies with satellite
    hardware and excess satellite receiver capacity and of that
    number, how many cable libraries would be interested in
    participating in satellite-assisted library services and
    teleconferencing.
