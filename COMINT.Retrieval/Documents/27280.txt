self oscillatory systems with two degrees of freedom at
    multiple frequencies mathematical analysis of the operation of
    an oscillator using two coupled tuned circuits resonating at
    frequencies one of which is an approximate multiple of the
    other expressions are derived for the oscillator frequencies
    and their instability as a function of the instability of the
    tuned circuits and the supply voltages
