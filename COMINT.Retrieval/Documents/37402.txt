electromagnetic scattering by an ellipsoid in the third
    approximation the method described in above is used to evaluate
    the first three terms of the power series in those in the term
    in vanishes because of the symmetry of the scattering body the
    result is expressed as the sum of two elliptic integrals which
    are functions of the three principal axes of the ellipsoid the
    special cases of the spheroid perfectly conducting ellipsoid
    perfectly conducting disk and of diffraction by an elliptical
    or circular hole in a perfectly conducting screen are
    considered
