the control of an information retrieval system's input
    flow. the 2 commonly-used parameters, batch accumulation time
    and batch size, are inadequate for effective control of an
    information retrieval system's input. a 3rd parameter is
    required to describe document input rate. suggests a definition
    for this parameter, based on the number of documents in each
    incoming group and the waiting time before a batch is
    completed, and names it 'document flow momentum'. describes a
    method for measuring it and gives examples of its use in the
    optimisation of information input performance.
