the seasonal anomalies in the f region the seasonal
    variations in noon critical frequency and in the occurrence of
    f layer bifurcation are ascribed to changes in the electron
    loss coefficient these are related to a seasonal variation in
    frequency of occurrence of travelling disturbances and a
    connection with atmospheric tides is proposed
