occultations of the crab nebula by the solar corona in
    june the distribution of radiation on days when the angular
    separation is less than ten solar radii is not consistent with
    a symmetrical scattering process better agreement is obtained
    by postulating the existence of scattering and regular
    refraction of comparable magnitude
