a suggestion for the electric conductivity of the upper
    atmosphere from an analysis of diurnal variations of
    terrestrial magnetism part diurnal variations of the electric
    field and electrical conductivity of the upper atmosphere are
    deduced from the observed variations of the geomagnetic
    field
