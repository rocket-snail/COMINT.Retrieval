notes on the gyrator problem the impedance transformation
    properties indicated by tellegen of as characteristic of the
    gyrator can also exist in ordinary quadripoles the peculiar
    nature of the gyrator is indicated by the sign of the output
    current different conventions used in representing quadripole
    currents and voltages are discussed it is proposed that the
    equations should be written in a way that takes into account
    the terminating impedances and the internal impedance of the
    source
