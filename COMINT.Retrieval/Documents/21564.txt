specification and unconstrained enumeration of
    conformations of chemical structures for computer-assisted
    structure elucidation. a symmetry group called the conformation
    symmetry group (cfsg) which provides a method of uniquely
    specifying molecular conformation based on an appropriate
    discrete bond property (such as rotameric state) is formulated.
    the method is applicable to entire chemical structures as well
    as substructures. the cfsg can be used to build a simple
    'acyclic' conformation generator and leads to a solution for a
    heretofore unsolved problem in conformation enumeration.
