limited gain operational amplifiers the effect of finite
    gain can be allowed for by assuming infinite amplifier gain and
    then adding fictitious elements to the feedback network to
    reduce the gain to its actual value this leads to a more
    convenient equivalent network of which simple examples are
    given
