use of the danish veterinary and agricultural library by
    direct library users and users of an online documentation
    service. as a result of a reduction in the acquisition budget
    the danish veterinary and agricultural library carried out an
    analysis of the present use of the library. this was done to
    determine which parts of the collection could be cut down
    without causing too much inconvenience to the suers. results
    showed that appproximately 85% of requests for journals were
    covered by approximately 7% of the current serials.
    approximately 30% of requests were for books. it was concluded
    that an efficient back-up service for an on-line documentation
    service could be provided by the library collection, the danish
    interlending library structure and scandinavian co-operation
    agreements. this back-up service is provided free of charge in
    exchange agreements. it was decided that a joint scandinavian
    union catalogue of foreign serials based on the isds file will
    be a valuable tool in the scan dinavian interlending
    systems.
