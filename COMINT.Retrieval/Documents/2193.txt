electroluminescence with nonsinusoidal fields experiments
    using pulses of rectangular sawtooth exponential form were made
    to supplement the information obtained by applying sinusoidal
    voltages of piper and williams the phosphor investigated was
    giving green and blue luminescent bands which were examined
    separately measurements were made of field and frequency
    dependence and decay law with square pulses only qualitative
    observations were made with the other waveforms a theoretical
    interpretation of the results is advanced
