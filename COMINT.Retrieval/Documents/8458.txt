slide rule computes radio refractive index of air details
    are given of methods developed at the national bureau of
    standards for computing atmospheric rf refractive indices from
    radiosonede meteorological data using special types of straight
    or circular slide rule the methods give adequate accuracy for
    almost any conditions likely to be encountered in the
    troposphere
