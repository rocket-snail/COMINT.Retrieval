theory of the work function of metals the polarizing
    action of individual electrons on the distribution of the
    remaining electrons in the conduction band is investigated by
    means of extended thomas fermi statistics and the effect on the
    magnitude of the work function is calculated in alkali metals
    the work function is determined largely by this polarization
    effect image force and only l slightly by the electrostatic
    double layer at the metal boundary
