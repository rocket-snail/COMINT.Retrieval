the measurement of the angular diameter of two intense
    radio sources an interferometer using post detector correlation
    is described and results of measurements of the diameter and
    structure of the radio stars cygnus a and cassiopeia a are
    given the interferometer operates on and uses aerials spaced at
    up to the remote aerial being connected via an radio link to
    the correlator
