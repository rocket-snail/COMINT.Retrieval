documentation specialists and quebec government policy on
    scientific and technical information. discusses recent quebec
    government proposals for establishing a national information
    network, and the reactions of the 2 chief quebec librarians
    associations, asted and cbpq. government policy as set forth in
    a recent white paper is outlined, and the responses from asted
    and cbpq summarised. the government intention to democratise
    science by education and popularisation is generally approved,
    but criticism is made of the proposed implementation
    procedures. in emphasising the necessity of local
    decision-making in the creation of information networks, the
    importance of telecommunications and a global orientation is
    being ignored.
