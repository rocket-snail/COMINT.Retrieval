an open system theory approach to library effectiveness.
    briefly discusses the measurement of library effectiveness
    using the open system theory of organisations and a model for
    evaluation of academic libraries appropriate to the open
    system. discusses the results of a 1955 research project in
    which they were used (evaluation of college libraries for
    accreditation purposes, by alan dale covey, stanford university
    edd dissertation) and makes suggestions for future research in
    this area.
