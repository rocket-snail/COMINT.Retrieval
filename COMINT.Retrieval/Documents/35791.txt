some issues in planning the work of centralised library
    systems. planning in the work of centralised library systems
    can be seen as the method by which the most favourable
    circumstances are created for the satisfaction of the demands
    of the local population for books and for information. planning
    procedures have had to change significantly as libraries have
    combined into centralised systems and recent experiences from
    libraries from all over the ussr can be compared. the
    introduction of long-term planning in this respect is
    particularly relevant.
