diffraction by apertures theoretical and experimental
    investigations are reported of the diffraction of plane em
    waves by circular and elliptical apertures in plane screens
    integral equations are derived for the distribution over te the
    apertures and the aperture transmission coefficient is
    determined by a variational method the closeness f of the
    agreement between experimental and theoretical results shows
    that the method is capable of providing good approximations to
    the actual field values the measurements were made in the band
    using an image plane technique
