ionization of gas by electrons a statistical analysis is
    made of the ionization produced by an electron when it is
    absorbed in hydrogen linear integral equations are obtained for
    the average number and the mean square fluctuations of the ion
    pairs these are evaluated approximately for high values of
    incident energy
