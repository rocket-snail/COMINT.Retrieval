the purchasing key' a method for programming and
    controlling collective purchasing. since the 1960s the
    centralisation of stock processing and advisory work on book
    selection has demanded rationalisation methods in library
    organisation. the use of purchasing key codes in dresden's
    large municipal library system is described. in a collective
    purchasing decision each participant can use the key to make
    decisions for the whole network; thus individual responsibility
    for literature provision becomes greater. using a key also
    ensures balanced stock proportions throughout the whole network
    and takes into account demands for time saving and for improved
    stock quality, thus offering an optimal solution for unifying
    stocks in a territorial network.
