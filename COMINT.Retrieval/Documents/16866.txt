using the text telephone-something for libraries?.
    describes the text telephone installed in landskrona public
    library early in 1981 for the use of the deaf and speech
    impaired. it consists of 3 units' an ordinary telephone, a
    keyboard used to type the text, and a screen monitor, which
    receives and transmits the text. the handicapped person needs
    also a signal relay, which transforms the audible telephone
    signals to visual signals, and he must be able to type as the
    keyboard is that of a standard typewriter. disabled people can
    contact others with similar equipment, but contact to an
    ordinary telephone requires a transformer. the telephone
    directory has special markings for text telephones. expansion
    of the service, which provides an opportunity to reach new and
    isolated groups, has been limited by lack of finance.
