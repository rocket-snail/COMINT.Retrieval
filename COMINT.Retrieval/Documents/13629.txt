latitude and diurnal variations of air densities from to
    as derived from the orbits of discoverer satellites an analysis
    of orbital information obtained from nine discoverer satellites
    shows that variations in air density between day and night in
    the region curves of daytime density plotted against height
    indicate the possibility of a region of local heating at which
    disappears at night
