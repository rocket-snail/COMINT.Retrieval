demagnetization coefficients of high permeability cores
    experimental determination of the dependence of demagnetization
    coefficients on geometrical dimensions of solid or laminated
    cores of rectangular cross section and solid or hollow
    cylindrical cores a semi empirical formula for calculating the
    demagnetization coefficient of cylindrical rectangular cross
    section and ellipsoidal cores is given and the calculated
    results are shown to be in good agreement with
    measurements
