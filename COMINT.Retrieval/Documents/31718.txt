distortion in pentode voltage amplifiers characteristics
    are given which show that for a fixed screen voltage the
    distortion varies rapidly with changes in grid bias whilst if
    the screen voltage is supplied via a series resistance there is
    a compensating action which maintains the distortion at an
    almost constant value
