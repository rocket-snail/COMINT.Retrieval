certain phenomena observed on coupling an oscillator and
    a tube of ionized gas introduced in the oscillator inductance
    an experimental study is reported in which an oscillator coil
    carrying a current surrounds an energized gas discharge tube
    the effects of the hf current on the discharge are considered
    in particular the luminous effects and the maintenance of the
    discharge after the energizing voltage is removed
