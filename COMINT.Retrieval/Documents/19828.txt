an accurate electroluminescent graphical output unit for
    a digital computer the unit is fabricated from a uniform layer
    of electro luminescent phosphor with parallel conducting strips
    on either side these sets of strips being at right angles to
    form a matrix of conductors a changing electric field between
    selected strips of both sets causes fluorescence at their
    intersection intersections are selected in turn and the pattern
    is recorded photographically details of some prototype matrices
    are given
