the efficiency of frequency multipliers using detector
    circuits an analysis is made of the harmonic frequency power
    obtainable in an oscillatory circuit connected to a generator
    via a detector whose characteristic is represented
    approximately by a hyperbola for harmonics of fourth and higher
    orders the calculations become very difficult it cannot be
    assumed that for any given harmonic the power is less than for
    the next lower harmonic
