radio observations of the lunar atmosphere the refraction
    occurring in the lunar atmosphere is estimated from
    observations at of the lunar occulation of the crab nebula on
    january the electron density at the moons surface is derived
    for an atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium and for a
    continuously escaping atmosphere
