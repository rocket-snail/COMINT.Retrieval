effect of random inhomogeneities on electrical and
    galvanomagnetic measurements a theoretical treatment is given
    in which the scale of inhomogeneities is supposed small
    compared with the specimen size but large compared with the
    mean free path and debye length comparison with exactly soluble
    cases shows the derived formulae to e valid for sizable
    fluctuations
