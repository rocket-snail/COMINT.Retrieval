theory of the propagation of waves in an electron beam an
    approximate theory is developed for the propagation of em waves
    in a waveguide filled with a dielectric when an electron beam
    passes through it it is assumed that electrons can move freely
    along the waveguide in the dielectric and that they form a beam
    completely filling it with certain assumptions the types and
    characteristics of the waves which can travel in such a system
    are determined for various conditions the results obtained can
    be generalized so as to cover the case of an arbitrary
    transmission line
