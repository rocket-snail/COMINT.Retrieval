a note on uniqueness proofs for boundary value problems
    in potential theory and steady heat conduction by allowing the
    boundary to tend to infinity in two directions and considering
    the problem in a semi infinite region it is possible to prove
    uniqueness by classical methods for a very large class of
    boundary conditions
