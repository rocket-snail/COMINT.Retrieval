core collections of journals for national interlending
    purposes. centralised national provision for interlending
    provides a better service than decentralised provision but can
    be difficult and expensive to implement, so partial
    centralisation should be considered. journals are specially
    suited to central collections. concentration of demand on a
    relatively small number of journals means that collections of
    7,000-8,000 titles could supply 80% of demand and 2,000 titles
    50% in many countries. there are however problems in
    identifying journals for core collections. bibliometric methods
    can be shown to be of little help. analysis of demand at the
    british library lending division indicates that rank lists are
    not very stable over time; and various factors such as language
    or stage of economic development will cause variations that
    make it difficult to apply core lists between countries (though
    it may be possible to allow for differences, especially if core
    lists based on current demand could be obtained from a number
    of different countries). once a core collection had been set
    up, it would have to attract sufficient requests to monitor
    demand and adjust its contents accordingly. if a comprehensive
    collection is not possible, limitation to certain subjects has
    advantages. as collections grow, additional journals will be
    cheaper to acquire, though the unit cost per request will still
    be lower for the journals in heaviest demand. concludes that
    the concept of core collections is sound, but further data are
    needed before the practical problems of setting up such
    collections can be properly assessed.
