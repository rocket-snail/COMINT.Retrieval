private and public sector responsibility for the
    collection, distribution and analysis of statistical data.
    statistical information is a vital national resource, and a
    more comprehensive effort needs to be made to review and
    control us federal statistical policy. the federal government
    collects statistical information for regulation, programme
    operation, policy analysis and information programmes.
    statistical policy must be effectively incorporated into
    legislative proposals and regulatory actions, with a
    statistical office remaining separate from other aspects of
    information policy. the government should take full advantage
    of computer and communications technology in its dissemination
    and use of statistical data, and private firms should engage in
    any and all analysis appropriate for the markets being served.
    federal government should not encroach upon activities which
    properly belong in the private sector.
