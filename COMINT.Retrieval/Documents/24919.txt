potential analog network synthesis for arbitrary loss
    functions a method of network design s described in which the
    appropriate potential problem is formulated on the basis of a
    given loss function by introducing continuous charge
    distribution on the complex frequency plane the technique of
    charge quantization is used to find the natural modes of the
    network function
