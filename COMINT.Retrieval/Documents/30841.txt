the evolution of the international information system on
    research in documentation (isorid). a reading of the available
    documents on the international information system on research
    in documentation (isorid), a joint unesco-fid operation,
    reveals that the system has met as yet unresolved stresses that
    hinder the effective contribution to the world community that
    this system was expected to make. a quantitative comparison
    with the us-based 2library and information services today1
    (list) is not kind to isorid and reflects the degree of
    difficulty that isorid has with its essentially cooperative
    basis for gathering data. the theoretical basis for an
    international register appears sound, but practicalities are
    hindering its effectiveness to the fields of documentation,
    information science, and librarianship.
