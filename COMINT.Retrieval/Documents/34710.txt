library needs of children attending self-help
    mother-tongue schools in london. 124 london mother-tongue
    'saturday schools' with 13,919 pupils were sent postal
    questionnaires; their teachers were interviewed; 200 children
    were questioned on their reading habits and library use; and
    public libraries were visited to assess their services to
    ethnic minorities, particularly children. 124 children read in
    their mother tongue; 121 had read a book in their mother tongue
    within the last few months; and 170 used public libraries.
    problems included lack of suitable books, language expertise in
    some library authorities, and school/public library contact.
    all concerned would benefit from more communication and
    cooperation.
