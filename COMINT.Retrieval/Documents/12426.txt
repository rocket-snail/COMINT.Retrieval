wieners theory of linear filtering wieners theory of
    introduces the concept of the optimum linear filter for use
    when signal and noise occupy the same frequency band this
    concept is examined without attempting to follow the complex
    mathematics of the original the discussion is limited to the
    extreme cases of zero lag and infinite lag filters which are
    appropriate respectively to telecommunication and automatic
    control systems a formula is derived for the transfer
    characteristic of the optimum filter for an input signal having
    the power spectrum with uniform random noise for the zero lag
    case the transfer characteristic is affected by consideration
    of phase frequency variations for the infinite lag case it is
    not for applications in which delay can be tolerated the
    infinite lag filter has the advantage of transmitting a much
    greater fraction of the input power the applicability of
    optimum filters is discussed
