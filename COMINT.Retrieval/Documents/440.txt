indexes to hebrew periodicals-a bibliography (in hebrew).
    there is a growing demand on the part of high-school and
    university students, as well as the general reading public, for
    information included in hebrew periodicals. it is surprising,
    therefore, how few editors have supplied their readers with
    cumulative indexes. notes 8 items-current and
    retrospective-which index more than 1 hebrew periodical. in the
    2nd section, lists 115 published cumulative indexes to hebrew
    periodicals and 6 more which exist only as card files in the
    judaica reading room of the jewish national and university
    library, jerusalem.
