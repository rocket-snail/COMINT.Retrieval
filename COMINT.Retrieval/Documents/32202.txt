the problem of expressing information need in a user's
    inquiry to an automatic information retrieval system. analyses
    the drawbacks of the traditional composition of a thematic
    inquiry in an automatic information retrieval system that does
    not provide for an adequate reflection of the specialist's
    information needs in an inquiry. shows that the relevant
    documents retrieved by the system in response to a
    traditionally-composed inquiry are not necessarily pertinent,
    since the criteria employed by the user when analysing and
    evaluating documents are not included in the inquiry text as
    retrieval characteristics. introduces the concepts of objective
    and subjective information needs and 'retrieval information
    need'. considers the problem of understanding the composition
    of pertinence criteria and their formulation in an inquiry.
    proposes the classification of pertinence criteria.
