complementary symmetry transistor circuits under normal
    bias conditions the current which flows in each lead to an
    electrode of a pnp transistor is the negative of the
    corresponding current in an npn transistor this is termed
    static symmetry the polarity of an input signal that will
    increase conduction in a pnp transistor is the opposite of that
    for an npn transistor this is termed dynamic symmetry circuits
    are described that use static symmetry dynamic symmetry both
    types of symmetry these include a stabilized direct coupled
    class a amplifier with a voltage gain of a pulse circuit which
    converts a half sine wave to pulses a class b power output
    circuit using four transistors with overall feedback and giving
    a gain of about db when working into a load and a television
    vertical deflection system with a class b output stage
    connected directly to the deflection yoke
