book preservation questions answered at conference.
    report on the findings of a conference, on book preservation
    sponsored by the council on library resources and the andrew
    mellon foundation. the need for further progress was
    emphasised, and it was agreed that there was a foundation on
    which to build. the conference participants concluded that it
    is reasonable to balance the physical durability of books and
    their intellectual and cultural worth. discussion topics
    included permanence and durability of paper, its availability
    and costs, categories of books and journals to be routinely
    manufactured on permanent and durable paper, promotion of
    alkaline and durable papers outside the us, and the possibility
    of manufacturing copies of books for libraries
    separately.
