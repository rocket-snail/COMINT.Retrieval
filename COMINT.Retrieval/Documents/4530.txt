design of rc wide band degree phase difference network
    the arrangement comprises two all pass networks as described by
    orchard the pole zero pairs are first determined so as to give
    the difference of phase shift over the frequency band and the
    networks are synthesized from the response functions thus found
    design procedure is detailed step by step and is illustrated by
    a numerical example notes on construction and alignment are
    included
