computer programs for analysis of bibliometric
    distributions. (msc dissertation-city university, london). a
    suite of computer programs is given for the analysis of author
    and journal productivity data. the programs were written using
    subprograms from the statistical package for the social
    sciences, where appropriate, and using the fortran programming
    language. the author productivity programs 1st process raw
    author productivity data (consisting of author codes and
    article numbers). then the weibull, negative binomial and 2
    forms of the lotka distribution are compared with the observed
    distributions of author productivity, using the chi squared and
    kolmogorov-smirnov goodness-of-fit tests. the journal
    productivity programs allow raw journal productivity data
    (consisting of journal codes and article numbers) to be
    processed. the processed data is used to plot bradford, yield
    formula and naranan graphs by computer. reasons for choosing
    these author and journal productivity distributions are g iven,
    and applications of the programs in other areas of
    bibliometrics are examined. finally, useful developments to the
    suite of programs are considered.
