the temperature of the f region of the upper atmosphere
    as deduced from ionospheric measurements chapmans theory has
    been extended to include the variation of an attachment like
    loss coefficient with height in the f region application of the
    theory to data obtained in the form of kelso distributions
    shows that the region may be regarded as isothermal
