existence of net electric charges on stars this
    hypothesis accounts for the known orders of magnitude and
    directions relating to a number of phenomena such as the
    magnetization of the earth and the outer van allen belt and
    leads te a simplle qualitative or semi quantitative explanation
    for others possible sources of the stellar net charge and
    possible criticisms of the hypothesis are discussed the
    simultaneous observation of radio star scintillations on
    different radio frequencies with increasing scintillation
    activity the amplitude and rate have distributions which
    contain discontinuities
