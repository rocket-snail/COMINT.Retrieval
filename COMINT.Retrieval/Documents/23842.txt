contribution to the problem of limiting values for
    semiconductor circuit elements the danger of exceeding the
    permissible voltage limits in series connected power rectifier
    elements is discussed this difficulty can be overcome by the
    use of parallel resistors or capacitors as shown in the reverse
    voltage time curves given
