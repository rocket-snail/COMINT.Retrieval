the future course of archival theory in the united
    states. archivists wishing to pursue the concept of archival
    theory must first define that concept and then weigh their
    definition against the work done in the field so far. one
    approach would be to consider theory as the development of
    universal laws, and to frame hypotheses in universal form and
    test them against the evidence. addresses the likely future
    trends in us archival theory against this background,
    concluding that there is hope for the profession if' (1) the
    profession itself realises that it is both a science and a
    craft; and (2) certain archivists make the move from the
    workplace to the academy as a permanent career commitment.
    there they must realign themselves with academic historians and
    others to produce a body of basic principles, a system of
    immutable laws-a litany of theory and dogma.
