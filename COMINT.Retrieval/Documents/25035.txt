on what basis have you organised this library since one
    cannot find anything in here? (a survey of users: information
    needs). asu-ryhma, a pilot working group on a finnish subject
    heading list carried out a survey in over 30 public libraries
    about the nature of enquiries in 1 month. 4,600 enquiries were
    listed. this figure includes enquiries over a longer period in
    some of the libraries. a large majority of the enquiries
    concerned non-fiction. the most popular subject areas were
    literature, law, music and handicrafts. on pages 114 and 115
    the types of enquiries are listed by broad classification. a
    finnish subject heading list is needed urgently because of the
    specific nature of many of the enquiries for which the
    classification scheme used in public libraries cannot
    cater.
