reading and recreational activities. criticises the
    conventional approach to reading in schools, where books are
    used essentially for didactic purposes. instead argues that the
    use of books should be geared to arousing interest in reading,
    and proposes the introduction of text-based games, serving the
    dual purpose of developing the capacity for reflective thought
    as well as leading the child to read with enjoyment. examples
    are given of 3 types of games for particular age groups, with
    full details of objectives, materials required, and
    procedure.
