ad hoc subcommittee on staffing report to the library
    advisory committee of the state council of the higher education
    for virginia. because the staffing formula mandated by
    virginia's state council of higher education yielded
    unrealistically low numbers of library personnel for the larger
    institutions and for multi-campus community colleges, the
    subcommittee on staffing of the library advisory committee was
    charged with developing a more suitable formula. generally, the
    subcommittee concluded that the basic formula developed by the
    state university of new york could be modified to suit the
    particular personnel needs of virginia's academic libraries,
    and that the definitions of all formula input variables should
    be reexamined and clarified where necessary. report not
