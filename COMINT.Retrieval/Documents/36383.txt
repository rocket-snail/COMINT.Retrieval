emilia-romagna' problems and prospects for libraries. a
    description of the present situation in a north italian
    province, where services are uncoordinated and unevenly
    distributed. drawing on an independent survey published in
    1979, gives details of the various library systems in
    operation, at regional and local levels' university, church,
    school, local and private. the inequality of service provision
    is demonstrated, and the need for a regional policy involving
    creation of new libraries and rationalisation of existing
    resources shown. the operation of urban library systems in
    bologna and modena is described, and the projected network
    service, based on designated library consortia, such as
    bologna-ferrara, is discussed. finally the reluctance of the
    regional administration to provide essential legislation for
    reorganising and restructuring library services is condemned as
    the root factor inhibiting network development.
