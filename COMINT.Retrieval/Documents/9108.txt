public library networking viewed from a state library
    agency. especially over the past 30 years, us state library
    agencies have played a major role in the planning and
    development of cooperative and networking activities among
    public libraries and between public libraries and other types
    of libraries. these activities have been carried out in a great
    variety of ways, with each state reacting to its own
    demographic, governmental, and library realities. the federal
    library services and construction act has been a major
    constructive force enabling state library agencies to be
    effective leaders in cooperative and networking activities.
    state library agencies and public libraries working together
    can continue to extend library services by taking leadership in
    networking activities.
