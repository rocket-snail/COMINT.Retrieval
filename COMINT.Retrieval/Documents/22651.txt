nature of discrete sources of cosmic radiation energy
    considerations of the colliding gas coronas n show that a
    considerable proportion of the kinetic energy of the colliding
    masses is transferred to a relatively small number of
    relativistic particles and hence into radiation the cut off
    frequency is estimated to be about assuming the particles to be
    electrons
