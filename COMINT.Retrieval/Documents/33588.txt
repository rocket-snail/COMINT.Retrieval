calculations of distortion and interference effects in
    transistor amplifier stages on the basis of the equivalent
    circuit diagram low frequency conditions and input signals up
    to maximum permissible amplitude are considered and the
    calculations are applied to two stage circuits the extension of
    the theory to high frequency conditions is indicated
