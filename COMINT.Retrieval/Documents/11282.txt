effect of an electric field on a continuously excited
    phosphor when an alternating electric field is applied to a zns
    cu phosphor excited to steady state luminescence a momentary
    increase of luminescence is observed with a subsequent drop and
    a slow change to a new steady state a periodic intensity ripple
    of double the field frequency e being superposed switching off
    the field generally results in a new momentary intensity with
    subsequent gradual return to the initial value these effects
    are explained on the basis of theory given by randall and
    wilkins of
