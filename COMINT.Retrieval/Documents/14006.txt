temperature dependence of ferromagnetic anisotropy in
    cubic crystals theories advanced by zener and by van vleck are
    reconciled they afford respectively low and high temperature
    approximations to the same physical picture namely an
    anisotropy decreasing with rising temperature due to
    statistical fluctuations from alignment of anisotropically
    coupled neighbour spins
