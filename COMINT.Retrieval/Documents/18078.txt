development of a high fidelity preamplifier for use in
    the recording of bioelectric potentials with intra cellular
    electrodes the cathode follower circuit conventionally used to
    minimize the time constant of the recording system is discussed
    and its shortcomings are analysed an improved circuit using
    positive feedback is described
