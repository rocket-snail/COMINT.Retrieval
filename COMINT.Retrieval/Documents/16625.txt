terminal properties of magnetic cores the terminal
    properties of the cores can be obtained from their dynamic step
    response it is shown that for thick mils or more thin mil and
    intermediate sized cores there is a unique relation between the
    flux in the core and the applied coulomb turns the analysis is
    verified by experiment
