some characteristics of solar corpuscular radiations
    which excite abnormal ionization in the polar upper atmosphere
    statistical data on the time delay from the occurrence of a
    major flare until the onset of polar absorption have been
    studied it is suggested that particles ejected from the sun may
    be trapped in a corpuscular cloud which may later intersect a
    magnetic line of force along which particles can travel to
    reach the earth
