step by step transition from wave optics to ray optics in
    inhomogeneous anisotropic absorbing media part solution of the
    equations for wave normal and refractive index by wbk
    approximation ray optical reflection and alternation the
    equations given in part of are solved the existence of
    particular points is established for which the transition canot
    be made
