interfacing the networks that keep libraries on-line.
    contribution to a special section on technology. utlas
    (university of toronto library automation systems) is an
    ancillary enterprise of the university with a completely
    separate budget and has been supplying computer services to
    canadian libraries since 1973. these services centred on
    catalogue support until recently, but there are new pilot
    projects on acquisitions, on-line circulation control, and
    on-line catalogue enquiries. utlas can also provide data to
    feed other computer systems. the ultimate goal is to offer
    libraries a complete service in direct competition with other
    systems vendors but with the advantage of its 10-million item
    data base. publishers are seen as a part of the eventual utlas
    network.
