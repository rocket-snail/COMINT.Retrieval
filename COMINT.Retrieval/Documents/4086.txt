the quality of automated systems and information
    analysis. a paper presented at a 1979 brazilian conference.
    while information control and document access techniques have
    benefited from the introduction of automated information
    retrieval systems and developments in information technology,
    it is on the quality of information input that the efficiency
    of automated systems depends. information processing should be
    integrated into the procedures for systems organisation and
    administration, and linked directly to information
    dissemination services. the chief factor governing quality of
    system input is information analysis, and in brazil this is
    almost totally neglected.
