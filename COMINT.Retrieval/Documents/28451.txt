the importance of libraries. paper presented by the papua
    new guinea minister for state on the occasion of the opening of
    the extension to adcol library, 15 oct 80. the primary function
    of the library is to provide information for and to educate its
    users-libraries are therefore sources of information and
    centres of learning and education, and the success or failure
    of a library to provide these services depends largely on the
    quality of the librarians who run it. libraries are essential
    services to national development.
