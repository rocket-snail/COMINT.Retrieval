udc and humanities and social sciences. the following
    papers were given in a udc conference in jyvaskyla in spring
    81: general overview of present udc; udc and automated
    information handling; chain indexing; cataloguing finnish
    literature; and centralised cataloguing. one of the major
    problems of udc is its slow machinery for revision. the
    structure of the scheme is well suited for automatic
    application. udc is used for the classification of legal
    deposit materials in finland. the present finnish edition of
    the scheme needs urgent revision, particularly in the
    humanities subjects.
