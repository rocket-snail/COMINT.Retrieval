maser amplifier characteristics for transmission and
    reflection cavities the noise temperature bandwidth and gain
    modulation for transmission and reflection type masers are
    compared the latter type is superior in most respects although
    the same noise temperature may be obtained with the
    transmission type with some sacrifice in bandwidth and gain
    modulation a figure of merit for both types is given
