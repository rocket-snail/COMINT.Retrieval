cathode coupled valves a graphical method is described
    for investigating cathode coupled amplifiers the method is
    demonstrated in relation to a circuit using a type twin triode
    and involves the construction of composite load lines on the
    anode characteristics an initial trial solution must be found
    to determine the voltage across tan ac cathode follower circuit
    of very high input impedance a push pull amplifier for the
    range is described each half of the input consists of a cathode
    follower with gain approximately unity with a constant current
    cathode load constituted by a further valve the effect of grid
    anode capacitance in the input valve is reduced by driving the
    anode by another cathode follower in series with it input
    capacitance is and input resistance up to circuit modifications
    to obtain zero or negative input capacitance are
    explained
