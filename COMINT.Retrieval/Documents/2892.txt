lessing's library post in wolfenbuttel. part i. gotthold
    ephraim lessing was librarian at the court of brunswick and
    luneberg in the 1770s. some of his most important writings were
    produced during this period but it should not be thought that
    the post was a sinecure held to enable him to write. there is
    proof in his own works that he took librarianship seriously.
    the opinions of various contemporary and modern writers on
    lessing's library work are analysed. many of his contemporaries
    thought him disorganised but his catalogue of new library
    stocks, amounting to about 100,000 volumes, remained unfinished
    because of staff shortages and ultimately because of his own
    death. some people regard him as the theoretical founder of
    modern lending libraries.
