electrostatic charges in plastics experimental evidence
    is presented that the static charge on plastics is a volume
    charge distribution rather than a surface distribution the
    charge contained in a plastic that has been in contact with
    metal is found to drain out of the plastic by a flow process
    which depends both upon the resistivity of the plastic and upon
    the possibility of neutralization of surface charges by
    opposite charges external to the plastic such as in air
