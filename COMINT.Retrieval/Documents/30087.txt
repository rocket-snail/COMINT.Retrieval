discussion and communication for staff in the hoogeveen
    public library. in 1971 a scheme of worker participation was
    introduced at hoogeveen public library in the netherlands.
    previously staff meetings were restricted to administrative
    staff only. under the new system weekly meetings were held at
    which the chief librarian and heads of the adult and children's
    departments were present. reports of these meetings were
    circulated to all heads of departments. in 1975 following the
    opening of a new central library the library service was
    reorganised into 8 departments and a new structure of staff
    meetings was introduced. in addition to the meetings attended
    by administrative staff and heads of departments, all staff of
    the internal services meet every 3 weeks, while staff of the
    external services meet each week. the purpose of these meetings
    is to improve staff motivation and thereby the quality of the
    library's services.
