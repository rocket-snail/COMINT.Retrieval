a critical commentary on leimkuhler's 'exact' formulation
    of the bradford law. argues that powerful operational research
    techniques operate only on a small fraction of the statistical
    information usually provided by the social sciences. uses the
    argument to illustrate leimkuhler's recent claim to have found
    an 'exact' fit to bradford's law. an elementary theorem of
    shannon information theory shows that his new function is
    applied to only 2.3% of the statistical information inherent in
    the bibliography he chooses and that bradford's original simple
    formulation not only fits this segment but also the whole
    bibliography more closely than the new formulation. as every
    statistical information loss can be measured, it can be shown
    that sophisticated mathematical techniques cannot compensate
    for the information they squander.
