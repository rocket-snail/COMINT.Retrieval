output coupling networks for use with logical circuits of
    the emitter current switching type zener diodes coupling
    networks required to transfer the collector voltage swing in
    emitter current switching circuits to earth level are
    considered the disadvantage of low coupling efficiency of
    passive output coupling networks is considered in comparison
    with the versatility which they give to standard logical
    elements
