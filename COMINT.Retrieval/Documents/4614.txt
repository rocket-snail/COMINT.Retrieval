field strength and temperature studies of electro
    luminescent powders in dielectric media measurements were made
    on electroluminescent cells using zns se cu phosphor dispersed
    in a thermo plastic matrix the intensity of luminescence
    depends critically on the field in the phosphor and hence on
    its dielectric constant but does not depend on the dielectric
    properties of the matrix except in so far as the latter
    provides a means of supporting a strong field in the phosphor
    little change of luminescent intensity was observed when the
    temperature was varied from to polystyrene being used as
    matrix
