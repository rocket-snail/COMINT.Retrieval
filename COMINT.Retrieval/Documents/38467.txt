the hollow cathode effect and the theory of glow
    discharges the electric field between two plane parallel
    cathodes was investigated by observing the deflection of an
    electron beam and simultaneously noting other discharge
    parameters results show that the field in the two cathode dark
    spaces falls linearly with distance from the cathode and thus
    the net space charge density is constant as in a conventional
    discharge the dark sace length was also determined the
    conclusions lead to a theory of glow discharges which takes
    account of the effect of ultraviolet quant from the glow on the
    photoelectric emission from the cathodes the discrepancy
    between earlier experimental results showing that ions of
    energy of the order of cathode fall of potential arrive at the
    cathode and classical calculations leading to low ion energies
    is resolved by allowing for small angle scattering and charge
    transfer
