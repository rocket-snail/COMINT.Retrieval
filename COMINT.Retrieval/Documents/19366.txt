conceptual information retrieval. if we want to build
    intelligent retrieval systems, we will have to give them the
    capabilities of understanding natural language, automatically
    organising and reorganising their memories, and using
    intelligent heuristics for searching their memories. these
    systems will have to analyse and understand both new text and
    natural language queries. in answering questions, they will
    have to direct memory search to reasonable places.
