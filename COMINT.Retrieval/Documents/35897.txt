class radio signals from venus at a wavelength of
    reception of radiation with a different waveform from that
    discussed previously is reported this radiation designated
    class is of a more sustained nature lasting for a second or
    longer and varying at an rate a record of a series of pulses
    observed on is shown the radiation appears to have a bandwidth
    of at least on studying tape recordings signals resembling
    echoes were oted these may be due to reflection from the
    moon
