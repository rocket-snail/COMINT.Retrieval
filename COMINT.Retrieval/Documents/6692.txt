what do students read in public libraries?. lecture given
    at the joint meeting of the study groups on university
    libraries and large municipal libraries in essen, june 81.
    university students turn 1st to the university library for the
    books they need but they also form a large reader group in the
    public library of a university town. recent surveys made in
    cologne and bochum reveal that the public library has a double
    function for students, covering both general and specialised
    literature demands. the students show great interest in social
    sciences and mathematics and their interest in science and
    technology equals that of the rest of the general public. they
    borrow less fiction than other readers, although they do
    usually demand works of high literary quality and they are
    attracted by branch library stocks as well as by those in
    central libraries.
