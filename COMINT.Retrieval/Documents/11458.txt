the a.d.a.c.e.s. experiment. an attempted evaluation. a
    progress report on a french project initiated in 1975 by the
    ministry of education under the direction of the association
    for the development of cultural activities in school
    establishments (a.d.a.c.e.s.). library and documentation
    centres were established in 6 elementary schools, and a number
    of studies carried out. this account is a synthesis of the last
    5 years' work, and covers (1) children's reading: what they
    read, sources of material, and borrowing from the centres; (2)
    how the centres function: formal and informal cultural
    activities, reader visits and use, the educational role of the
    librarian, and his relations with teachers and children; and
    (3) the influence of the centres on teaching practices:
    teachers' attitudes, and differences between schools in
    receptivity. reports of specific studies have appeared in a
    periodical devoted to the centres, details of which are given
    in a bibliography of some 40 items, which also includ es
    relevant articles from other french periodicals.
