    editors and referees in psychology. the views of psychology
    journal editors and editorial advisory board members were
    sought on the nature and functions of citation. information was
    gathered using an 18 item questionnaire. the feeling emerged
    that citation was a skill which authors acquired osmotically.
    considerable support was given to the idea that editors and
    referees could play a more positive role in establishing and
    encouraging consistency in authors' citation practices. where
    appropriate, replies have been interpreted in the light of
    prevailing theory. practical reasons for further research in
    this area are also considered.
