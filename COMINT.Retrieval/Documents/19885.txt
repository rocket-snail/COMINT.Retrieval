high sensitivity and accuracy pulse trigger circuit a
    pulse height discriminator is described which incorporates a
    highly stable differential negative resistance provided by a
    type multi electrode valve by virtue of current division
    between screen grid and anode this circuit is compared with
    that of kandiah in which the negative resistance is provided by
    a cathode coupled pair of valves the discriminator threshold
    can be set in the range with stability within
