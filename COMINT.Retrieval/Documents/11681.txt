the use of empirical standards in assessing public
    library effectiveness. reports research carried out in 1977-78
    in which multiple regression analysis was used to test the
    performance of (mainly) resource variables in explaining the
    level of circulation in public libraries in victoria,
    australia. concludes that' the levels of the variables explain
    very high proportions of the variance of library use;
    researchers are not yet justified in calling the observed
    relationships input-output functions; and, despite this, the
    strength of these relationships provides a powerful tool for
    comparing performances of libraries and for predicting future
    performance of a given library.
