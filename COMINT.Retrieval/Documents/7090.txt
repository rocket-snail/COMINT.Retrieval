reciprocity relations in active terminal elements it is
    shown by matrix analysis that under small signal conditions an
    active element such as a valve or transistor can be represented
    by an equivalent circuit comprising a triangle of resistances
    and a three terminal gyrator the active element is stable if
    one ad only one of the resitances is negative it is shown that
    the property of nonreciprocity is essential for an active three
    terminal element to be stable
