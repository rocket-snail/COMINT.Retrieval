zero-base budgeting for libraries' a second look.
    zero-base budgeting (zbb) was given considerable attention in
    the management literature during the latter 1970s. zbb offers
    many concepts and budgeting techniques that may prove
    especially useful to library administrators in the budget-tight
    1980s. includes a brief review of the key features of zbb as a
    budgeting/planning system, a discussion of the applications of
    zbb reported in the literature, and a summary of the special
    benefits and problems for libraries that use of concepts
    derived from zbb, if not zbb itself, might provide.
