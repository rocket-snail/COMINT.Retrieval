operating of the penning gauge experiments were made to
    check results reported by laffineur and pecker on the emission
    of hf waves from a gas discharge a receiver tunable over the
    band and fixed tuned receivers for and cm were used no
    radiation was detected on the last two wavelengths on the other
    wavelengths continuous spectra were observed with a fairly
    sharp peak at a frequency less than half the gyromagnetic
    frequency the effect of a component of electric field normal to
    the magnetic field is discussed
