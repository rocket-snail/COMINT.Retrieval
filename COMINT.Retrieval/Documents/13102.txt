further studies of spread f at brisbane vertical
    incidence ionograms and directional measurements on oblique
    incidence signals indicate that the spread f phenomenon is due
    to large ripples with a wavelength of twenty to over one
    hundred km seasonal and sunspot variations in the phenomenon
    are described model ionization distributions are constructed
    and ray paths drawn which may explain various types of spread f
    the amplitude of the ripples seems to increase with the height
    of the f layer
