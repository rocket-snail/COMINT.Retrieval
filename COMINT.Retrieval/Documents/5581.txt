on the line width in ferromagnetic resonance it is
    suggested that the line width is modified by a nonuniformity of
    the demagnetization field throughout the specimen it is shown
    that the broadening is greater for a disk magnetized normal to
    its plane than for one magnetized in its plane and also that
    the effect would be greater for ferrites than metals both
    results are in agreement with experiment
