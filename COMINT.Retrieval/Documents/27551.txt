censorship in colorado. since july 81, colorado has had 2
    censorship statutes. the 1st, senate bill 38, broadly
    establishes for the adult population what is obscene-what may
    be read, seen or heard. the 2nd, the result of house bill 1310,
    states that no material 'harmful to children' may be located
    where children might read, and thus effectively prohibits
    adults from the same material unless bookstores bar admittance
    to under-18s. despite the us constitution and bill of rights,
    guaranteeing freedom of expression, there seems to be an
    onslaught of people chipping away at this social foundation.
    questions the reasons why this should occur, and describes the
    booksellers' and librarians' roles in relation to the would-be
    censor.
