contact noise composition resistors is considered as
    consisting of a number of parallel circuits each containing an
    equal number of particles and the same number of contacts of
    equal resistance it is shown that the noise energys of such a
    homogeneous system is equal to that of a single contact and
    that for a given gradient of the applied direct voltage it is
    determined by the degree of dispersion and the specific
    resistance of the conductor material expressions are also
    derived for heterogeneous systems and imperfect contacts
