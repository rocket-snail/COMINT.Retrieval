    situation relating to libraries and the french speaking
    visually handicapped in canada and makes recommendations for
    improvement. statistics show the extent of visual handicap in
    quebec, the existing substitutes for conventional reading
    materials are briefly described, and services in the u.k. and
    u.s.a. are outlined as models. details are given of the
    specialised materials available in quebec from the canadian
    national institute for the blind; the nazareth and louis
    braille institute; and the quebec tape library for the blind.
    the reader services offered by these institutions are
    criticised as inadequate, and the results of a preliminary
    survey of 60 users conducted in march 81 are presented as
    evidence of the extent of readers' interests and their
    ignorance of the services available. proposes organisation of
    user training programmes, assesses the advantages and
    inconveniences of ordinary library services, and suggest
    improvements for public libraries in general.
