production of carbon in the upper atmosphere before
    decaying very fast neutrons originating from disintegrations by
    high energy cosmic ray particles may collide with nitrogen t
    atoms to produce and this neutron capture should result in
    carbon and boron atoms and traces of cyanogen gas being present
    in the upper atmosphere while by products of the mechanism may
    contribute significantly to the formation of the inner
    radiation belt
