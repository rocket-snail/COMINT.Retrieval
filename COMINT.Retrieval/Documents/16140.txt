a subject access project (sap)-a new test database for
    esa-quest. within the scope of the subject access project, a
    new version of on-line-catalogue for monographic publications
    has been developed. it is an effective aid for searches by
    subject as well as bibliographic data. the idea of sap is to
    produce subject descriptions of books taken from the books
    themselves and to make more use of the inherent attributes of a
    publication. to make possible a deeper analysis of the effects
    of sap-indexing technique the data base has been converted to
    esa-quest as a test file.
