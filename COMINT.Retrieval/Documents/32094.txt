toward library literacy. defines what is meant by
    'library literacy' and suggests that librarians should aim to
    educate users, and in particular student users, more broadly in
    the skills needed to make full use of a library, which can then
    be applied in different systems, rather than train them in
    depth in the use of specific works within their own
    library.
