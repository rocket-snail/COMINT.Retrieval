broadband transistor feedback amplifiers negative
    feedback amplifiers involving three cascaded common emitter
    junction transistor stage are discussed with large feedback
    stability conditions can be determined with sufficient accuracy
    by considering the forward and return paths of the feedback
    loop separately the maximum feedback possible without
    instability depends on the frequency characteristic of the
    transistor current gain this characteristic can be represented
    with adequate accuracy by a minimum phase approximation
    amplifiers with overall gain of and negative feedback of are
    described in which stability is secured by means of phase
    advancing networks in the return path
