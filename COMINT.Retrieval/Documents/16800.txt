new trigger circuits for use with cold cathode counting
    tubes a description is given of several trigger circuits
    devised for use particularly with dekatron tubes of bacon and
    pollard the circuits can be used in the construction of a
    scaling unit which can subtract as well as add the counting
    losses of such a unit when used on random pulses are
    considered
