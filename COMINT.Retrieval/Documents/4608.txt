self excitation with disk seal valves in a grounded grid
    circuit a circle diagram is derived for the internal capacitive
    coupling between anode and cathode in a grounded grid
    oscillator the phase of the transconductance and the input
    admittance resulting from the long transit times of electrons
    are taken into account calculations for several circuits with
    external feedback are made with th aid of the diagram
