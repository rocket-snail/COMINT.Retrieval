staff development and continuing education in the
    university library setting. the next decade will be crucial in
    determining the success of academic libraries in coping with
    future demands and constraints. one major element in this
    effort is developing and educating existing library staff.
    results of a survey carried out in 1979 to find out how
    university libraries responded to staff development, are
    compared to those of a 1976 survey. major subject areas covered
    in staff development in the 1970s as well as future topics are
    identified. staff development programmes in university
    libraries still need further growth in order to assist
    librarians in meeting the demands of the 1980s.
