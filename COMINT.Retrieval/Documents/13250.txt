potential distribution between two plane emitting
    electrodes equations are derived for two plane parallel
    electrodes made from different materials and kept at different
    temperatures numerical calculations are given for electrodes at
    the same temperature with an external potential difference
    between them all possible potential distributions are shown to
    be represented by a family of curves
