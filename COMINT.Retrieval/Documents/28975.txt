deadlock avoidance in store-and-forward networks.
    store-and-forward network deadlocks may be avoided by
    forwarding messages from buffer to buffer in accordance with a
    loop-free directed buffer graph which accommodates all the
    desired message routes. use of guaranteed paths in the buffer
    graph and optional path switching are described, along with
    message reclassification to free members of the common buffer
    pool. an efficient buffer-counting procedure in each node
    handles messages requiring several buffers, increases
    flexibility of buffer usage, minimises overheads during message
    reclassification or path switching, and simplifies jumping
    between normal low-overhead operation when deadlock is far and
    more careful operation when deadlock is near.
