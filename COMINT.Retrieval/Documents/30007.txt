libraries and the un's international year of the
    disabled. libraries have a special role in breaking down
    barriers which prevent handicapped readers gaining access to
    printed material. argues that most of the 50% in denmark who
    are not library users are more or less handicapped. some are
    handicapped from physical causes, and others are slow or new
    readers and dyslexics. describes the importance of reading in
    daily life and the reasons for lack of skill in reading.
    outlines rules for language and lay-out which make a book
    easier to read and the different types of book aimed at
    different groups ('ordinary' books, easy readers, magnaprint,
    braille, spoken books, book 0 tape). this kind of material is
    given too little priority by publishers and libraries. special
    care should be taken in design of libraries to make them
    accessible to the handicapped. the library must disseminate its
    services widely to the handicapped. during the international
    year it is important that libraries make a special effort and
    are represented on local organising committees.
