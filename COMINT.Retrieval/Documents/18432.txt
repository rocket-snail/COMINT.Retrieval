electrical breakdown at very low gas pressures a
    discussion in terms of atomic collision data of problems
    involved in the interpretation of an observed anomaly in the
    variation of breakdown strength with pressure and in the
    estimation of the pressure at which breakdown would occur if it
    were due solely to ionizing collisions in the body of the
    gas
