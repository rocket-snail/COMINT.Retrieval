theory of electrostatic fields in the ionosphere at
    equatorial latitudes an analysis is made of the elongated es
    fields required to provide the the e and f layer coupling in
    the dynamo theory for equatorial conditions the attenuation of
    the es field is found to be large implying very small coupling
    for fields with horizontal wavelengths of a few km most of this
    attenuation occurs at heights near the e region for an analysis
    in non equatorial regions see of october
