education for work in special libraries in new zealand.
    contribution to an issue on education for technological
    university library work. the basic needs for the education of
    special librarians in new zealand seem likely to be met by the
    new courses at the department of librarianship, victoria
    university of wellington, and the school of library studies,
    wellington teachers' college. there is an 18-week sandwich
    course at the college, leading to the n.z. library studies
    certificate, for untrained special library staff. the country's
    main lack would seem to be a properly organised and coordinated
    continuing education programme for all librarians.
