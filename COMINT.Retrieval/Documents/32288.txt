slit middle plate capacitors a contribution to the
    technique of calculation of potential fields a numerical
    calculation is made for a system coo parallel plates distant
    respectively cm z and cm on opposite sides of a third parallel
    plate with a slit cm wide the results are compared with
    electrolyte trough measurements
