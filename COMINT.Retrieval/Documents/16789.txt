instruction tapes for the hp2645a. the aims of the
    project team were to investigate the facilities of the hp2645a
    terminal, and to demonstrate its potential as a teaching tool,
    particularly in relation to the teaching of cataloguing. two
    trial tapes were produced to run on the terminal. one was a
    programmed text on chapter 21 of aacr2 (choice of main entry),
    and the other was an introduction to marc cataloguing. the
    report describes the tapes and the reactions to them of a group
    of librarianship students.
