the bibliographic situation and the national periodical
    catalogue, (part) 1' under the aegis of the library centre. in
    1954, a bibliographic joint committee was set up, whose task
    was to coordinate danish bibliographic publishing and initiate
    bibliographies where needed. it was to advise the library
    centre through participation in long term planning. in reality,
    control was left to the publishers and initiatives for new
    publications to individuals, international bodies and pressure
    groups. this situation is unlikely to change until the library
    commission's proposal for establishment of a national
    bibliographic council with responsibility for control of the
    national bibliography and state financing has been implemented.
    as long as the library centre has monopoly on production, it
    can dictate that libraries must pay high prices or else make do
    with fewer and inferior bibliographies. the librarians' union
    has therefore called for nationalisation of the national
    bibliography with free distribu tion to libraries.
