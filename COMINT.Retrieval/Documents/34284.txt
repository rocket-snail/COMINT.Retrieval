the start of a teacher training college library. from jan
    81 jonstrup teacher training college has had a professional
    library service in conjunction with lyngby public library. a
    librarian from the library has been stationed at, and paid by,
    the college since oct 80. a library committee of teaching
    staff, students and librarians was set up to analyse the
    college's needs as regards library services in general and a
    project due to start in 1981 in particular. it was agreed that
    a large centrally placed library was needed for staff and
    students, that lyngby library would make about 10% of annual
    accessions ready for lending, and that library staff would be
    available 4 hours daily. the present stock was to be examined
    for possible withdrawal or retention and registration. extra
    staff was secured for the organisation of the library and
    transfer of material from the special subject areas to the
    library.
