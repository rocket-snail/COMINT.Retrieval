the ala/acrl relationship. contribution to a special
    feature on the future of associations. discusses the
    relationship between the american library association and the
    association of college and reference libraries (later,
    association of college and research libraries). acrl came into
    existence as a response to the separate needs of academic
    librarians. the ala/acrl relationship has been rocky over the
    years-some see it as an equal partnership, others as a
    parent/adolescent child relationship. a 1981 summit meeting in
    chicago suggested several fundamental changes in the ala at the
    highest level. these suggestions are investigated in some
    detail.
