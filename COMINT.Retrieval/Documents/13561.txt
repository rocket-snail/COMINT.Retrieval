artificial increase of electrical breakdown strength of

    of and are reported under these conditions the superposition of
    a moderate direct voltage on the alternating voltage can
    increase the uhf breakdown stress quite considerably typical
    results obtained with direct voltages up to are shown
    graphically the effect is large enough to find practical
    application as an inhibitor of breakdown in electronic
    equipment for operation at high altitudes
