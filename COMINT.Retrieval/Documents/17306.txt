library-use instructions' assessment of the long term
    effects. the recognition by librarians of the growing
    importance of evaluating library-use instruction is steadily
    increasing, as evidenced by reports in the literature. however,
    much work has yet to be done which uses sophisticated
    evaluation techniques. reports the follow-up of an earlier
    study by examining the long-term retention of library-use
    skills. through use of pretesting and posttesting, control and
    experimental groups, aggregate and individual comparisons,
    multiple regression, and other techniques, concludes that
    long-term possession of library-use skills is more highly
    related to library-use instruction than to either inherent
    intellectual ability or academic diligence. in addition,
    discusses the appropriateness of quantitative and qualitative
    methods of evaluation and caution against taking for granted
    the effective use of evaluation.
