management-by-objectives applied in a south african
    industrial library. management-by-objectives is suggested as a
    means to justify the existence of an industrial library and
    information service. the prerequisites are that the industrial
    librarian must grasp the special circumstances under which a
    service function operates in industry as well as the attitudes
    towards these functions. he must also acquaint himself with the
    objectives of the organisation he serves and arrange his
    services to make a definable contribution towards the
    achievement of these organisational objectives. the objectives
    of the different departments must be used as premises for
    determining where the library and information function should
    operate and how its services should be presented. the
    information service (which consists of 3 sections, a library,
    translation bureau and information dissemination) of the south
    african iron and steel industrial corporation (iscor) is used
    as a working example. the use of mbo by isc or is briefly
    discussed and the objectives of iscor and its general manager
    are mentioned. from these objectives areas of responsibility
    are derived and identified in the form of the different iscor
    departments.
