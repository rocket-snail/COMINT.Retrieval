static dynamic design of flip flop circuits discussion of
    the design of flip flop circuits for operation from a
    relatively low supply voltage a desirable feature for computer
    elements the circuit adopted uses negative pulse triggering and
    a diode input circuit the minimum trigger voltage being
    adjustable by means of two variable resistors stability is
    determined by use of rouths criteria general directions for the
    design of flip flop circuits for low voltage operation are
    summarized
