information services in industrial research institutes.
    summary of a 1977 brazilian thesis in information science.
    presents a model for information centres in research
    institutes, to identify potential clients and promote the
    services of the parent organisation. 8 common types of
    information services are defined, and 14 different kinds of
    research institutes relevant to this model listed. the proposed
    model demonstrates how to establish the characteristics of both
    internal and external users; the nature of the information
    needs of researchers, technicians, and marketers; and the
    information services to be offered, with particular reference
    to abstracting and question and answer services. by effecting
    continuous interaction between the institute and its clients
    such information services allow identification of the nature of
    potential demands for information, technical services, and
    research.
