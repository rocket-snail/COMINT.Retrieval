if only they had a telephone...' rgues that much
    reference work is based on inadequate and outdated reference
    material leading to wrong answers to queries. for this reason a
    project aimed at building up a regional information centre at
    the regional library in kalmar was initiated. the aim was to
    achieve a well selected reference stock in all libraries
    according to size and need, effective use of these aids and of
    the regional library's reference section. a precondition of
    this is a well functioning telephone service. in order to
    coordinate and improve information supply to the individual,
    plans should be made for information activity within a
    municipality and region which include training of reference
    librarians, and the library should be more widely advertised as
    a source of information.
