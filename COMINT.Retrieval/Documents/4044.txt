on the nonoptical theory of focusing in rotating magnetic
    fields the difficulties arising in the application of optical
    methods to electron optics are pointed out the general theory
    of t e focusing action of static magnetic fields developed by
    grinberg which is based on nonoptical methods is applied to the
    case of paraxial electron beams in rotating magnetic
    fields
