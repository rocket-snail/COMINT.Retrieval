a formal treatment of document information systems. deals
    with a mathematical formulation of document information
    systems. the model of document information systems is given as
    an interpretation of a formal language. in the formal language,
    a concept of the labelled terms is introduced as the most basic
    concept, from a viewpoint of hierarchical semantic structure
    analysis of documents. the labels are intended to denote the
    context information, called the information functions in this
    paper, in the text of documents.
