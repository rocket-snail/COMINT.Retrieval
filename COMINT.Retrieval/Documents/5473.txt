conductivity of the ionosphere the investigations of
    various workers relative to balfour stewarts dynamo theory of
    geomagnetic diurnal variations are reviewed and the fundamental
    principles involved in the production of electric currents in
    the ionosphere by tidal winds are reexamined three
    conductivities two of which are related to the hall effect
    appear to be involved one of these has two relatively small
    maxima at km height due mainly to ions and due to electrons the
    second has a broad maximum at thus including all the e region
    ionization and the third has a very pronounced sharp maximum at
    km discussion shows that the effective conductivity of the
    ionosphere over most of the earth is some twelve times greater
    than that deduced when the hall current is ignored and near the
    magnetic equator the conductivity is increased further by a
    factor of equations developed appear to account quantitatively
    for the high conductivity required by the dynamo theory and
    also for the increased conductivity near the magnetic equator
    near the equator the current system should be in a relatively
    thin layer centred at about km height evidence of the existence
    of a current sheet between the and levels has recently been
    obtained by singer et al in rocket experiments
