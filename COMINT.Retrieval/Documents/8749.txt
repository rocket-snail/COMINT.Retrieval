complex conductivity of some plasmas and semiconductors
    the complex conductivities of plasmas and semiconductors have
    been calculated for several cases where the collision frequency
    can be expressed as a power function of the energy from the
    result some characteristic parameters of the plasma originally
    investigated by spitzer are estimated the problem of
    determining the relaxation from a non symmetrical dispersion is
    discussed
