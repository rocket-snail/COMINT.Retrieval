the use of automated data processing in libraries' ideas
    for a new viewpoint. although librarians formerly adopted a
    defensive attitude when introducing automated data processing,
    its use resulted in ergonomic improvements and more interesting
    work for some staff. the use of automated data processing can,
    however, cause stress and monotony, the control of work and
    human potential by machines, increased isolation of
    individuals, the downgrading of some library posts and the loss
    of a friendly atmosphere for readers. if the human touch is to
    be retained in libraries, new standards are required. good
    communication must be developed between staff members and
    between staff and readers. staff work must be reorganised and
    the tendency to gigantism in the use of automation
    avoided.
