essen workshop 1981' training readers in the use of
    audio-visual media, 1-3 april 1981. lectures were given on
    training readers in the use of audio-visual material at home
    and abroad. forms of training can be very varied; the choice of
    media used depends on the reader's previous knowledge and
    experience and on economic and institutional conditions. at the
    chalmers university of technology, goteborg, the library
    provides a basic introduction for 1st time users, a 14 hour
    course on library search techniques and an advanced course on
    information retrieval. the emphasis should be on 'learning by
    doing'. the collection and information centre for audio-visual
    media planned by the british library was described and a
    discussion was held on the merits and demerits of different
    media. more cooperation is required between media producers and
    librarians.
