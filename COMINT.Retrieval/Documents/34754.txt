semantic limitation in freetext retrieval based on
    morphological segmentation. the basic problem in freetext
    retrieval is that the retrieval language is not properly
    adapted to that of the author. morphological segmentation,
    where words with the same root are grouped together in the
    inverted file, is a good eliminator of noise and information
    loss, providing high recall but low precision. precision can be
    increased through the process described, whereby semantic
    information from the morphological periphery of the roots can
    be obtained, which can be very relevant in information
    retrieval. the process involves relationships through
    derivative suffixes, prefixes and composite terms, plus the use
    of link operators; various formulation possibilities are
    illustrated. automatic inclusion of autonomous word structures
    is allowed.
