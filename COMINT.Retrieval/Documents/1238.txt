predictions of cosmic ray storms from geomagnetic data
    the need for simultaneous high altitude soundings and ground
    observations during cosmic ray storms is established the times
    of the sudden commencement of a geomagnetic storm and the
    forbush decrease of cosmic ray intensity show insufficient
    correlation for accurate predictions to be made
