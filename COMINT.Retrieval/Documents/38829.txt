theory of hall effect in ferromagnetics assuming phonon
    interaction the hall voltage is given by the equation where are
    constants are the resistances of the specimen at absolute zero
    and at temperature respectively is the intensity of
    magnetization at saturation and is the current density
    comparison with experimental results obtained from measurements
    on a bar shaped specimen shows close agreement
