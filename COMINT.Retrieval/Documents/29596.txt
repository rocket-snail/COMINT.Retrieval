quenching of afterglow in gaseous discharge plasmas by
    low power microwaves continuation of work noted in of september
    results are reported for neon of the effect on the plasma decay
    of applying microwave pulses at various time intervals after
    the production of the plasma the state of decay was determined
    by observing the afterglow by means of photocells and
    displaying the amplified photocurrent on an oscilloscope
    decrease of light intensity observed during the application of
    the pulse is most probably due to reduction of the
    recombination rate differences in the traces observed at
    pressures of mm hg and mm hg are discussed the effect may be
    useful for detecting the energy
