the transient response of transistor switching circuits
    transient response of the point contact transistor in a
    grounded base circuit is considered using a linearized
    equivalent circuit the required trigger voltages for both
    directions of switching are found experimentally to be greater
    than suggested y the static characteristic and to depend on
    trigger pulse width to a different extent for the two
    directions to fit these findings it is assumed that cut off
    frequency is high when the transistor is switched off and low
    when it is switched on the one shot multivibrator is discussed
    in the light of these assumptions
