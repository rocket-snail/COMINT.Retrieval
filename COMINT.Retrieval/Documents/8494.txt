trends of development in the field of electrical
    component for telecommunication component design is considered
    from the point of view of the physics and chemistry involved in
    meeting the requirements of operation over a particular
    frequency band operation under conditions of prescribed current
    waveform and intensity operation under peak loads operation at
    low loss operation under given ambient conditions operation
    under restrictions of tolerance stability and durability
