theory of ionized media with distant boundaries
    continuation of work noted in of the theory is developed for a
    configuration in which the electrodes are relatively close
    while the boundaries are relatively distant experimental
    results confirm the theory the solution of the differential
    equations involved and summarized theory of the potential
    distribution in the mercury vapour rectifier arc are given in
    appendices
