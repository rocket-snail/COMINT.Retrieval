the calculation of energy flow using the laplace
    transformation laplace perseval integral is applied to
    determine energy flow directly from the laplace transforms of
    the applied force and the resultant response the method is
    applicable to both transient and steady states and leads
    directly to the most simple form of solution the method is most
    advantageous when the applied force possesses several
    discontinuities as an example the classical problem of eddy
    current losses in linear sheet conductors is solved in general
    for arbitrary excitations
