    collection building in the eighteenth century. the
    correspondence of abbe jean paul bignon, master of the king's
    library in paris, and sir hans sloane, a distinguished
    physician and founder of the british museum, typifies the
    informal network for the exchange of scholarly information and
    new publications that provided unifying links of knowledge in
    18th century anglo-french intellectual life. these men
    regularly procured the latest scholarly books and periodicals
    published in their respective countries and transmitted them
    through diplomatic channels or by travellers and
    merchants.
