the noise temperature of cascade connected amplifiers a
    formula is derived for the noise temperature of a cascade
    connected amplifier with negative conductances as active
    elements this permits a simple graphical representation of
    noise characteristics examples are given of parametric
    amplifier stages and the influence of isolators and circulators
    on noise temperature and bandwidth is discussed
