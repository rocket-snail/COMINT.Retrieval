    department coordinates orders received from the central and
    subject libraries and controls all pre-accession work, finance

    proves successful. the central acquisitions department finds
    information on domestic and foreign literature and sends this
    to the subject librarians. literature selection is made jointly
    by the subject librarians and the faculties. the subject
    librarian traces missing bibliographic details for the
    acquisitions department. german language material is bought
    from local book-sellers, foreign material from a variety of
    sources; gifts, exchanges and deposit copies also provide
