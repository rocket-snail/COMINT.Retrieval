on the production of glow discharges in the ionosphere by
    winds a source of excitation of the airglow and aurora may be
    found in the potential difference generated by zonal
    ionospheric winds cutting the earths magnetic field a return
    path of current flow or glow discharge in the higher ionosphere
    appears plausible
