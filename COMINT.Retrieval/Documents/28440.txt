research into the reading habits of soviet young people
    in the 1920s. with the recognition today of the supreme
    importance of work with children, new attention is being paid
    to the early attempts to study the reading behaviour of young
    people in the 1920s. both lenin and krupskaya stressed the need
    for soviet librarians to get to know the needs and the
    backgrounds of the people they were trying to serve, but early
    published research into young people's reading tended to be
    more enthusiastic than accurate. in later work the methodology
    improved and the basis was laid down for much of today's
    research.
