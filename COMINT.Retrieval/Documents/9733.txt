derivation of the boltzmann transport equation for
    inelastic collisions a quantum mechanical treatment similar to
    that developed by kohn and luttinger for elastic collisions of
    for fermi dirac particles the scattering in the collision terof
    the transport equation is restricted to unoccupied states
