indexing with nominal phrases. indexing with nominal
    phrases is a strict continuation of the development from
    coordinate to syntactic indexing. nominal phrases are user
    oriented and especially suitable for complex terms. a nominal
    phrase consists of a nucleus with a left-hand and/or right-hand
    attribute. attribute and nucleus can occur several times at the
    same hierarchic level. the use of nominal phrase indexing is
    illustrated with descriptions of 3 manual indexing
    systems-titus, casin and gerdok-and 1 automatic system-detect.
    in automatic indexing with nominal phrases a complete syntactic
    analysis is unnecessary; even systems with partial parsing
    routines produce acceptable results. the problem of retrieval
    with nominal phrases is still unsolved.
