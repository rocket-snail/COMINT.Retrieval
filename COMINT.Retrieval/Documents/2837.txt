some boundary value problems involving plasma media a
    plasma consisting of a neu ral mixture of electrons ions and
    molecules in the presence of a constant magnetic field
    possesses a dielectric constant which is in the form of a
    tensor exact solutions of boundary value problems involving
    such media are obtained for two dimensional configurations
    explicit results are given for the reflection coefficients of
    stratified plasma in planar and cylindrical geometry
