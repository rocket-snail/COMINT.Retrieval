just like home and cheaper than the cafe. report on karup
    library, with an interview with the librarian, birte ellermann.
    the library is housed in a converted railway station. the lack
    of space and the retention of the old inner walls contribute to
    the intimate and friendly atmosphere. 75% of the population use
    it, compared to 30% before conversion. the young people's room
    on the 1st floor is a popular meeting place for the 13-16 year
    olds. b. ellermann, then librarian at the nearby karup airforce
    base, was asked to draw up a plan for the library structure in
    the area. her decentralised plan of 3 independent libraries
    gave her a danish library association prize. local craftsmen
    have executed her own interior design. exhibitions are made
    locally, and books are received from a local bookseller and
    made ready in the library so that they reach the shelves while
    still topical.
