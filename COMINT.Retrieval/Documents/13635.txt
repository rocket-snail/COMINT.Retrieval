information flow between primary journals and secondary
    services in the biological field, parts i and ii. an
    international study was initiated by the european association
    of editors of biological periodicals (else) to develop standard
    guidelines for abstracts of different types of biological
    paper, in order to improve the quality of abstracts in primary
    journals and facilitate their use by secondary services. as a
    preliminary step, a qualitative evaluation of bibliographic
    data and abstract presentation and content was carried out on a
    representative sample of 240 journals. data are presented on
    the country and language of publication; authors' addresses;
    bibliographic annotations; categories and types of papers;
    inclusion of keywords; use of sub-headings; position of
    abstracts; quality of abstracts; length of papers and
    abstracts; provision and quality of translated abstracts. in
    addition, a survey was made of the instructions to authors
    issued by the 240 journal editors, with particular reference to
    instructions on writing abstracts.
