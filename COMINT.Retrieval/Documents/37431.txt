physics of thin metal and semiconductor films a survey of
    work on formation structure and electrical properties of thin
    metal and semiconductor films surface states and their effect
    on the properties of semiconductor films theoretical work on
    thin metal films the present position is briefly but critically
    discussed and in particular the points of agreement and
    disagreement between experimental results and theory are
    noted
