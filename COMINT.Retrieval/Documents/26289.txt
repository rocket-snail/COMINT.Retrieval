the application of statistical methods to servo
    mechanisms the optimum transfer function for the desired
    response to a stationary random input signal containing noise
    may be determined by the wiener lee method in general when
    applied to servo mechanisms design the output will not
    necessarily have zero steady state error in order to overcome
    this disadvantage constraints may be applied in the wiener hopf
    equation such that any of the error coefficients of the
    servomechanism are zero and at the same time the output is
    optimized it is also possible to include prediction
    differentiation or integration of the input function as
    desirable outputs
