british education index' 1the user's problems subject
    search was made in 2british education index 1(january-june
    1981) for information on the following topics. education
    systems of eastern europe, the teaching of children from ethnic
    minorities, the education of mature students, and remedial
    education. in each case very little material was traceable by
    looking under the more obvious headings and it was impossible
    to decide when the search was complete. only a cover-to-cover
    reading of bei could retrieve all the relevant articles with
    any degree of certainty. although much material was in bei, the
    use of precis constituted a barrier in every case and made
    retrieval difficult.
