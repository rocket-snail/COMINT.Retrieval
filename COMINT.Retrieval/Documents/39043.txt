an optical method for determining the complex dielectric
    constant and the magnetic permeability a method applicable in
    the cm and mm wave ranges is described which depends on
    determination of the normal incidence reflection and
    transmission factors of a plane parallel plate the calculation
    is based on the general matrix equations of the field as
    derived from maxwells equations
