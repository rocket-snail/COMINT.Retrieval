synthesis of a dynamically variable electronic filter the
    principles of network synthesis are applied to the design of a
    variable bandwidth filter with an upper cut off frequency which
    can be varied dynamically over the frequency range kcs the
    bandwidth variation is automatically controlled by voltages
    applied to the control grids of pentodes slight changes
    occurring in selectivity and midband gain
