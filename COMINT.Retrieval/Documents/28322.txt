exact amplitude frequency characteristics of ladder
    networks a basic theory of the low pass ladder networks is
    developed on similar lines to dishals treatment of the theory
    can be applied by well known analogies to the derived band pass
    high pass and band stop filters two types of desired frequency
    response curves are considered the butterworth and tchebycheff
    types general solutions are obtained for both the results are
    applied to many practical problems including the use of
    networks for coupling a valve to a resistive load or to another
    valve power bandwidth and gain bandwidth curves being
    determined for particular cases impedance matching between a
    generator and its load is also considered and matching networks
    are designed examples are also given of the design of low pass
    and band pass filters with either the butterworth or the
    tchebycheff type of response many useful design curves being
    given
