asymmetry in conductivity of some selenides the
    experimentally determined current voltage characteristics of a
    cuse me rectifier are discussed the ratio of reverse to forward
    current varies between and the power handling capacity is and
    the blocking layer is stable even at the principal
    disadvantages of this rectifier are the large hysteresis effect
    and the de forming after prolonged storage other selenides and
    selenide metal combinations are briefly noted
