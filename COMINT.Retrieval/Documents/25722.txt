on the stability of random systems and the stabilization
    of deterministic systems with random noise a general theory of
    mean square stability of random linear systems in which
    parameters may vary as white noise processes is developed and
    applied to a rlc circuit the possibility of stabilizing
    unstable deterministic systems by means of random noise is
    predicted
