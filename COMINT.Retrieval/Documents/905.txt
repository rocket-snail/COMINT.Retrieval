matrix analysis of multiterminal transducers the
    multiterminal transducer is defined as a network with a set of
    n input terminals and a set of n output terminals it can be
    represented by its impedance admittance or transfer matrix
    special properties of networks exhibiting symmetry and or
    reciprocity are discussed the representation is classed as
    definite or indefinite according as the voltage reference
    terminals are or are not specified simple networks can be
    analysed by inspection more complicated networks may be treated
    as cascades of simple ones the method is illustrated by
    deriving the transfer matrices of some simple networks
    including a distributed amplifier section
