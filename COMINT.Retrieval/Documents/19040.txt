responsibility, development and community. a talk given
    at a course on leadership-public libraries at the local
    authorities' high school, nov 81. discusses politicians'
    expectations of the library and its staff. cooperation between
    local politicians and librarians is often hampered by the
    librarians' preference for centrally imposed norms instead of
    adaptation to local needs. but imposition of obligations takes
    away spontaneity. objects to self-appointed moralists guiding
    the people's cultural needs in a certain ideological direction.
    comprehensiveness, one of the library objectives, cannot be on
    the basis of a particular book, which must necessarily present
    a particular viewpoint, but must be an overall guideline. the
    library law, like modern education and social laws, should
    specify an obligation to development planning in the individual
    authority, not lay down external structural norms without
    regard to local conditions. the leading librarian and the
    leading head teacher must have equal say on the cultural
    committee to secure libraries' independence from an
    administrative leader from the education service. libraries
    must nourish the qualified doubt and supply the means for
    constructive criticism of expert knowledge necessary in the
    democratic decision making process. libraries and local
    politicians must cooperate in keeping art and culture
    independent of political and commercial influence.
