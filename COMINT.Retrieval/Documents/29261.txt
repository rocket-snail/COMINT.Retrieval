an analysis of parametric amplification in periodically
    loaded transmission lines the propagating structure is
    considered as a lossless transmission line periodically loaded
    with nonlinear capacitance in the form of back biased
    semiconductor diodes information is given about the relation of
    diode parameters spacing and circuit parameters to the gain and
    bandwidth of the structure
