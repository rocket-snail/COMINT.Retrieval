computer generation of gamma random variables a new
    method for generating random variables from the gamma
    distribution with nonintegral shape parameter a is proposed.
    this method is similar to two other methods recently given by
    wallace and fishman. it is compared with fishman's and ahrens
    and dieter's methods. the core storage requirements and
    programming effort for this method are similar to those of
    fishman's method. the proposed method is the same as fishman's
    method for 1 < a < 2 and is faster than fishman's method
    for 3 < a < 19. also, the proposed method is much simpler
    than ahrens and dieter's method and is faster for a < 8.
