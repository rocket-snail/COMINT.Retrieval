a new method for generating relaxation oscillations with
    a gas filled triode large amplitude relaxation oscillations can
    be generated by applying a small hf voltage to the grid of a
    gas filled triode in which the grid is connected to the cathode
    via a high resistance the waveform of the relaxation
    oscillation depends on the parameters of the circuit in
    parallel with the anode to cathode path and on the excitation
    frequency and the frequency of the relaxation oscillation can
    be varied over a wide range
