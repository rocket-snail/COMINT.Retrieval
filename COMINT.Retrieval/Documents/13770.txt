iranian library of medicine local computer network. in
    order to improve the status of biomedical communications in
    iran, the iranian library of medicine (ilm) embarked on a long
    term plan which also included computerisation of certain
    functions of the library. implementation of this plan started
    by establishing an access node to the national library of
    medicine's (nlm) medline data base, and was followed by the
    setting up of a computer-communications network to provide
    local services, to allow several organisations to have
    simultaneous access to the nlm's data bases, and to cater for
    accessing other data bases available through us-based
    international computer networks. this paper considers the
    circumstances governing the design of the network, reports the
    progress so far achieved in the implementation of the plan, and
    describes major difficulties encountered. the resulting
    increase in the use of the services provided is also noted by
    presenting general statistics of medline use in the regi
    on.
