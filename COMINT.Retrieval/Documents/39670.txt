stable high speed digital to analogue conversion for
    storage tube deflection discussion of the design of access
    circuitry for a barrier grid tube temporary storage system
    which converts a bit binary address into the analogue voltage
    necessary to deflect the electron beam to a specific storage
    area defined by the address a special feedback circuit and
    raster reference tube control the size and centring of the
    array of storage s study of the impedance of capacitors as a
    function of frequency strip stacked and disk type capacitors
    have been studied the natural resonant frequency is almost
    entirely dependent on the capacitance value and the
    connections
