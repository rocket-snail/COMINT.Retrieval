solar proton stream forms with a laboratory model a
    stormertron tube is described for simulating the streams of
    charged particles in the earthsdipole magnetic field
    photographs of stream forms and contacts are presented the same
    techniques can be used to study stream forms in other
    complicated magnetic fields
