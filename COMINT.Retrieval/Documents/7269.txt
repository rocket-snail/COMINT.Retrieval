methodological centres and the control they exercise over
    public libraries. the ministry of culture of the slovak
    socialist republic has assigned to methodological centres the
    task of participating in the management of public libraries in
    all its aspects. this is done by inspection, advice and finally
    suggestion of solutions to the library's management personnel.
    the scope of their authority is, however, not quite clear.
    delegation of greater independence of decision to
    methodological workers is desirable. solutions suggested for
    methodological approach to district and similar libraries are
    expressed by means of flow-charts.
