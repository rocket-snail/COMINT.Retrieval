differential amplifiers with asymmetrical output the
    basic circuit discussed comprises a pair of similar triodes
    with equal resistances in anode and cathode leads when equal
    phase voltages are applied to the two grids voltages in phase
    opposition are produced at the cathode of one valve and the
    anode of the other the output is taken from the mid point of
    the circuit connecting these two points theory of operation is
    presented and two experimental models are described
