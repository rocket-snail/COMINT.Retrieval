power rectifiers and transistors power rectifiers with
    rectification ratios as high as can be made by fusing donor and
    acceptor contacts to the opposite faces of a ge wafer analysis
    of the characteristics of such rectifiers gives results in good
    agreement with experimental values the properties of
    transistors prepared in a similar manner and capable of outputs
    as high as are described at present the operation of these
    power units is limited to about by transit time effects
