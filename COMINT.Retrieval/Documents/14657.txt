depository libraries as means of making library services
    more effective. the various systems of depository libraries in
    the ussr, hungary and east germany are briefly outlined. in
    czechoslovakia the federal government declaration no. 237 from
    1977 and the slovak government declaration no. 417 from the
    same year are concerned with the building of depository
    libraries. the national coordination centre worked out in 1979
    a proposal for the central depository library in bratislava. it
    is envisaged that the library will be built in zabi majer near
    raca, close to bratislava city. the actual building is expected
    to be ready by 1987; up to this time the central depository
    library will function in temporary premises.
