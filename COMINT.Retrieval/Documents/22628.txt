sampling in archives' an essay illustrating the value of
    mathematically based sampling and the usage of techniques other
    than simple random sampling within archives; or, coping with
    10,000 feet of invoices before retirement. discusses what
    sampling is, refuting the claim that archival sampling and
    mathematical sampling are distinct and separate methods;
    addresses the problem of implementation, in particular to
    suggest an alternate technqiue to simple random sampling; and
    demonstrates the legitimacy of sampling by reporting the
    results of it carried out on a typical archival record group,
    of known values.
