radiation by charged particles passing through an
    electron plasma in an external magnetic field coupling between
    the longitudinal plasma wave and the transverse em wave
    modifies the nature of the radiation at particle velocities
    greater than that required for the excitation of plasma waves a
    non cherenkov type of radiation will occur
