correlation energy of an electron gas at high density
    plasma oscillations an analysis of the contribution made by
    zero point oscillations to the correlation energy of an
    electron gas at high density this contribution is expressed in
    terms of that from the scattering states by using the analytic
    properties of the scattering amplitudes the results are
    compared with those of bohm pines of
