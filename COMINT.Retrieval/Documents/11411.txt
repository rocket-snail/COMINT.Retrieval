design data for band pass ladder filters employing
    ceramic resonators graphical and tabulated design data based on
    image parameter theory are given for filter comprising
    piezoelectric disks resonating in a radial mode with or without
    capacitors the ranges of centre frequency bandwidth and image
    impd impedance achievable are discussed
