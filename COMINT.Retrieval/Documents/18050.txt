a relevant library service. libraries collect, store and
    disseminate relevant knowledge and information to national
    populations. the term 'relevant information' is discussed in
    relation to the kenyan population. approximately 95% of the
    kenyan population is made up of workers and peasants and a
    relevant library service should be aware of the problems that
    these people have to face. the content of the information
    communicated, the way in which it is communicated and the
    language in which it is communicated are important aspects
    which need to be considered by the library service if it is to
    supply information to those people who need it most. the
    people's republic of china is cited as a country where some
    success has been made in overcoming these problems. much
    valuable information has accumulated over the years among the
    population and could be usefully applied if it was successfully
    provided to those who need it.
