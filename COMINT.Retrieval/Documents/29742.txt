distributed amplifiers some new methods for controlling
    gain frequency and transient responses of amplifiers having
    moderate bandwidths distributed amplifiers of moderate
    bandwidths for steady state applications may be constructed for
    almost constant gain up to or of cut off by methods including
    the insertion of extra sections into the use of networks whose
    image impedance at a shunt capacitance point falls to zero at
    the cut off frequency for waveform amplification the use of m
    derived low pass networks with added resistance elements is
    suggested the image delay is then almost constant over of the
    non dissipative pass band ad the image attentuation varies in
    approximately gaussian fashion with frequency over most of the
    pass band in this second case the maximum useful number of
    valves per stage is five
