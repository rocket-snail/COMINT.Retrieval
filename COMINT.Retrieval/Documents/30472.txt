freeze-drying-a method to salvage soaked books. 134
    valuable old books were damaged by water from the hoses of the
    fire brigade when a building used as storage for the
    erzbischofliche diozesan- und dombibliothek at cologne caught
    fire. after freezing the books at -18 c in a cold-storage house
    they were dried in a rented freeze-drying chamber some months
    later. the books were restored without any damage, other than
    to the covers which lost form and had to be rebound.
