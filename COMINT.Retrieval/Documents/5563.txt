rudolph focke and the theory of the classified catalog.
    between 1900 and 1905, rudolph focke published a series of
    papers on classification theory and a draft of code for the
    construction of classified catalogues. his work was the direct
    result of the reform of librarianship during the last decades
    of the 19th century. the large number of classification systems
    used by german university and research libraries was seen as an
    obstacle to the development of national systems of
    bibliographic control and access. the hope of standardisation
    came to nothing; focke's code may even have had the opposite
    effect of perpetuating local systems well into the 20th
    century. his work was introduced to librarians in the usa at a
    time when subject cataloguing and classification were in
    transition. his code is consistent with the general principles
    underlying the library of congress classification, which may
    have been more influenced by 19th century german classification
    than has hertofore been recognised. re port not available from
