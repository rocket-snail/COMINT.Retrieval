rationalisation and modellification' two complementary
    implications of information technologies. debates on the
    effects of information technologies are usually limited to 3
    subjects' computers, privacy, and job-killing. the reality is
    far more complex. numerous information technologies have come
    into existence and tend to combine or merge with each other,
    causing 3 classes of social effects' rationalisation of the
    labour process(es) involved; modellification
    (planning/regulating/controlling) of the
    persons/things/procedures modelled by data and software; and
    social, political, and economic aims superseding the
    information system's original purpose. shows in theory how this
    can be explained and generalised to all information
    technologies and discusses in practical terms how to avoid
    negative and promote positive consequences.
