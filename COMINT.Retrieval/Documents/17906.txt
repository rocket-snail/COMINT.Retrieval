a hyperbolic detector the detector considered comprises a
    double triode the grids of which are in parallel the anodes in
    push pull and the cathodes biased separately the detection
    characteristic will be hyperbolic if a rectangular or
    trapezoidal characteristic is obtained on plotting the
    difference between the anode currents against the grid voltage
    the effect of varying the modulation voltage is
    considered
