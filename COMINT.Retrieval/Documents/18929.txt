a study of two mc s ionospheric absorption measurements
    at high latitudes from a study of the data of five stations in
    canada during the i g y it is found that a the winter anomaly
    of noon absorption occurs at churchill but is absent at
    resolute bay b the effect of solar zenith angle as illustrated
    at the diurnal variation of absorption decreases with
    increasing latitude c midnight absorption is a maximum in the
    auroral zone but is also high over the polar cap
