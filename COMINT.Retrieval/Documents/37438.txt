an attempt to detect linearly polarized radio emission
    from the galaxy a paraboloidal reflector was used at a
    frequency of with receiver bandwidth of plots of position angle
    of the plane of polarization against time are given for regions
    near and show that its variation is in the direction to be
    expected from the ionospheric data
