thermal and gravitational atmospheric oscillations
    ionospheric dynamo effects included the resonance theory of
    gravitational and thermal oscillations in a rotating atmosphere
    is extended to include an electron and positive ion gas with a
    permanent magnetic field superposed expressions are obtained
    for the variation with height of the electric field current
    density and ion drift velocitile some comparisons are made with
    observed ionospheric data
