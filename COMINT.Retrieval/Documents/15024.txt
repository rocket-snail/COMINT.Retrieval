calculations with noise voltages part passage of noise
    voltages through nonlinear elements the correlation function is
    used to calculate the modification suffered by a noise spectrum
    on passing through a quadripole with nonlinear elements the
    method is based on that of rice the quadripole characteristic
    is represented as an integral the relation between the
    correlation functions for input and output voltages is in the
    form of a double integral which can be expanded in a power
    series simple expressions are obtained when the quadripole
    characteristic comprises a sum of hermite polynomials an
    introduction to the various parameters used is given in
