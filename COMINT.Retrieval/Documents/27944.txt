the edge conditions and field representation theorems in
    the theory of electromagnetic diffraction discussion is
    presented relevant to the case of a perfectly conducting screen
    of infinite extent with an aperture of finite area order
    conditions are developed which must be satisfied by the field
    components in the neighbourhood of the edge as a consequence of
    the requirement that the total energy in a finite c volume must
    be finite the boundary value problem is formulated as a pair of
    simultaneous integral equations from the solution for the edge
    region the functional form of the local fields can be
    determined without assuming a particular type of expansion an
    indeterminacy present in the system of local integral equations
    can be removed when the local behaviour of certain field
    components is known in detail
