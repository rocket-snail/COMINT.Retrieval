a theory of electrostatic fields in the ionosphere at
    nonpolar geomagnetic latitudes es coupling between the dynamo
    and f regions and between magnetically conjugate parts of the
    regions themselves the electric source field produced by winds
    in the dynamo region and the possibility of significant
    electron density variations in the f region due to es fields
    are examined
