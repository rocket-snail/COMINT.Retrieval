do libraries have political duties?. many tasks
    undertaken by public libraries are political, not because they
    promote party politics but because they provide enlightenment
    and pleasure for each individual in a free democracy. culture
    involves not only beauty but also social reality. librarians
    must help all handicapped people; germany is ahead of france in
    library work with the physically handicapped and provision of
    library facilities for foreign workers certainly involves both
    culture and politics. the libraries must promote reading, or
    books may be ousted by audio-visual media. stock selection
    criteria must be those of truth and objectivity; the librarian
    must be mindful of all viewpoints, since freedom permits
    opposition.
