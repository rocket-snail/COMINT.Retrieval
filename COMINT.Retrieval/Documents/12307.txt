welded joints on diodes reduce computer bulk diode
    mounting methods are discussed teking up the least possible
    space while affording adequate accessibility by using spot
    welding the diode leads can be shortened to an elongated matrix
    and a honeycomb arrangement accommodating up to diodes are
    among the alternatives described
