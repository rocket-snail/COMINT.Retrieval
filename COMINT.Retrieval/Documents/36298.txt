optimizing the evaluation of calculus expressions in a
    relational database system. the tgr experimental relational
    data base system is described. its use of microprogrammed data
    base primitives and optimisation features is intended to
    increase the speed of retrieval. the feedback-optimisation
    strategy is illustrated using 2-variable expressions and
    arbitrary (multi-variable) expressions. the use of filters and
    their rules for construction are described, and illustrated in
    the conjunctive normal form. tgr is briefly compared with
    damas, and its implementation using the bclp language
    described. statistics on performance show that the
    feedback-optimisation is best suited for queries involving many
    relations and performance is poor with large relations, it
    cannot therefore be used as a stand-alone optimisation method.
    more research is needed to select the right options.
