bibliographic access for microform collections.
    bibliographic access to individual titles in microform
    collections is a problem. neither the library of congress nor
    most micropublishers fully analyse these collections.
    individual libraries cannot afford to do so either. but without
    author and title access, these collections are not very useful.
    full analytics for microform collections have been called for
    but no effort yet has been successful. suggests that libraries
    abandon full cataloguing in favour of indexing, using the
    information provided by micropublishers. while a national index
    to the contents of microform collections would be best, an
    alternative for local libraries would be to create their own
    com index.
