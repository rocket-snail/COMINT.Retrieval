miniaturized tantalum solid electrolytic capacitors the
    replacement of an aqueous electrolyte by an oxide film results
    in an improvement in the low temperature characteristics and an
    extension of the frequency range these capacitors also have the
    advantage of storing more charge per unit volume than previous
    types
