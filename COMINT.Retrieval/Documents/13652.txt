using modern library and bibliographical classification
    schemes in specialised computer-based information retrieval
    systems. there are 3 different approaches to the use of
    indexing languages based on classification schemes for
    searching computer files for subject requests. the mechanical
    approach simply extends the principle of the card catalogue;
    the coordinated approach uses as a search format a list of
    classification features each serving a heuristic function; the
    integral approach provides a synthesis of classification and
    word languages without the drawbacks of the other 2, and offers
    the most long-term possibilities. detailed examples show the
    operation of each approach.
