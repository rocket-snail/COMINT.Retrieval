quantum theory of galvanomagnetic effects a study is made
    of the effect of the quantization of the electron orbits in a
    magnetic field on the galvanomagnetic properties of an
    isotropic semiconductor or semimetal in the phonon scattering
    range the conductivity tensor is calculated using the quantum
    mechanical density operator the hall coefficient and transverse
    resistivity are studied for a number of different sets of
    conditions for electron density magnetic field and
    temperature
