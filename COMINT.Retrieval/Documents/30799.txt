on the professional ethics of the librarian from the
    viewpoint of education and training. socialist library systems
    aim to improve the educational level of the people in all
    subjects, to provide sound communist training and to support
    the further growth of socialist society. the education and
    training of librarians must, therefore, be in accordance with
    these objectives. the librarian has a responsibility to society
    to provide for the growing demand for literature and
    information, to further research study and to support socialist
    education. whatever branch of library work the student will
    eventually be involved in, training should not be restricted to
    learning facts and library methodology techniques but should
    also provide a flexible training in the socio-economic aspects
    of library work. a librarian should be able to relate his
    particular social role in his branch of library work to the
    socialist library system as a whole.
