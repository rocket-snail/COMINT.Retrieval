selenium rectifiers with artificial layers of selenides
    of cadmium tin bismuth and lead the action of various selenides
    as barrier layers has been investigated by measurement of the
    rectifier dc and ac characteristics cdse and snse layers play
    an important role in rectification but the selenides of bi and
    pb seem to be unsuitable in general the layer material should
    have a resistivity cm
