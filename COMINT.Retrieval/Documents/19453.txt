observations of the van allen radiation regions during
    august and september part the inner belt ionization chamber and
    gm counter data from explorer are used to obtain the two
    constants in an assumed energy spectrum for inner belt protons
    of the form electron fluxes of low energy are estimated from
    scintillation counts
