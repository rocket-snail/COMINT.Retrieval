libraries as municipal information centres; the danish
    experience. talk given to the 14th nordic library meeting held
    in stockholm aug 80. the danish local authority reforms of 1970
    and the local authority planning act of 1977, which extended
    the democratic principle, intensified the demand for a more
    efficient public information service. to satisfy this demand
    the state information office for distribution of government
    information was set up in 1977 and cooperation with libraries
    established. the report on 'local participatory democracy'
    stimulated the development of public information services in
    libraries. the 'kommune-information' at the town library of
    lyngby-taarbaek was set up in 1977. it is placed close to the
    reference room and staffed by 1 full-time librarian. close
    cooperation with the town hall exists and contact persons in
    each department were appointed. all material automatically sent
    to kommune-information is catalogued and displayed and some may
    be borrowed. an informatio n index of local items is being
    built up. around 400 enquiries a month are dealt with, some by
    reference to the relevant department, others directly,
    concerning' decisions made, rights and duties, on-going
    projects, local groups and societies. despite the need few
    other local authorities have followed this example.
