the issue control is riddled with errors. statements by
    the danish librarians' union show that librarians know nothing
    about work in the technical departments and issue desks, where
    office trained staff, not librarians, work; they therefore tend
    to reject automation in these areas. they are, on the other
    hand, trained in bibliographical services and hence approve of
    automation of these. the fact is, however, that present manual
    issue control systems are working very poorly' books are being
    recalled which are already returned or have never been
    borrowed. refers to a neglected report of 1979 by a committee
    of heads of issue desks, which recommends experiments with
    automated issue control systems and in particular supports an
    automatic recall system. the issue desk staff of the automated
    olstykke library have also expressed positive views on their
    automatic system, views for which they have been reprimanded by
    the librarians' union.
