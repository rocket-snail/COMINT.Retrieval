library science and history' a dialectical approach.
    criticises conventional studies of library history for failing
    to appreciate that libraries are essentially part of an
    interlocking complex of institutions forming a particular
    social structure, which itself is determined by the historical
    process. shows how dialectical materialism can be used to deal
    with social entities as part of a totality of positive and
    negative factors, and emphasises the necessity of viewing
    history as a process and not as finite. once this is
    understood, it becomes possible to place the study of libraries
    on a recognisable scientific basis, as a complex of practices
    which are ultimately socially determined.
