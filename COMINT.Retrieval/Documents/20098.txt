a basic transistor circuit for the construction of
    digital computing systems a circuit comprising one transistor
    one capacitor and three resistors forms the basis of a complete
    digital computing system for use where high operation speed is
    not essential the construction of well known computer circuits
    from the basic circuit is described and a complete logical
    computing system using circuits is developed to demonstrate
    their application
