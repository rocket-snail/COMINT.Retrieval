theoretical and experimental study of electromagnetic
    scattering by two identical conducting cylinders the scattering
    of a cylindrical tem wave by two parallel identical conducting
    circular cylinders is developed as a special case of a
    theoretical analysis which treats the scattering by an
    arbitrary array of cylinders only the case with the incident e
    vector parallel to the axes of the cylinders is considered and
    attention is focused on the mutual effects present when the
    cylinder diameter and spacing are comparable to a wavelength
    the approximations made in the theory are tested experimentally
    using microwaves in a parallel plate region significant
    departures from the results of the independent scattering
    hypothesis as predicted by the theory have been confirmed
    experimentally
