the accuracy of the determination of reflection heights
    and distances of atmospherics on the basis of their waveform
    the errors in calculating reflection height h and distance d of
    atmospherics are investigated as a function of the ratio hd and
    of the reflection modes a recorded waveform is analysed and
    results are tabulated see also
