dc amplifiers with low pass feedback brockelsby of and
    mayr of have shown how to design a voltage amplifier of high
    stability and with a response curve of maximum flatness but
    their method has the disadvantage that the amplifier must have
    a particular value of loop gain if the loop gain is varied the
    overall frequency response will be seriously affected and the
    amplifier may be unstable if used as an integrator or
    differentiator the method is extended to cover the case of a dc
    amplifier with a low pass feedback network the gain of such an
    amplifier can be varied over a wide range without appreciable
    effect on the overall frequency response so that it can be used
    as a stable differentiator or integrator the output noise level
    may limit the field of application
