the fate of our graphic records depends on. discusses
    some steps which us librarians are taking to try and solve the
    problem of the rapid deterioration of graphic materials. argues
    that librarianship education during the last decade has been
    emphasising services, administration, advanced technologies and
    nonprint media, and paid little attention to the transmission
    of ideas, and the causes which lead to the disappearance,
    preservation, and reinterpretation of these ideas. urges
    librarians to share and value a sense of history, which is seen
    as the one and most important unifying element which will
    decide the fate of their graphic records.
