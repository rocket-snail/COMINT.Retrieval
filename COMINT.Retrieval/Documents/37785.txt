electronic interaction between adsorbed gas molecules and
    metal surfaces the interaction is discussed in terms of the
    structure of the gas molecules and the work function of the
    metal experimental investigations based on the variation of
    photoelectric sensitivity and resistance of thin films of the
    metal on adsorption of the gas are described metals used were
    ni and pt gases were water vapour and benzene vapour the
    investigation is relevant to the problem of conduction at the
    surface of semiconductors
