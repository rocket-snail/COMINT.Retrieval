mutual synchronization of three coupled oscillators with
    weak couplings the syst m investigated theoretically and
    experimentally comprises three triode valve oscillators coupled
    by small capacitors between the grids of the first and second
    and second and third valves approximate expressions are derived
    for the frequency and amplitude of the oscillations in each
    oscillator the regions where mutual synchronization takes place
    are shown in a graph where are respectively the frequency
    differences between the first and second and the third and
    second oscillators
