a new self excited square wave transistor power
    oscillator the basic circuit uses a push pull arrangement of
    power transistors in conjunction with a transformer consisting
    of a centre tapped primary centre tapped feedback and output
    winding and a single source an explanation of the operation and
    oscillograms of waveforms obtained are presented good
    efficiency is obtained over a frequency range the range has
    been extended up to with reduced efficiency application to
    conversion of power is discussed
