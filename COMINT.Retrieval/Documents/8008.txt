bifurcation of the e region the retardation time relative
    to an uhf reference signal of a radio signal of frequency about
    above the critical frequency was measured by rocket borne
    instruments electron density altitude graphs were derived from
    the retardation time time of flight records bifurcation of the
    e layer is clearly indicated the results are in close agreement
    with those calculated from records obtained with the nbs model
    c ionosphere recorder the separation of the electron density
    maxima was km
