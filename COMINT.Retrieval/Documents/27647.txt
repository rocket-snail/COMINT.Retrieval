library data collection handbook. describes basic
    management information useful in academic, public, school, and
    special libraries. an underlying premise of the handbook is
    that all types of libraries have a common set of functions,
    purposes, and resources which outweigh the differences in
    setting, size, or organisational goals. presents a set of
    categories of information that are judged to be important in
    describing the library, and provides definition of those
    categories.
