the book of the future. part of the text of a preliminary
    discussion paper prepared by unesco for the 1982 world congress
    of books. modern technology is changing the nature of the book
    and its traditional role as the chief means of transmitting
    knowledge. the possibilities raised by microforms and computers
    are surveyed, in relation to the contrasting situations in the
    industrialised and developing countries. the serious problems
    created by paper shortage, despite increased production in some
    areas, are examined, with statistical data showing production
    and consumption in 1st and 3rd world countries. the tendency
    appears now to be towards 2 different kinds of books, 1 for the
    elite and the other for the masses. in conclusion the necessity
    for concerted action to ensure the future of the book is
    urged.
