structure and movement of large inhomogeneities in the
    ionospheric f layer simultaneous measurements have been made
    using three receivers km apart of the phase and angle of
    arrival of waves reflected from the f layer the size and shape
    of inhomogeneities and drift velocities have been
    calculated
