transmission and reflection of electromagnetic waves at a
    plasma boundary for arbitrary angles of incidence a plane em
    wave horizontally or vertically polarized incident at an
    arbitrary angle on a flat plasma boundary is investigated
    numerical results showing variation of attenuation and phase
    power entering the plasma and ellipticity of the reflected wave
    are presented
