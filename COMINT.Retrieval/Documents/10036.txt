radar determination of the height of disappearance of
    meteor trails of known radiant observations were made during
    the period august at meudon using radar equipment operating on
    a wavelength of with a peak power of about curves representing
    the time variation of the distance of the theoretically nearest
    reflection point for various values of the height at which the
    trails disappear are shown together with observed nearest
    reflection points from the comparison it is deduced that the
    mean value of h is about km
