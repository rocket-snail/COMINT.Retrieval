the transient response of direct current amplifier
    systems dc amplifiers of the dc ac conversion type have an
    upper frequency response limited by the detector circuit and
    when negative feedback is used transients are amplified
    considerably more than the steady signal the form of the
    transient response and methods of reducing its magnitude ar
