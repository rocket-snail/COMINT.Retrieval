theory of pulling in by a small amplitude external force
    a method is developed for calculating the effect of small
    periodic external forces on an oscillating system the method is
    illustrated by considering the effect of a small sinusoidal
    voltage of frequency on a valve oscillator with a natural
    frequency the difference between the frequencies being
    small
