data quality in information systems. until recently, data
    quality was poorly understood and seldom achieved, yet it is
    essential to the effective use of information systems.
    discusses the nature and importance of data quality. the role

    concepts, tools and techniques from both programming languages
    and data base management systems are presented and related to
    data quality. in particular, the concept of a data base
    constraint is considered in detail. some current limitations
    and research directions are proposed.
