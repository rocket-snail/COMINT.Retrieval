does trondheim need a public library? open letter to the
    party members in the town council. the staff of trondheim
    public library, norway, consider the latest postponement (till
    after 1982) of the planned new library totally irresponsible.
    having long tolerated unsatisfactory conditions in the
    expectation of improvement, they now demand that the present
    library should be brought up to current standards of health and
    work environment conditions, though even this would not meet
    the needs of the local community. much of the bookstock is
    housed elsewhere for lack of space, which together with staff
    shortages makes for unsatisfactory public service. it is
    impossible to extend services to the elderly, handicapped and
    other disadvantaged groups. only a new library can bring
    trondheim into line with other norwegian city library
    services.
