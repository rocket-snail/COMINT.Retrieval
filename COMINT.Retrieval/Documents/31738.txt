possibility of determining the potential distribution of
    a plasma from the characteristics of the noise generated in a
    gaseous discharge a note of noise measurements made on oxide
    cathode discharges in krypton at pressures and at discharge
    currents the variation of potential along the axis of the
    discharge is in close agreement with results obtained by
    conventional probe methods
