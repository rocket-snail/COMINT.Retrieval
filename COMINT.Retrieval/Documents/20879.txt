a broad back and a terrier's head: an interview with the
    head of a local voluntary library. in the outskirts of
    monnickendam in the netherlands a public library run entirely
    by unpaid volunteers was founded in 1973. the collection was
    started with the purchase of a bankrupt stock of books at
    minimal cost and is presently housed in a former school. it now
    totals 14,500 volumes and loans have risen from 10,163 in 1973
    to 60,368 in 1980. the library has separate adult and
    children's sections and staff make regular visits to local
    schools. it has close links with the town library with which it
    is planned to merge formally in the near future. mrs van driel,
    head of the library, recognises the important contribution of
    her voluntary assistants, adding that the essential
    qualification of a volunteer is 'a broad back and the head of a
    terrier'.
