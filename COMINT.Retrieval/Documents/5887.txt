constitution of polar magnetic storms analysis of data
    obtained in the international polar year indicates that polar
    magnetic storms consist of a number of elementary disturbances
    which occur successively the equivalent current system
    corresponding to these disturbances can be represented
    approximately by that due to an electric dipole located in the
    auroral zone
