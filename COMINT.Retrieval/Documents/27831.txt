theory of forced oscillations in electromagnetic cavities
    and the equivalent circuit of a cavity the em field inside an
    excited cavity coupled to a two way transmission line is
    calculated on the basis of a series expansion of arbitrary
    vector fields in cavity resonators in terms of orthogonal
    eigenfunctions the equivalent circuit derived consists of an
    infinite number of lumped elements approximation formulae for
    practical application are given
