a mathematical technique for the analysis of linear
    systems the technique of the transformation developed for
    investigating sampled data systems is applied to the numerical
    solution of continuous linear systems a model of the linear
    system is devised in which sampling is introduced at some
    convenient point a polygonal approximation to the sampled
    function is reconstructed by means of a holding operator and
    the output of the system is computed as a train of
    pulses
