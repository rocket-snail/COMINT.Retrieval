information on the ionizing radiation of solar flares
    from the ionospheric absorption effect the additional
    ionization is produced in a thin layer at height and the
    attachment coefficient is sec the radiation flux deduced from
    the ionospheric changes agrees well with rocket measurements
    the spectrum of the ionizing radiation is probably mainly line
    emission near
