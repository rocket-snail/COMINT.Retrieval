parallel tuned circuit periodically switched to a direct
    current source circuit phenomena with the switch closed open
    are analysed in turn linear solutions being obtained the
    complete solution is then obtained by matching the boundary
    conditions for the two cases this solution includes sinusoidal
    sawtooth and complex waveforms dependent on circuit parameters
    and switching period elimination of dissipative circuit
    elements simplifies the general solution with resulting
    clarification of the operation of the circuit tests with a
    mechanically switched circuit verified the theory the entire
    gamut of waveforms being obtained by variation of circuit
    parameters and switching period
