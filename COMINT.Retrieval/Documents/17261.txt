a high speed logic system using magnetic elements and
    connecting wire only square loop magnetic elements having multi
    aperture or multipath variations of the toroid shape are used
    to provide unilateral information flow properties information
    bit rates above have been obtained with commercial ferrite
    material advantages include simplicity of wiring and the
    inherent nondestructive read out properties of the
    system
