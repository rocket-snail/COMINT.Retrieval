increasing information retrieval precision. isolates 6
    pairs of inter-related factors (information and user, document
    and search descriptions, descriptor and subject word, object
    and process, higher- and lower-rank concepts, and selection and
    reduction), some of which may interfere with scientific and
    technical information retrieval precision (especially in
    computerised systems). to eliminate such interference, proposes
    that' a formula specifying information need more precisely
    should be introduced; while indexing, subject (rather than
    document) content should be described; concept characteristics,
    rather than unified key words, should be used; process-oriented
    words should be used to describe changes in time; higher-rank
    concepts should be used only if they adequately cover all
    subordinated concepts; and elements for information retrieval
    should not be mixed with those aimed at content
    description.
