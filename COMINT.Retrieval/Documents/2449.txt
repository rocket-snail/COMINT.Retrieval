socialist library services in the gdr. summary of a
    thesis presented to the sittard school of library and
    information studies in 1980. east germany has a highly
    developed network of public libraries. in each of the country's
    14 regions central libraries have been designated to act as
    regional support centres for the smaller district and local
    community libraries. library services are governed by the state
    library act of 1968 and all libraries are members of the east
    german union of libraries. in contrast to libraries in western
    europe libraries in east germany have a strong political
    character and are compelled by law to support the socialist
    economic system. all libraries are run by a library council
    with representatives drawn from users, local organisations and
    other libraries.
