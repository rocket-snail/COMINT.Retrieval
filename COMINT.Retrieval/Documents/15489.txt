libraries after the 10th party conference. a development
    plan for trades union libraries in 1981 was drawn up to further
    scientific and technical progress; the plan's effect on the
    library in veb kombinat narva, an east berlin electric light
    bulb factory is described. close cooperation is advocated with
    the collectives and with other cultural organisations and the
    expansion of stocks and information services. students at the
    industrial training school were to be introduced to the library
    services at the start of their courses and suitable literature
    provided for industrial and political studies and for leisure
    activities. as a result several apprentice classes made visits
    to the library and more literary events and displays were
    organised. it is hoped that 1981 loans will increase to 75,000
    and that at least 55% of workers under 25 will be registered
    library members.
