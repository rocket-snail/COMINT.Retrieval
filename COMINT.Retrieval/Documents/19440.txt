current element near the edge of a conducting half plane
    the two dimensional problem of the maxwellian field from a line
    source of current adjacent to conducting half plane is treated
    by a transform method of solution expressions in the form of
    contour integrals are given for the current induced in the
    conductor and for the radiated field
