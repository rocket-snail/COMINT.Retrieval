ifla challenges to action in the year of the disabled.
    the 46th ifla conference (manila, aug 80), the 1st held in a
    developing country, aroused unusual interest among filipino
    librarians and media. ifla's objectives of extending
    international understanding, cooperation, debate, research and
    development in all fields of librarianship, currently through
    its programmes universal bibliographic control and universal
    availability of publications was emphasised. access to
    information is essential for a country's social and economic
    development, final responsibility for this resting with the
    government. while the year of the child must be followed up
    especially in developing countries, the year of the disabled is
    a reminder that handicapped people in all countries lack equal
    opportunities with other reading groups. worldwide economic
    difficulties must not inhibit the search for new ideas.
    challenges all library organisations to focus attention in 1981
    particularly on the library need of blind and other handicapped
    readers.
