dielectric properties of a lattice of anisotropic
    particles analysis is presented for a uniform lattice of
    similarly oriented particles of arbitrary shape and material
    the packing density is assumed to be such that interaction
    between particles must be considered but the induced fields can
    still be regarded as simple dipole fields two particular cases
    are examined a cubic array of ferrite spheres and a tetragonal
    array of disks in the latter case the calculated values of
    dielectric constant are in good agreement with experimental
    results reported by
