pulse compression a method is described for compressing
    frequency modulated rf pulses ie shortening them and increasing
    their amplitude by passing them through a delay distortion
    network consisting of a chain of lattice quadripoles the theory
    outlined is based on work by caucer published posthumously its
    practical application in the field of radar should result in
    higher resolving power for a given signal noise ratio
