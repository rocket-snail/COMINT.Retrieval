spherical frustum cavities symmetrical spherical frustum
    cavities are studied as intermediate cases between the sphere
    and the cylinder resonance wavelengths and factors are
    determined by abeles method a wavemeter using a hemispherical
    cavity partly filled with is proposed curves are presented
    showing the variation of with cavity size for and
