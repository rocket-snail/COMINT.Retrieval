the residual time constant of self saturating
    transductors theoretical and experimental evidence is presented
    indicating that the main winding of selfsaturating transductor
    influences the time constant for small signals to an extent
    dependent on the blocking intervals of the rectifiers and on
    the main winding resistance the blocking interval is in turn
    dependent on the output amplitude this is consistent with the
    normal experience that transductor response becomes faster as
    the output increases
