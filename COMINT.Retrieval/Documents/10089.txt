    corporation's on-line library information system and plans for
    its future development. started in 1977, the system was
    developed for academic libraries, but has accommodated the
    public library situation. it is adapted at specific points to
    individual library policy. it carries out standard library
    functions and also contains a public query module whereby a

    his personal record or (no identification needed) the
    bibliographic file.
