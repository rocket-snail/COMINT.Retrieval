stark effect at and millimetres wavelength nitric oxide
    stark effect measurements have been made for the first time in
    the mm wave region results of stark effect measurements on the
    and transitions of the ground state of falling at and mm
    respectively are reported and are shown to fit closely existing
    theory the electric dipole moment of no in the ground state is
    found to be debye unit
