on the theory of stationary waves in plasmas a
    mathematical treatment is presented appropriate to the case of
    a continuous non vanishing distribution of particle velocities
    a complete set of stationary plane wave solutions can be
    constructed there is no dispersion equation because for a given
    wave vector a continuous range of values of frequency is
    possible
