on the question of the continental effect of the f layer
    analysis of f data indicates an increase in day time ionization
    during the summer months observed by u s s r stations in
    central asia compared with data obtained by west european
    stations the evening rise in f appears much less pronounced for
    stations in central asia where the maximum usually occurs at
    local noon this continental effect causes difficulties in the
    interpolation required for the preparation of m u f
    charts
