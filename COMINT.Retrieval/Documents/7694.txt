a study of the total electron content of the region of
    the ionosphere over ahmedabad the total number of electrons in
    a column of unit cross section in the and regions up to the
    height of maximum electron density has been calculated for
    three magnetically quiet and three disturbed days in each month
    from the method of analysis is that suggested by assuming
    parabolic electron density distribution the relation between
    the semi thickness and for the layer shows that thick layers
    are associated with higher values of and that the parabolic
    distribution law does not hold for very thick layers
