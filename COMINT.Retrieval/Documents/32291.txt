multiple quantum transitions in paramagnetic resonance at
    high rf field strengths the normal paramagnetic resonance
    spectrum of in cubic mgo is found to be modified by additional
    absorption lines which are interpreted as double quantum
    transitions occurring between nearly equally spaced energy
    levels at high rf power calculation of the relative absorption
    intensity for which transitions agrees with experimental
    results
