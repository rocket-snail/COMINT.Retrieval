the library in higher professional education: an
    educational approach. in 1972 a survey of libraries in colleges
    of higher professional education in the netherlands revealed a
    low standard of library provision. as a result the state
    library advisory council has published a number of proposals
    for the improvement of services. modern trends in higher
    education, such as increased student numbers and new methods in
    teaching, have had a profound effect on the colleges of higher
    professional education. libraries of these colleges must now
    become information centres, easily accessible to all students
    and equipped with adequate catalogues. college librarians will
    need to pay increasing attention to the acquisition of reports,
    conference proceedings and audio-visual materials and should
    provide courses of formal instruction for staff and students in
    the use of library services.
