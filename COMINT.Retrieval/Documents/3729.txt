    lecture given at the ifla/unesco seminar in leipzig, aug 81. in
    the gambia library work with children is given priority over
    that with adults to encourage the spread of literacy. the
    service must provide material to help with formal schooling,
    encourage creative and emotional development and assist
    children in finding information. children's departments in
    public libraries cater for the 11-19 year olds; an attractive
    appearance is maintained and extra activities like story hours
    and film shows are provided. the national library has central
    control over children's libraries, providing school library
    stocks and advice and training for staff. assistance is also
    provided by the british council. more books are required; there
    are few modern publishing services in the gambia. more money is
    needed, especially for primary school libraries and more
    cooperation between librarians and teachers.
