some factors affecting the radio determination of
    meteoric velocities questions raised by hoffmeister of february
    are discussed further deceleration of meteors along the path
    prior to the point of measurement may br an important factor
    techniques for measuring the deceleration over an appreciable
    path length by the radio amplitude time method require to be
    developed existing techniques may be failing to detect faint
    meteors with hyperbolic orbits
