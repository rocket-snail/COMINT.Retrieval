the processing and some characteristics of coaxial
    cylinder corona stabilizer tubes the running voltage of tubes
    filled with hydrogen has been found to be stable to within over
    and to within over h the dependence of slope resistance on
    pressure and current has been investigated the temperature
    coefficient of running voltage is about per deg c it may be
    possible to obtain higher current by glow discharge
