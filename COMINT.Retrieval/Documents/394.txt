predictable design of transistor amplifiers the transfer
    characteristic of a multistage low frequency amplifier using
    junction transistors may be made independent of the transistor
    characteristics by the use of degenerative current feedback at
    the same time improving linearity the importance of stable
    biasing arrangements is emphasized
