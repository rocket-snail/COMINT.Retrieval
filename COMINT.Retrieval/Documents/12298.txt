the return difference matrix in linear networks bodes
    concept of the return difference is generalized by replacing
    the quantities concerned by matrices a formula for the
    fractionated gain is derived which is a generalisation of
    thevenins theorem formulae are also derived for the stability
    of a circuit for the variation of its output as a result of
    imperfections of the circuit elements and for the input and
    output impedance the method is particularly useful for
    analysing multiple loop feedback circuits
