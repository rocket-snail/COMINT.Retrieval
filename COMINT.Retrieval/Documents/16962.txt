    computerisation policy for the norwegian association of
    municipal library workers. data and telecommunication
    technology opens new possibilities in dissemination of
    information, and public libraries must take part. the principle
    of free access to information, knowledge and culture must be
    upheld. state, local government and private information
    data-bases must be accessible to the public. library resources
    must be considered as a whole, and all public libraries
    governed by one directorate. the national bibliography must be
    the starting-point for any system of public library data-bases.
    the anonymity of the borrower should be safeguarded. trade
    unions say that any loss of jobs through computerisation must
    be balanced by new jobs in other areas, preferably releasing
    staff for improved reader service. existing documents on the
    influence of automation must be implemented. there must be a
    specific statement regarding employer/employee relations in
    public libraries, and working conditions must not deteriorate.
    computers must not be used to oversee employees' work
    efficiency. staff must receive full instruction on the
    technology and functions of the computer system.
