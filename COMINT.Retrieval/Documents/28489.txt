mirror and azimuthal drift frequencies for
    geomagnetically trapped particles the charged particles trapped
    in the geomagnetic field the frequencies of the mirror
    oscillations and the azimuthal drift are defined as appropriate
    averages over the helical motion around the field lines and the
    mirror motion between reflection points in the two magnetic
    hemispheres these integrals for and are evaluated numerically
    results are tabulated illustrated and represented by
    approximate analytical expressions
