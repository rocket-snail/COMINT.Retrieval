special collections in the library of congress. the
    special collections included in this guide comprise
    thematically related groups of material maintained as separate
    units with the general holdings of the library of congress.
    they were either acquired as a unit or specifically assembled
    by the library. although valuable resources, these collections
    are often challenging to use as they are not recorded in a
    single card catalogue or machine-readable data base but rather
    in a variety of bibliographic guides. furthermore, some special
    collections are so vast that it is not feasible to provide an
    item-by-item listing. seeks to guide the researcher to
    resources that might otherwise be overlooked and describes
    special collections that have been singled out by the library's
    reference staff for their rarity or potential interest to
    scholars and summarises the history, content, scope, subject
    strengths and organisation of these groups of materials. though
    limited to 269 of the many special collecti ons, it illustrates
    an approach that can be applied for the effective use of
    similar resources.
