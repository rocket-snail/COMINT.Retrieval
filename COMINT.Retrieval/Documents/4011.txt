aacr2' oclc's implementation and database conversion.
    oclc's online union catalog (oluc) contains bibliographic
    records created under various cataloguing guidelines. until dec
    80, no system-wide attempt had been made to resolve record
    conflicts caused by use of the different guidelines. the
    introduction of the new guidelines, aacr2, exacerbated these
    record conflicts. to reduce library costs, which might increase
    dramatically as users attempted to resolve those conflicts,
    oclc converted name headings and uniform titles in its data
    base to aacr2 form.
