a novel microwave attenuator using germanium the device
    comprises a thin rectangular slab of ge set obliquely across a
    waveguide with current leads attached to the two ends and a
    magnetic field applied parallel to the face of the slab so as
    to control the concentration of current carriers as described
    by weisshaar and welker of attenuation of db was obtained with
    a pulsed control current of
