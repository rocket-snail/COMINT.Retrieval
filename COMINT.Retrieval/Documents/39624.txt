a continuously variable band pass filter for the audio
    frequency range the design of a band pass filter whose
    bandwidth and lower cut off frequency are continuously variable
    is described the requisite crystal filters are derived from the
    band pass elements given by image parameter theory the
    equipment and some of its response curves are
    illustrated
