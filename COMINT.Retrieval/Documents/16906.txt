the structure of social science literature as shown by a
    large-scale citation analysis. to collect information relevant
    to the improvement of secondary services, an analysis of 59,000
    citations in the social sciences was conducted-11,000 taken
    from 300 monographs, and 48,000 from 140 serials, including 47
    highly cited titles and 47 taken at random. large differences
    were apparent between analyses of referenes taken from serials
    and those from monographs, and smaller differences between
    analyses of references from highly cited and randomly chosen
    serials. there were also great differences between subjects;
    most of these differenes have implications for the planning of
    secondary services. the results imply that secondary services
    in the social sciences are deficient in the range of forms of
    material they cover, in the number and possibly the selection
    of serials covered, in the subject spread of material of
    possible relevance, and probably also of foreign language
    material and material published in many other countries.
