the national bibliographic situation' future plans and
    priorities for national bibliographical work. 2norsk
    bokfortegnelse1, the major component of the norwegian national
    bibliography, comprises material received through legal deposit
    or donation by oslo university's norwegian department. it has
    been computer-produced since 1972. norwegian book production
    increased by 105% during 1970-78, while norwegian participation
    in ubc and isds has necessitated the introduction of aacr, isbd
    and isbn. staffing has not been increased proportionately, and
    considerable arrears of uncatalogued material exist. the
    5-yearly cumulation for 1971-75 is at present available in
    machine-readable form only. a microfiche catalogue of norwegian
    publications is produced bi-monthly, with cumulations for
    1971-75 and 1976-78. the university library's national
    bibliography data base is already partly on-line. indexing of
    periodical articles, planned from 1980, will cover 400
    periodicals in most subject fields. newspape r articles cannot
    be covered meanwhile. the 2bibliography of norwegian government
    publications1 (1965-) should soon be incorporated into the data
    base. foreign publications about norway (1978-) are indexed in
    machine-readable form.
