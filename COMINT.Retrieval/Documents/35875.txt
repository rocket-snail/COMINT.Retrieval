investigations of current noise in resistors report of
    noise voltage measurements over the frequency range kcs with
    film resistors the mean square noise voltage usually varies
    approximately inversely as frequency for resistors exhibiting
    such a frequency variation the noise is proportional to the
    direct voltage applied deviations from this frequency
    dependence are accompanied by deviations from this voltage
    dependence as reported by macfarlane of the behaviour of wire
    resistors is similar the statistical distribution of amplitude
    of the current noise agrees with the distribution function for
    thermal noise indicating that its nature is gaussian
