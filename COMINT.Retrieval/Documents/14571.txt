the success-breeds-success phenomenon and bibliometric
    processes. success-breeds-success phenomenon is described by
    single- and multiple-urn models. it is shown that these models
    lead to a negative binomial distribution for the total number
    of successes and a zipf-mandelbrot law for the number of
    sources contributing a specified number of successes.
