theoretical world curves of maximum ion density in a
    quiet f region the curves plotted in terms of latitude and
    local time for solstice and equinox conditions are generally
    the same as those obtained from ionosonde date the analysis
    shows that diffusion plays a significant part in controlling f
    ionization
