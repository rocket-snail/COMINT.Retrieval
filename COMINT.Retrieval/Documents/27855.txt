stabilization of the magnetic field of an electromagnet a
    system is described for controlling both rapid and slow
    variations of the magnetic field by means of a transistorized
    control stage and feedback winding slow variations are detected
    by the magnetic resonance of protons in a ferric nitrate
    solution using a technique similar to that described
    earlier
