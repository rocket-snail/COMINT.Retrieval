transductors with four limbed cores transductors with
    four limbed cores have characteristics which differ from those
    of conventional transductors in their symmetry with respect to
    control current changes such transductors are suitable for
    increasing the sensitivity of non polarized relays and may be
    operated by either signals the suppression of response to
    negative signals is also possible with four limbed transductors
    and this may be used to reduce swamping effects in push pull
    magnetic amplifiers subjected to large signals inputs
