bulgarian and foreign literature on energy in the
    people's republic of bulgaria. a critical appraisal of
    literature on energy, available at present, in bulgarian
    libraries. all possible aspects are covered. foreign
    publications in this important field were predominantly french
    and german in the 1940s, but nowadays, 60% is written in
    russian followed by materials in english. during the past 20
    years, even the central regional libraries have established
    special collections on energy. major libraries have specialised
    in 3 areas. firstly, the central technical library and the
    library of the bulgarian academy of sciences have built up
    theoretical collections and others of specialist interest, e.g.
    on nuclear energy. secondly, reference publications are to be
    found mainly at the cyril and methodius national library while
    thirdly technical colleges and other establishments of higher
    technical education concentrate on all aspects of electrical
    power, installations, instruments, and so on. in all libraries,
    the staff responsible for new acquisitions must bear in mind
    the latest trends, e.g. conversion of chemical energy into
    light, where, so far, the literature available is almost
    negligible.
