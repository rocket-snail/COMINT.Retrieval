measurement of ionospheric drift by radio star
    observations the incidence of scintillations is greatest in the
    hours before sunrise at puerto rico it is not correlated with
    spread f or e the drift results show that the ionosphere
    irregularities causing scintillation are elongated along the
    lines of force of the geomagnetic field and that drift rather
    than random changes is the main source of scintillation
