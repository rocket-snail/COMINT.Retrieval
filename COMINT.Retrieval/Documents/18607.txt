cataloging and classification practices in community
    college libraries. results of a questionnaire survey sent to a
    sample of community college libraries in the us indicate that
    as these libraries enter the 1980s their collections are still
    traditionally organised. although audio-visual materials are
    now catalogued and classified, there is little agreement as to
    how they should be organised; and most audio-visual materials
    are still housed in closed-access areas. change to aacr 2 seems
    to be accepted, but librarians are still undecided about
    participating in computerised cataloguing networks.
