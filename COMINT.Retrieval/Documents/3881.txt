the enhancement of ionospheric ionization during solar
    flares study of the recombination coefficient in the lower
    ionosphere based on the decay of sudden phase anomalies at and
    on sudden enhancements of atmospherics gives values much
    smaller than those reported by bates and seaton measurements of
    the delay between the time of maximum flare and the times of
    maxima of sudden phase anomalies and sudden enhancements of
    atmospherics also suggest smaller values these results indicate
    that for any height the value of the recombination coefficient
    remains unaltered during a sudden ionospheric disturbance and
    that the sudden increase in electron concentration is due to an
    increase in the rate of electron production in the layer
