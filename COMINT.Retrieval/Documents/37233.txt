scopal. the 2nd session of the standing conference of
    pacific libraries (scopal) was held in suva in oct 79.
    questions were raised then as to whether it could operate as a
    professional association without a constitution, membership
    fees or overt competition for executive positions. its aims
    include the encouragement of library development, library
    projects and liaison within the pacific region, and to provide
    a communication channel for project workers and working groups.
    although it can operate on its present lines, scopal really
    embodies a 'spirit of regionalism' which from time to time
    motivates cooperation between individuals. its weakness is the
    lack of communication between its members. the spirit of
    regional information cooperation must take flesh in order to be
    seen and heard by governments and international bodies as well
    as by the librarians and communities which scopal
    serves.
