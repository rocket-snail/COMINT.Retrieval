toward the development of a library management
    information system. outlines an approach, with both widespread
    implications and specific practical steps, for assembling some
    of the data that library administrators now require in order to
    make libraries operate more effectively. these data have not
    been assembled in the past because the costs in staff time
    alone have been and continue to be prohibitive for most
    institutions. one major impediment to effective library
    administration is the lack of a comprehensive management
    information system. some investigators in this area seem to
    have become fascinated with the potential value of various
    elusive and fugitive library statistical measures, but they
    have given little attention to the operational systems that
    would be required to assemble these data. the proposal outlined
    here stresses the need for a total systems approach, based upon
    standardised terminology; machine-aided data collection, and
    customised computer processing and reporting as we ll as
    systematic training and documentation.
