waveform studies of electric field changes during cloud
    to cloud lightning discharges assuming that cloud to cloud
    discharges may be identified from the sign of the field change
    and the time separation of the individual strokes such
    discharges exhibit all the features known to be associated with
    ground discharges they include precursors multiple strokes
    return strokes slow field changes and hook components junction
    field changes between strokes
