abn and the art of cost-effective cataloguing: the
    challenge in library automation for the early eighties. the
    national library of australia has received permission to
    develop an australian bibliographic network (abn), but no extra
    resources have been granted for it; the service may therefore
    not be able to serve all its potential participants as quickly
    as some would like. suggests that through the creation of
    'service centre' networks, and without the need for a major
    supportive infrastructure from the national library, the
    benefits of the abn's existence can be brought to a great many
    libraries. suggests ways in which abn may be integrated into a
    national network which will coordinate the national library's
    initiatives and the 'bottom-up' developments which have already
    taken place and will continue to take place.
