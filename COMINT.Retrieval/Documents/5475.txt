distortion in feedback amplifiers analysis is presented
    for frequency dependent feedbacks consideration is re stricted
    to cases where the distortion products are comparatively small
    and the nonlinear elements can be described by a power series
    with only a few terms formulae are derived for a number of
    third order products
