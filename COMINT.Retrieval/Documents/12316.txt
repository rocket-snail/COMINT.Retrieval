on allocations to university libraries in the state of
    north rhine-westphalia in the period from 1975 to 1980. the new
    budget accounting system introduced in 1975 was successful and
    discrepancies between appropriations of financial allocations
    and expenditure were kept within limits. the total amount of
    allocations available to libraries for literature acquisition
    rose by 27%. library posts available during the period rose by
    7.7% (150 posts). most new personnel were concentrated in the
    new integrated university libraries and also in the traditional
    central libraries. over 3 million dm were made available for
    automation processes at libraries in 1980. altough many new
    library buildings were erected in the period there is still not
    sufficient space for accommodating all the necessary
    literature. financial allocations were increased for the
    university library centre, the central medical library
    (zentralbibliothek der medizin) and the institute of
    librarianship, although accommodation here is still
    unsatisfactory.
