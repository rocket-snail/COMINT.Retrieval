file as a dependable archivist. the current state of the
    art of information processing tends to link certain
    capabilities (such as protection of data integrity and
    confidentiality and monitoring user/data interactions) with
    large data base systems. this is most unfortunate, since such
    capabilities are frequently vital for modest applications which
    do not have the degree of data complexity to justify the use of
    large data base systems and which may not be able to afford
    them. describes an effort to bridge this gap in current
    electronic data processing technology by means of a new
    linguistic concept of files which is designed to simulate a
    dependable archivist rather than a passive filing
    cabinet.
