question marks surrounding the current bibliographic
    control of foreign published hungarica literature. describes
    the current bibliographic control of foreign published
    hungarica literature in both hungarian and foreign languages
    commencing with hungarika kulfoldi folyoiratszemle (hungarica
    foreign periodicals review) in 1970. books have only been
    registered since 1977. in its present form, bibliographic
    control undertakes more than it can reliably perform. the
    function of such bibliography is not clear and user demands do
    not appear to be met.
