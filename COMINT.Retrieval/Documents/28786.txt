the hybrid ring a hybrid circuit for very high
    frequencies input admittance and coupling attenuation are
    calculated as functions of frequency good agreement with
    measured values is obtained methods of increasing bandwidth are
    discussed and a practical arrangement is described for the band
    using a construction similar to microstrip
