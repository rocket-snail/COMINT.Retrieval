the increase ie frequency bandwidth of thin four layer
    absorbers for centimetre electromagnetic waves a type of
    absorber is investigated which can be made thinner than one
    thirty of the wavelength in free space if the dielectric
    constant or permeability of the lossy material is independent
    of frequency the effective bandwidth of the absorber decreases
    with absorber thickness to obtain a thin absorber covering a
    frequency range of ratio one two bielectric constant or
    permeability would have to follow a frequency law of the type
    given but no practical material is known which meets these
    requirements
