a new non reciprocal waveguide medium using ferrites a
    narrow ferrite strip is attached along the wall of a circular
    section waveguide and subjected to a transverse magnetic field
    a difference in phase constant exists for the two directions of
    transmission along the guide for suitable ferrite dimensions a
    nonreciprocal rotation of the plane of polarization of an em
    wave takes place a more complete theoretical explanation is to

    axial field has been considered by hogan of
