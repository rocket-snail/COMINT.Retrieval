modular indexing in a relationally based document
    retrieval system. when based on a single model, a document
    retrieval system may be coherently designed, convenient to use,
    and easy to maintain. the relational model provides a natural
    way of viewing document retrieval and has a sound theoretical
    foundation. a particular area of interest is indexing. all
    indexingtools (including negative dictionaries, stem
    dictionaries, and thesauri) are stored as relations and are
    manipulated using relational operations. this procedure means
    that, conceptually, all indexing is done at search time in a
    modular and dynamic fashion. describes this modular approach,
    gives examples, and summarises the advantages.
