terminology and equations for linear active four terminal
    networks including transistors a general system of terminology
    is developed for linear active quadripoles both nodal and loop
    analysis being presented definitions are given of current
    voltage and power amplification factors and the transformation
    equations are derived the results are applied to a number of
    transistor circuits the appropriate formulae being tabulated
    numerical examples are worked out
