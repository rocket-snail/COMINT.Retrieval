explanations of the bibliometric laws. many librarians
    are familiar with bradford's law of scattering as a description
    of how articles in a discipline are dispersed over the universe
    of journals. similar and equally surprising regularities are
    found in a wide range of other areas, such as biology,
    economics, geography, and linguistics. describes a number of
    the most prominent of these laws and reformulates them so as to
    reveal their underlying similarity. it is noted that all of
    these laws are in essence mathematically identical. reviews
    several attempts that have been made to derive this common
    regularity from more basic principles, such as an underlying
    stochastic process or an information theoretic model of the
    human mind.
