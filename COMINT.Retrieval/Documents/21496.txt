polarization measurements on three intense radio sources
    measurements have been made on radiation of wavelength from
    sources in cygnus cassiopeia and taurus the results indicate
    that there is no plane polarized component and no circularly
    polarized component in the flux from the first two of these
    sources the corresponding figures for the source in taurus are
    and respectively the george r agassiz radio telescope of
    harvard observatory the aerial of this instrument is a
    paraboloid of expanded aluminium wire mesh with a horn
    collector at the focus at wavelength the angular resolution is
    about thus the accuracy of setting and following is more than
    sufficient for research on discrete radio sources the receiver
    is a double conversion superheterodyne comparison radiometer
    with a channel comb filter at the second conversion frequency
    the instrument is to be used both for research and
    training
