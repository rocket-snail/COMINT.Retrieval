a marovian model of the university of michigan executive
    system a mathematical model of a computer's executive system is
    postulated and its parameters estimated with the aid of
    extensive data on the system's operation. although simplifying
    assumptions are made, the results predicted by the model agree
    reasonable well with actual results. the model is used to study
    the effects of changes in the executive system and in one of
    its compilers. further applications of the model are discussed.
