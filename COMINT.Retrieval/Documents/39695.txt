a receiver for radio astronomy and some observational
    results description of a superheterodyne receiver in which the
    hf amplifier contains two disk seal triode valves in cascode
    the effective cathode resistance of the second valve being made
    very high by a simple neutralization circuit a noise factor of
    has been obtained at radio astronomy observations are described
    which have been made with this receiver and the parabolic
    reflector at swingeloo an isophot chart of the sky drawn from
    these observations is reproduced
