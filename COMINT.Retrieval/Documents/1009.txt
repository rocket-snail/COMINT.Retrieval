teaching techniques for the use of libraries. school
    children need to learn how to use libraries and what is
    available in a library. surveys were carried out to find out
    what literature children read. based on the results of these
    surveys a course for teaching children techniques for the use
    of libraries was developed. the course consisted of classwork'
    analysing favourite books, discovering the contents list,
    preface, title, publisher etc. and visits to libraries. during
    library visits the children worked in groups with given tasks.
    through asking librarians and others they were to discover
    various means of finding books. they were also encouraged to
    find out how a library is organised, what lending conditions
    are and what training a librarian needs. the groups compared
    their results in classwork.
