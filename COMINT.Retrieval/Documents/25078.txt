further aspects of the theory of the maser problems
    relating to saturation effects and cavity resonator design for
    the device discussed previously of february are examined
    various types of noise and oscillator frequency shift are
    considered the theoretical minimum detectable beam intensity
    when the maser is used as a spectrometer for the ammonia line
    is about molecules sec under typical experimental
    conditions
