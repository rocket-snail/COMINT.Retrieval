electron emission resulting from the impact of ions on
    molybdenum and carbon targets experiments were made using
    normally incident polyatomic ions of energy between and the
    number and energy distribution of the emitted electrons did not
    depend on the target material the energy distribution of the
    electrons was independent of the nature and energy of the
    incident ions but the number of electrons emitted per ion
    increased with the energy of the ions and depended on the
    nature of the ions
