thermal and gravitational excitation of atmospheric
    oscillations previous work is extended to include a unified
    treatment for both gravitational and thermal forcing functions
    from consideration of various atmospheric models it appears
    that thermal effects are far more important than gravitational
    ones in producing the solar semi diurnal pressure variation
    this is not confirmed by observation but the disagreement may
    be eliminated by assuming the possibility of heating other than
    by ground eddy currents
