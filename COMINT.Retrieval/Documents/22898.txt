the emission of radiation from model hydrogen
    chromospheres part an improved method is presented for
    calculating the characteristics of the radiation field of and
    the lyman continuum emitted by model hydrogen atmospheres at
    kinetic temperratures of k a useful application of the results
    would be in interpreting observations of prominences and
    flares
