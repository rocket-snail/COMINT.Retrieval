german alphabetical cataloguing rules for public
    libraries and for academic libraries. at the meetings in may
    and june 81 the deutsche bibliotheksinstitut (german library
    institute) committee on alphabetical cataloguing was concerned
    with the draft version of rak-ob. large public libraries tend
    to accept this if they have not already opted for the academic
    library version but smaller public libraries stocking mainly
    german language material are critical of the draft. it was
    decided, therefore, that alternatives for small public
    libraries be included in rak-ob with reference to personal
    names, corporate bodies, unit subject headings, parallel
    headings, subordinate entries, entries for musicalia and sound
    recordings for children. rak-ob and rak-wb must not differ on
    basic principles but are to be kept physically separate.
    rak-ob's 2nd draft plan will be published soon.
