surface films and field emission of electrons the
    mechanism of cold emission of electrons from surfaces covered
    with a tarnish film under electric fields of the order of was
    investigated the results obtained are consistent with the view
    that the electrons are extracted from the metal substrate by
    the high electric field set up across the thin surface film
    when covered with a layer of positive ions
