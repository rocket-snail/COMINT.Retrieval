a queueing study of public catalog use. discusses a
    6-week queuing study of public catalogues in the iowa state
    university library system. data gathered are analysed primarily
    to determine if routinely gathered library statistics can
    validly be used to predict catalogue usage, to discover the
    ratio between the usage of the card catalogue and the senate
    catalogue, and to pinpoint the time of peak card catalogue
    usage in order to measure more closely the rate of use. this
    measurement, then, can provide 1 factor in a simulation model
    that can be constructed to predict accurately the number of
    devices needed for an alternative catalogue format.
