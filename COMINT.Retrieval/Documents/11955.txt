the ionosphere during the partial solar eclipse observed
    at buenos aires august the decrease in in the number of free
    electrons in the f layer during the eclipse was mainly due to
    ion recombinations a simultaneous decrease in the f layer was
    preceded by an appreciable increase the two layers were clearly
    separated indicating a high recombination coefficient above the
    f layer rapid decrease of the critical frequencies of both
    layers was observed during the occultation of two
    sunspots
