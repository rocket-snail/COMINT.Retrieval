public awareness in rural libraries. increasing the
    public's awareness of a library's existence and services is
    vital in any library community. in us rural areas there are
    many means of communication at the librarian's disposal,
    including the local newspaper, local radio, word-of-mouth
    communications by library staff, the county board of education,
    and service clubs. only through communication with the public
    can the rural public library increase its circulation and
    funding.
