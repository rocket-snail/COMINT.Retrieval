    importance in smaller libraries not generally open to the
    public, carried out by the german music history archive in

    in germany is not owned by the state and only found in small
    archives in castles, monasteries, churches and schools. with
    the assistance of the volkswagen foundation, the archive is
    working in north germany, microfilming these musical treasures,
    cataloguing them and then making them available to the public.

    organ music and its 18th century successors; 18th century music
    belonging to a noble family in eutin; 17th and 18th century
