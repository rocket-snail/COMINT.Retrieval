microcomputers as a modern base for automating library,
    information and bibliographical processes. the lenin state
    library has been faced with the need to create automated
    systems for coordinating stock selection, bibliographical
    information work and inter-library lending. the basic
    requirements of such systems are a capacity for selecting,
    storing, retrieving and presenting information, high
    reliability and low cost. the expense of large computers has
    retarded their use in localised situations, but the
    microcomputer can solve this problem. before choosing a
    computer, it is worthwhile considering the features of each
    type and the opinions of world experts. the lenin state library
    has found that a microcomputer can meet its requirements
    perfectly satisfactorily.
