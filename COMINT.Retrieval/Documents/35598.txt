a new aether drift experiment results of the experiment
    referred to previously of are reported a cylindrical cavity
    resonator used to control the frequency of an oscillator at
    about was mounted with its axis horizontal and was rotated in a
    horizontal plane the frequency of the oscillator was compared
    with that of a quartz standard at intervals of of the
    rotation
