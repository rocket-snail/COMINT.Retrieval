staffing reference service in university libraries' a
    cost effective model for administrative decisions. (phd
    thesis-texas woman's university.) a general cost effective
    model is developed to test staffing patterns in university
    library reference services. the model is applicable to any
    library and provides evaluative data on alternative staffing
    strategies for the reference desk. it identifies 3 important
    factors' patron's classification, frequency of arrivals, and
    types of questions asked; number of staff at desk and effect of
    their skill levels on fashion of service; and the library's
    policy concerning the importance of the reference desk service.
    the procedure for the model's implementation (to be carried out
    by the management) is based on statistical decision
    theory.
