the electronic office and the quality of working life. it
    is commonly claimed that the application of new technology to
    the office reduces routine labour and frees the employee for
    more creative work. disputes this claim by examining in detail
    the effects of automated systems on the job content and job
    satisfaction of 2 types of clerical jobs' production control
    and tele-sales. the source of the decline in the quality of
    working life in these 2 areas is located not in the technology
    itself but management aims and methods in its implementation.
    suggests possible alternative methods of work
    organisation.
