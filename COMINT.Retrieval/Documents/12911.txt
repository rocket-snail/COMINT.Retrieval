contact charging between a borosilicate glass and nickel
    contact charging of glass spheres rolling on clean ni was
    studied under conditions of controlled cleanliness humidity and
    gas pressure the effect of a transverse electric field is
    important only for high surface conductivity surface
    conductivity surface conduction limits the maximum charge which
    also varies with pressure due to gaseous discharge between the
    sphere and the metal
