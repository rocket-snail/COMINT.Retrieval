a scaling unit employing multi electrode cold cathode
    tubes a complete scaling unit for counting regular of random
    pulses id described different methods of driving cold cathode
    scaling valves are considered in the method uses the amplitudes
    and durations of the pulses applied to all stages in the slow
    scaling section are controlled by a common pulse generator the
    unit comprises a pulse amplitude discriminator of high
    sensitivity a fast scaling stage with a element valve a cascade
    arrangement of element vales type with cold cathode gating
    valves and the pulse generator some routine tests for valve
    deterioration are outlined
