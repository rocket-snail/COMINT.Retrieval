turbulence in the upper ionosphere from the experimental
    data at present available it is shown that the reynolds number
    in the upper f region level is of the order of the region may
    therefore be turbulent it is suggested that the high level
    diffracting screens which give rise to spread f r echoes and to
    radio star fading are caused by non laminar flow and that their
    non appearance during the daylight hours may be due to the
    inhibition of turbulence by large temperature gradients by
    lower drift velocities or by an increase in the kinematic
    viscosity
