the role of specialized information services in
    development. specialised information centres closely linked to
    research centres of excellence in a given field seem to be the
    most viable solution to the information explosion as far as
    developing countries are concerned. they provide much-needed
    information, can reach users rapidly, and enable their target
    scientific community to behave as a human infrastructure. the
    cassava information centre at the centro internacional de
    agricultura tropical, cali, colombia, provides consolidated
    information. information is selected, analysed for reliability
    and equality, and fused into publications such as monographs,
    state-of-the-art reviews, and directories. it also provides an
    abstracting service. emphasis is on satisfying user needs
    rather than on the techniques for doing so.
