solution to the equations of space charge flow by the
    method of the separation of variables the steady state
    behaviour of electron beams with high space charge densities is
    analysed the equations for irrotational electrostatic laminar
    space charge flow are set up in terms of the action function
    these equations are reduced by separation of variables in
    cylindrical polar coordinates the method may be extended to
    include the effect of magnetic fields
