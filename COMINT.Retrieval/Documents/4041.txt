aircraft investigation of the large ion content and
    conductivity of the atmosphere and their relation to
    meteorological factors continuation of work described
    previously of callahan et al simultaneous measurements of
    conductivity large ion concentration temperature and humidity
    over the altitude range are reported the results indicate that
    over continental areas in fair weather there exists z layer
    adjacent to the ground varying in height from to in which the
    vertical distributions of large ions and conductivity are
    controlled primarily at atmospheric turbulence at the
    upperaboundary of this layer there is a transition region about
    ft high in which the conductivity increases by a factor of
    while the large ion content decreases by a factor of above this
    region the large ion content is reduced to a very low value and
    the conductivity is determined primarily by the intensity of
    cosmic radiation and
