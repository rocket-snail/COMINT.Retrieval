a simple connection between closed loop transient
    response and open loop frequency response the phase margin
    concept of the characteristics of the nyquist diagram in the
    vicinity of the critical point is extended to give a more
    generalised formula this relates the damping of the principal
    oscillatory mode of a closed loop feedback system to the shape
    of the nyquist diagram all the quantities involved can be
    obtained from this diagram without further mathematical
    analysis or graphical construction on the diagram
