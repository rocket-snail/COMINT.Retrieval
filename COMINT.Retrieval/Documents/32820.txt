some practical determinations of the electron content
    below the level of maximum ionization in the f region of the
    ionosphere ratcliffes method of was applied to results of
    observation at slough and at singapore during and to
    simultaneous observations at penang and singapore during one
    week of july seasonal and diurnal variations of maximum
    electron density differ from those of the total number n of
    electrons in a vertical column of unit cross section in the f
    region up to the level of maximum ionization the variations of
    n show a greater dependence on the solar zenith angle diurnal
    variations of the latitude gradient of n near the magnetic
    equator are briefly discussed it apper probable that as the
    latitude alters the local noon value of n goes through a flat
    maximum in equatorial latitudes whereas the noon value of
    maximum electron density goes through a sharp minimum near the
    magnetic equator and exhibits the well known equatorial
    trough
