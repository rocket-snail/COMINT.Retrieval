integrating medical knowledge and clinical data banks'
    discovery and representation of causal relationships from a
    large time-oriented clinical database' the rx project. in the
    future computerised data bases will become ubiquitous in
    hospitals and clinics. medical data is needed not only by
    practitioners but by hospital administrators, health insurers,
    regulatory agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry. if
    appropriately analysed, the data will be a resource of
    tremendous potential value for epidemiologic research, for
    post-marketing drug surveillance, for exploratory analysis of
    costs and benefits of new tests and therapy programmes, and for
    assessment of long-term outcome in chronic diseases.
