spectrum equalization the transfer characteristics of
    nearly all forms of linear quadripoles can be equalized as
    regards both amplitude and phase by adding to the response
    function its successive time derivatives or integrals the
    method may be applied to systems for which the equivalent
    passive quadripole is not realizable eg a scanning aperture
    application of the method to servo control and television is
    discussed
