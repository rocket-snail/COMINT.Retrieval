dissemination of the published results of an important
    clinical trial' an analysis of the citing literature. presents
    the results of a citation analysis study of an important
    clinical trial which demonstrated the beneficial effects of a
    technique for treating diabetics. the study was carried out to
    determine why this technique was still not well known 18 months
    after its publication. concludes that a large number of
    citations in the literature to a clinically significant paper
    do not of itself ensure that the information reported will
    readily reach the appropriate practicing physician. stresses
    the need for more effective methods for the rapid dissemination
    of important new findings to the medical community.
