processing of patent bibliographic data at chemical
    abstracts service. chemical abstracts service (cas) has been
    involved with chemical patent information since it began in
    1907. by the early 1970s, its manual data processing system for
    patents was showing signs of strain with a million records
    already and 200,000 being added annually. to convert to a
    computerised system would require 25,000 man-hours if existing
    records were to be contained in the new system. the solution to
    this problem was found in 1977. an agreement was negotiated
    with inpadoc (the international patent documentation centre)
    for inpadoc to deliver to cas a back-file of 1.2 million patent
    records in computer-readable form and weekly tapes of current
    patent bibliographic information. describes how cas selects
    patents from the tapes and the format of the new patent index,
    derived from the inpadoc data and introduced in jan 81.
