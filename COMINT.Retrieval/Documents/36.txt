three frequency measurements of auroral absorption the
    ratio of the measured absorption of cosmic noise during auroral
    events was measured on two pairs of frequencies near assuming
    that the electron collision frequency as a function of height
    is known the height at which the absorption occurs can be
    estimated heights of were usual for intense auroral events but
    lower heights were observed for cosmic ray events
