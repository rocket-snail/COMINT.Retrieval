lf compensation for video amplifiers part negative
    feedback amplifiers the method outlined in part of august is
    applied to negative feedback amplifiers if is independent of
    frequency the overall response is optimum when the indicial
    response of the path is optimum and the order of compensation
    is the same if is made frequency dependent by including a
    capacitor in the feedback path compensation can be obtained
    which s one order higher than that obtainable from the path
    alone the method is applied to some simple circuits including
    cases where a coupling or a decoupling circuit is outside the
    feedback loop experimental results confirming the theory are
    reported
