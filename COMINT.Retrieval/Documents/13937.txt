the abnormal variations of the horizontal magnetic
    intensity t at huancayo peru the magnetic field of the
    ionospheric current system arising from lunar atmospheric tidal
    motion is calculated for various points on the earths surface
    the daily variation of the horizontal component at huancayo is
    found to be nearly twice as great as at batavia though the
    latitudes of the two points are nearly the same observations at
    a point between the geographic and magnetic equators in the
    northern hemisphere should help to explain this anomaly
