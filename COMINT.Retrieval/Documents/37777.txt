the sunrise in the ionosphere and its repercussions on
    long wave propagation the basic data are the records made at
    zurich of the variations in number and direction of arrival of
    atmospherics at a frequency of the sudden fall in number of
    received atmospherics near dawn is attributed to the sunrise at
    a height of at a point on the wave trajectory the height of the
    ozone layer is found to be km the transitory nose effect in
    recordings of atmospherics is attributed to the transition from
    d layer to e layer propagation
