the design of a practical dc amplifier based on the
    second harmonic type of magnetic modulator discussion
    description of the development of an amplifier based on the
    work of williams and noble of including details of a oscillator
    with second harmonic distortion a low pass filter to prevent
    power from the oscillator reaching the dc source a phase
    sensitive rectifier switching and overall dc negative feedback
