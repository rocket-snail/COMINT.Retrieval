response characteristics of a linear system with third
    order transfer function the rise time and delay time of a low
    pass system on application of a step function input are
    calculated using elmores formulae conditions for minimizing
    these times are determined for functions with three poles and
    two zeros the pulse transformer is treated as a numerical
    example the calculations are supported by experimental results
    as long as consideration is restricted to no overshoot
    conditions
