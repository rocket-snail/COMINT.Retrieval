private viewdata systems-a contribution to the electronic
    office. a viewdata system brings together computer,
    telecommunications and microprocessor technology to provide the
    electronic office with a cheap, user oriented information
    distribution service. a private viewdata system offers
    facilities for distribution of information of a more
    specialised nature than is available on public systems such as
    prestel, together with complete control of the system, which
    could, for example, automatically update pages of stock level
    information as orders are entered. this merges the concepts of
    viewdata with those of the conventional office computer. aims
    to highlight the use of private viewdata systems for
    information concentration and distribution.
