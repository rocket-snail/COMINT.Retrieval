a circular waveguide magic tee and its application to
    high power microwave transmission the magic t discussed
    comprises a circular section waveguide with two mutually
    perpendicular side arms of rectangular section spaced
    longitudinally at a distance this system constitutes a pair of
    h mode transformers the device can be used as a variable power
    dividing or power combining bridge and one of its main uses is
    for combining feedback power with power from the source at the
    input to a linear electron accelerator when two similar
    sections are joined via a rotatable coupling the resulting
    system is suitable for external connection via the rectangular
    side arms the power dividing ratio depends on the angle of
    rotation between the two sections other applications include
    use with a circular polarizer to act as a phase shifter or
    variable impedance
