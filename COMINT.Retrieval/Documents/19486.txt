a photoelectric analogue computer for investigating the
    dynamic behaviour of linear systems apparatus is described for
    determining the output function of a linear system such as an
    amplifier or servomechanism when the input and transfer
    functions are known the two known functions are represented by
    appropriately shaped apertures in diaphragms interposed between
    light source and photocell the mechanical system used to
    produce the required continuous variation of the input function
    is described in detail
