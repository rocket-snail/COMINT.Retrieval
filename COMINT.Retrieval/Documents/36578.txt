excessive ionization in the lower ionosphere and
    instabilities in the outer radiation belt absorption anomalies
    in the lower ionosphere are interpreted on the basis of recent
    observations of aurorae and the van allen belts the analysis of
    long term measurements indicates a strong dependence of the
    ionization effects on sunspot activity
