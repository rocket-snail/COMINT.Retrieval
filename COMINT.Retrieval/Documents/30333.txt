normalization of titles and their retrieval. the title
    expressed by a noun phrase or clause is converted to a
    function-expression by parsing. for retrieval with a reasonable
    recall rate as well as a high precision rate, the
    function-expression is transformed to a predicate-governor form
    and then normalised to a standard form. various items are taken
    from this and recorded in a hierarchical, tree-like inverted
    file. to keep recall at a reasonable rate, several retrieval
    stages are implemented based on the key-term and case-label
    matching. retrieval is controlled by the preciseness of the
    specification of case-labels for each key-term.
