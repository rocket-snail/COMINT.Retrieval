mathematical experimentation in time-lag modulation
    equations of the form du/dt = g(u(t),u(h(t))) arise in a number
    of scientific contexts. the authors point out some interesting
    properties of the solution u'(t) = -u(t-1-k*sin(wt))+sin(at).
    these properties were obtained by means of numerical solution.
