electron energy distributions in plasmas part report of a
    method of carrying out a druyvesteyn analysis electronically
    the results show very wide deviations from the maxwellian
    distribution in striated discharges and suggest that a high
    anomalous rate of energy exchange between the electrons of a
    low pressure discharge is a much rarer phenomenon than might be
    supposed
