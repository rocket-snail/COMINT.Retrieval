thermophysical and electronic properties information
    analysis center (tepiac). a continuing systematic program on
    data tables of thermophysical and electronic properties of
    materials. tepiac's activities reported include literature
    search, acquisition, and input of source information;
    documentation review and codification; material classification;
    information organisation; operation of a computerised
    bibliographic information storage and retrieval system; data
    extraction and compilation; data evaluation, correlation,
    analysis, synthesis, and generation of recommended values;
    preparation and publication of handbooks, data books. for an
    earlier report 2see1 80/3865. tepiac covers 14 thermophysical
    properties and 22 electronic, electrical, magnetic, and optical
    properties of nearly all materials at all temperatures and
    pressures and in all environments.
