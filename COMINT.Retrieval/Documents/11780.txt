two notable experiments in children's libraries: clamart,
    france and sao paulo, brazil. following a visit to the clamart
    'joy through books' project in 1979, the librarian in charge of
    the sao paulo children's library network comments on the
    similarities between the 2 schemes, both designed to provide
    for their respective users places where children can learn
    about the world and become aware of the value of books. details
    are given of the organisation and operation of the 2 schemes,
    where conventional library practices have been replaced by more
    innovative approaches.
