perturbations of filtered oscillators the amplifier of an
    oscillator is assumed to be filtered to isolate the fundamental
    frequency so that the oscillator responds to excitation by a
    synchronous sinusoidal oscillation an equation for the
    oscillator perturbations is developed which involves the
    partial derivatives of the gain and phase from this equation th
    existence of a synchronization threshold can be demonstrated
    for the general case when the perturbation is below this
    threshold frequency pulling occurs
