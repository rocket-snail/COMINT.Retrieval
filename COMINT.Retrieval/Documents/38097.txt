enhancement of ionization in the e layer due to solar
    flares during the international geophysical year the value of
    observed at slough at the hour preceding the commencement of
    each clare of importance and and at the two succeeding hours
    have been examined in relation to normal values results show
    that during the interval min after the commencement of a flare
    there is a mean increase in the intensity of e layer ionizing
    radiation which is at least for class flares and for class
    flares
