calculation of the harmonic distortion in sinusoidal
    modulation of frequency or phase detailed study of a quadripole
    with antiresonant circuit the fm voltage applied to the input
    terminals of an arbitrary quadripole is expressed by a
    convergent fourier series an expression is deduced for the
    tangent of the variable phase shift introduced by the
    quadripole in the form of the quotient of two rapidly
    convergent series of bessel functions which lend themselves
    well to numerical calculation three parameters are involved the
    wave length the modulation index m and the ratio of to the qu
    factor of the parallel rlc circuit considered numerical
    calculations are made for eight cases of practical interest
    involving different values of m and the results given by the
    complete formulae for the harmonic distortion are compared with
    those obtained by application of the instantaneous frequency
    rule
