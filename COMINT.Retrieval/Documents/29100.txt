the true facts about censorship?. reply to an article by
    e.j. groeskamp in bibliotheek en samenleving 9 (12) dec 81,
    333-337 (for an abstract of which 2see1 82/4167), in which
    attention was drawn to the hidden censorship practised by
    public libraries. groeskamp's definition of censorship should
    more properly be termed 'rejection on ethical grounds'. because
    of lack of space and financial resources, libraries cannot
    purchase all books published and selection is necessary to
    obtain a balanced collection of material. the facts on which
    groeskamp's arguments are based include 2 library surveys, of
    which 1 contained insufficient data to draw any firm
    conclusions, while the other produced results in conflict with
    groeskamp's deductions. for financial reasons it is to be
    expected that in a community of 1 religious persuasion few
    books of a different persuasion are likely to be found in the
    local public library.
