spinor theory of four terminal networks a spinor can be
    described as a geometrical object in dimensional space having a
    magnitude and three eulerian angles in the application of
    spinor theory to terminal networks the four spinor components
    represent the complex current and complex c voltage the
    associated vector represents power and the direction ratio
    represents impedance applications of the spinor theory are
    shown but the study is restricted to steady state conditions
    negative resistance is not excluded from the
    considerations
