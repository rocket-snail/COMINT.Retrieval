radiation from molecules in the presence of a strong high
    frequency field it is shown that in addition to an absorption
    of the energy at a frequency where are energy levels of the
    molecule emission takes place at a frequency which is a
    function of the matrix element of the dipole moment
    corresponding to the transition and the field strength of the
    field in a typical case and the field strength is the value of
    is then approximately the radiation is only present if the
    elements and are not equal to zero
