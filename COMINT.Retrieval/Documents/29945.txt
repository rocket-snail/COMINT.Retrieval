collision processes in meteor trails momentum loss cross
    sections for impacts between meteor atoms and atmospheric
    molecules are calculated the values of the ionization cross
    section derived from them are in agreement with those derived
    earlier by bates and massey the diffusion of ionization in a
    meteor trail is also discussed in relation to known mobilities
    of positive ions in gases
