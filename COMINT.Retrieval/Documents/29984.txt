experimental investigations on multivibrators and
    amplifier circuits with secondary electron emission valves as
    described by kroebel multivibrators of the type described by
    kroebel of february were investigated pulse flank slopes of the
    order of up to pulse amplitudes of were obtained the
    multivibrator can be modified to act as a pulse amplifier
    without feedback
