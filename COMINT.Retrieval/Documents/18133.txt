the finnish periodicals index is undergoing changes. the
    printed version of the finnish periodicals index covers
    1957-77. in addition there is a retrospective index for
    1803-63. the current index is now processed by a computer. the
    index is selective both in its coverage of periodicals and
    periodical articles. udc has been used since computerisation.
    because of computerisation the presentation has suffered. there
    are plans to decentralise the indexing, which until now has
    been carried out by the library of turku university, and to
    expand the coverage.
