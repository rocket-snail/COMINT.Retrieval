a mode of oscillation of conventional triode valves
    analysis shows that if certain conditions are satisfied uhf
    oscillations are possible in a triode valve designed for lower
    frequencies this was verified for a telefunken type triode
    which is designed to oscillate on wavelengths down to about cm
    the valve has two grid and two anode terminals and to these a
    resonant wire system was attached with a resistor and
    milliammeter connected between grid and earth with an anode
    voltage of good oscillations on a wavelength of cm were
    obtained the mean oscillatory voltage on the grid being about
    and on the anode about the calculated wavelength was about
    cm
