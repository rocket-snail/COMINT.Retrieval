the frequency modulation of tuned circuit and relaxation
    oscillators the problem of distortionless frequency modulation
    of oscillators for any modulating frequency is considered the
    conditions for an ideal nonlinear frequency modulator are
    formulated and aoolied to the constant amplitude and relaxation
    oscillator
