unifying design principle for the resistance network
    analogue a cell principle technique due to macneal is extended
    and generalized as an illustration poissons equation is
    integrated over the volume of a representative small cell in
    which form it is easier to appreciate the analogy with the
    resistance network and to arrive at the relevant design
    parameters
