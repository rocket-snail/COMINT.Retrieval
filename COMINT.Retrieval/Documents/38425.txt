the influence of magnetic impulses on the kinetic energy
    of electrons analysis is presented showing that magnetic
    impulses such as those caused by em waves with discontinuities
    in the magnetic components may produce variation of the kinetic
    energy of electrons z and may contribute to the destruction of
    atomic structures
