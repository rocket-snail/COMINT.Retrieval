secondary electron emission from metals under the action
    of ions and neutral particles experimental results obtained by
    bombardment of clean metals with ions of and neutral atoms of
    the inert gases show that the coefficient of secondary emission
    increases linearly at particle velocities up to for proton
    bombardment a ma imum occurs at a velocity of
