magnetic resonance for arbitrary field strengths
    discussion is presented for a paramagnetic gas assuming that
    strong collisions are the only important factor apart from the
    applied magnetic field and that the latter comprises a
    circularly polarized component in the plane perpendicular to
    the constant components
