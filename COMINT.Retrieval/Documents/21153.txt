issue control on a wrong track. a critical review by
    vejle library's automation committee of the national
    association of local authorities' report on 2automated issue
    control, 1one of the proposals for standard specifications
    issued by the biblioteksdata partners. the review points to
    problems of use of the register of personal code numbers. the
    system whereby check-out uses personal numbers, while the
    return process uses book numbers, causes problems for the
    reader of identifying which books are due back when. discusses
    how the system deals with renewals, fines, and recalls. use of
    book numbers only for reservations amounts to a deterioration
    of service, and the method whereby interlibrary loans are
    included is unclear. issue control over material which cannot
    be given a book number (e.g. picture books, jigsaws) is
    effectively abandoned. in all, the lack of information about
    each loan causes major problems; it should be possible to use
    the information in the bibliographic base also in the issue
    control registers.
