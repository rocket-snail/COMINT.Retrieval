plasma theory of the ionosphere the basic equations for
    the dynamic and electrical behaviour of the ionosphere are
    derived from the theory of a theory of a neutral plasma and are
    used to investigate the problems of diffusion of the plasma at
    layer boundaries em damping of air movements and tidal
    oscillations of the ionosphere
