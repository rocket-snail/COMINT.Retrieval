on short periodic variations in solar noise storms on
    days of enhanced solar radiation on in june july and august are
    investigated by an autocorrelation method in a search for short
    periodic variations with repetition times between and min
    results indicate that some noise storms are characterized by
    periodic variations with repetition times differing from day to
    day while other noise storms exhibit no periodic variations it
    is possible that a specific noise storm area retains its
    characteristics of short periodic variations in radio emission
    for a solar rotation or longer
