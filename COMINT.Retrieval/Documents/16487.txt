theory of nonreciprocal circuits with equal input and
    output frequency using nonlinear semiconductor elements the
    quadripole equations and transfer gain are derived for
    nonreciprocal amplifiers which consist of tunnel diode or
    parametric diode converter stages in cascade connection see
    also of january matching and decoupling problems are considered
    for various circuit configurations
