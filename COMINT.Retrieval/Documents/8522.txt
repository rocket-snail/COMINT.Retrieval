theory of total reflection the theory of total reflection
    of an elliptically polarized plane wave is developed from
    expressions for the energy density and the poynting vector
    using the notation of the earlier paper results indicate that
    at total reflection the mean flow of energy in the refracted
    wave contains a com ponent normal to the plane o incidence this
    component is zero in non total reflection and in two special
    cases its magnitude is proportional to the wavelength in the
    first medium
