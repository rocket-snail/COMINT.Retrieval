production of millimetre waves by a magnetic undulator
    measurements hav made on a device of a type described
    previously and using an electron beam from a pulsed linear
    accelerator with a meaam intensity of the output power was
    about intermediate between the values corresponding to complete
    incoherence and complete coherence of the elementary vibrations
    the spectrum extended from with a maximum at
