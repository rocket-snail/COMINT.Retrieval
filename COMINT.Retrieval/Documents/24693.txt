an assessment of micrographics in advanced office
    information technologies. an assessment of micrographics and
    its relationship to several information technologies is
    presented. the findings of a technological assessment for
    1980-1985 are listed. a system for analysing typical office
    functions is explained and a range of micrographics
    applications in the office environment is described including
    computer-aided retrieval and word processing outputting to com.
    problems in the development of the advanced technology office
    are discussed. the use of video/optical disc technology for
    information storage and retrieval functions is examined. the
    use of microimages as opto-electronic memories is also
    evaluated.
