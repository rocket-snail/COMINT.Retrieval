theory of a conductor near the boundary of two media the
    electromagnetic field due to an oscillation of angular
    frequency in the conductor can usually be split into two
    components a cylindrical wave field and a spherical wave field
    near the axis of the conductor which is parallel to the
    boundary plane the field is of a special type the condition for
    the existence of the two components is derived and applied to
    particular cases
