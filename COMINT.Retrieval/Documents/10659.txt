cairs-a computer assisted information retrieval system. a
    flexible low cost minicomputer based information retrieval
    system is described. cairs (computer assisted information
    retrieval system) allows information in the form of documents,
    text, records or abstracts to be stored in a computer data
    base. the programs have been written in rtl2, a high level
    transportable computer language, which allows cairs to run on
    most popular minicomputers. data entry is carried out using a
    direct key to disc facility, with formatted visual display
    screens being presented to speed input. the advantages of input
    validation and efficient editing of entered material are fully
    exploited, and an interactive thesaurus may also be used. data
    on cairs can be indexed using classification systems or
    hierarchical structures. alternatively, keyword indexing of the
    automatic, semi-automatic or manual type may be applied, plus
    either a free or controlled language vocabulary. searching
    proceeds via inverted file and ser ial (string) search
    functions, although a variety of specialised tasks allow
    bulletins, lists and catalogues to be produced. cairs is
    designed to replace any applications where manual card index
    filing systems are employed, and is available as both a
    software system or as a complete software/hardware
    package.
