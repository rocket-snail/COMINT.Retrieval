method of solving a class of axially symmetric problems
    in the theory of potential and application to the design of
    electron optical lenses a class of problems arising in the
    calculation of es fields with rotational symmetry is considered
    if the systems satisfy certain conditions they can be treated
    by a method of successive approximations which are obtained by
    solving a plane es problem
