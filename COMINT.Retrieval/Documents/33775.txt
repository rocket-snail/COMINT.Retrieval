bibliographic data bases in collection development.
    reviews the literature on the use of batch and on-line
    bibliographic data bases in collection development activities.
    presents the methods and results of a survey of us special
    libraries and medium sized research libraries designed to
    ascertain the extent of the use of on-line data bases in
    selection and collection evaluation. concludes that on-line
    data bases are being primarily used for bibliographic
    verification as part of the selection process, and that very
    little use in collection evaluation was reported, although its
    potential was acknowledged. describes a recent evaluation of
    chemistry holdings in the library of the state university of
    new york at albany.
