centralised book distribution-a topic of the day. a
    strong plea for establishing a new, centralised enterprise to
    supply libraries, especially public libraries, with literature
    and up-to-date equipment. enterprise of that kind had been
    envisaged already in the statute for the national network of
    libraries in bulgaria. similar organisations have been in
    operation in other socialist countries. they are of invaluable
    assistance to librarians, in particular those in small
    libraries, who very often lack the necessary qualifications in
    librarianship and work only part-time. books are selected,
    purchased and distributed to libraries almost immediately after
    they have been published, the catalogue cards with appropriate
    annotations being delivered at the same time. thus, new
    acquisitions are selected expertly to maintain the proper ratio
    between political, fictional and special material. librarians
    are by these means relieved of the tedious and time-consuming
    task of cataloguing, and can devote more time to their readers,
    to their ideological education and to professional
    advancement.
