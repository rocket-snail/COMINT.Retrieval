determination of the lifetime of an artificial earth
    satellite and study of the secular perturbations of its orbit a
    general mathematical method is described which is valid for any
    satellite and which takes account of the distribution of
    atmospheric density with altitude this method is based on
    single parameter series of integral curves of a first order
    equation from graphs and tables the satellite lifetime and the
    variation of the orbital parameters with time are rapidly
    calculated the effect of atmospheric rotation on the secular
    variations of the satellites orbit are found to be small
