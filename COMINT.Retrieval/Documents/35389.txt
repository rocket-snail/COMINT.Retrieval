tensor analysis of transistor feedback circuits theory is
    presented for the grounded base circuit the coefficients of the
    impedance matrix for the back coupled circuit are obtained by
    multiplying those for the original circuit by certain
    characteristic tensors derived from the relation between the
    currents in the original and in the back coupled arrangements
    particular conditions examined include current feedback
    positive and negative voltage feedback and other arrangements
    involving two feedback paths applicability of the duality
    principle is discussed
