energy spectrum of atmospherics and attenuation of
    different low frequencies with distance supplement energy
    spectrum curves of atmospherics produced at known distances are
    derived from simultaneous measurements on four frequencies in
    the range of curves of attenuation for the range are similar to
    the theoretical curves of budden
