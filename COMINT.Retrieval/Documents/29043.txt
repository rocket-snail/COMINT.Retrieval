on the nature of the transcendental curves associated
    with the relativistic trajectories of charged particles
    analysis applicable to particles with moderate relativistic
    velocities at which radiation loss is negligible the equations
    of the e trajectory are formulated for the general case of
    particles injected with arbitrary velocity into crossed
    electric and magnetic fields the case of zero injection
    velocity is calculated explicitly see also below
