inadequacy of ring current theory for the main phase of a
    geomagnetic storm there appears to be insufficient dissipation
    to allow significant diffusion during a magnetic storm of the
    magnetic fields in the vicinity of the earth a ring current
    field can therefore only increase the horizontal component of
    the geomagnetic field and cannot account for the main phase of
    a geomagnetic storm
