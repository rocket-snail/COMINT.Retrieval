theory of langmuir probes a note contrasting results of
    langmuirs theory with those of the authors precise theory of
    the spherical probe at low pressures and negative probe
    potential electric microdischarges in a dynamic vacuum account
    of an experimental a theoretical investigation of undesired
    discharges occurring as a result of surface imperfections in
    vacuum apparatus operated at high voltage experimental
    electrode systems similar to those in electron microscopes were
    used the phenomena are distinguishable from field emission and
    involve repeated secondary emission of electrons and h ions for
    voltages applied in very short pulses the upper limit before
    onset of microdischarges is higher than for continuous
    voltages
