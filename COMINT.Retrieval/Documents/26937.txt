lip service' the undergraduate library instruction
    program at the ohio state university. in the 1st phase of a
    comprehensive library user education programme at ohio state
    university, all incoming students are oriented to the use of 1
    or 2 undergraduate libraries, listen to a lecture on the use of
    basic library tools, and then are expected to complete an
    exercise in finding information on their own within the
    library. the ohio state university experience has shown that a
    successful programme, which reaches 8,600 students in a typical
    fall term, is possible using existing staff.
