multichannel crystal control of vhf and uhf oscillators
    the frequencies of a number of channels are controlled by a
    single crystal using an oscillator whose phase is varied
    periodically by application of pulses the oscillator output
    comprises a spectrum of harmonically related frequencies whose
    fundamental is the crystal controlled pulse frequency a
    particular triode oscillator covers the range with fundamental
    in the range by appropriately tuning the tank circuit any
    desired harmonic can be emphasized by an amount up to
