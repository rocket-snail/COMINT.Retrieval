computer simulation of physical-chemical properties of
    organic molecules. 1. molecular system identification. a
    computer program which generates molecular geometries and
    performs molecular calculations for organic molecules is
    presented. a linear coding methodology used for inputting the
    molecules is also described. this is the foundation of a
    program aimed at the simulation of the physical-chemical
    properties of organic molecules.
