transistor theory and transistor circuits simple theory o
    for transistors is developed from that for thermionic valves on
    the basis of the duality principle and by comparison with the
    aperiodic retarding field valve semidynamic rather than static
    characteristics are obtained by biasing the collector by means
    of a resistor these characteristics can be converted to the
    usual static ones by a coordinate transformation parameters are
    measured by means of a transistor bridge equivalent to that
    used for obtaining the dyn mic characteristics of a thermionic
    valve the parameters found are related to the constant current
    values of the parameters hitherto used simple formulae are
    derived for the voltage and power amplification of grounded
    base and grounded emitter circuits use of the negative static
    resistance o a grounded emitter transistor for measuring the
    resonance resistance of oscillatory circuits is
    discussed
