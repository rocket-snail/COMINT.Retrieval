the fields of a line source of current over a stratified
    conductor expressions for the electric and the magnetic fields
    are derived assuming the to be infinitely long and parallel to
    the conductor at large distances the results can be generalized
    to apply to any source of horizontally polarized waves situated
    on the surface of a half space consisting of an arbitrary
    number of layers
