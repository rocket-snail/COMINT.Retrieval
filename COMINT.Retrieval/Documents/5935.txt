public libraries and the child user. argues that, despite
    the increasing evidence of a more flexible attitude on the part
    of libraries to the use of their facilities by children during
    the past 2 decades, there is still a perception on the part of
    some children and their parents that libraries are somehow
    inimical to their way of life. highlights the need for library
    services to develop in ways appropriate to the meeting of the
    needs of the 20th century child, and considers the significance
    of the international year of the child for public library
    services for children.
