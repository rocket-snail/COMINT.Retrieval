microwave measurements on a high frequency excited gas
    discharge waves were transmitted through the discharge vessel
    and amplitude and phase changes were measured as a function of
    the anode voltage of the plasma producing hf generator horn
    radiators were applied to the ends or sides of the vessel and
    the direction of polarization was varied
