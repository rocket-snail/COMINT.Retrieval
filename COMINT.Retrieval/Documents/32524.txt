interplanetary magnetic field and its control of cosmic
    ray variations a model interplanetary magnetic field is
    described which may explain some features of solar cosmic ray
    increases and also fluctuations in the primary radiation an
    attempt is made to show how localized solar fields may create
    the field which should be largely radial in form
