an indian librarian looks at the progress of american
    libraries in 1960s and 1970s. the period in question saw a
    rapid growth in us academic libraries which reached a peak
    around 1974. localised library automation was abandoned in
    favour of cooperative networks and at the same time there was
    the rise of the phenomenon of on-line data base reference
    services such as dialog. considerable attention was given to
    the development of multi-media learning resources centres.
    library administration became less hierarchical in the early
    1970s with more trade union involvement in evidence. the
    worsening economic situation after 1974 left its mark with the
    drying up of library vacancies and noticeable pressure on
    library resources.
