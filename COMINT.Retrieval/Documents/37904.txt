electromagnetic waves in a plasma located in a magnetic
    field mathematical analysis for the case of a cylindrical
    plasma rod located in an uniform external field and isolated
    from the metallic walls of a waveguide a dispersion equation is
    derived and the e m field configuration is determined it is
    shown that e m waves can be propagated in the system at
    frequencies significantly lower than the langmuir and larmor
    frequencies
