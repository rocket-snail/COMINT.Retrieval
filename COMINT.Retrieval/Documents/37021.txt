the trapping of cosmic radio waves beneath the ionosphere
    when there is a horizontal gradient in the critical frequency
    of a layer incoming extraterrestrial radiation may be trapped
    between the layer and the ground and propagated over large
    distances this would account for the reception of cosmic noise
    at frequencies lower than the local critical frequency
