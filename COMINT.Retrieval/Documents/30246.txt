user studies' a review of ideas. brazilian library school
    course work prepared in 1979, based on a review of the
    literature. recent studies have tended to adopt a sociological
    approach' the most commonly used survey techniques are
    outlined, and their limitations criticised. significant results
    of studies of users of scientific and technical information are
    summarised, to establish a basis for discussing how users
    interact with information systems. the chief factors
    determining user behaviour are isolated, and the need for
    further research emphasised. considers the situation in brazil
    with specific reference to public libraries, an area hitherto
    virtually unresearched. the importance of knowing more about
    potential users here is of primary importance.
