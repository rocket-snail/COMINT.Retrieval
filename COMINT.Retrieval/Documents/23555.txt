subharmonic oscillations in nonlinear systems the order
    of the subharmonics in systems with nonlinear restoring force
    is closely related to the form of the nonlinearity a detailed
    analysis is presented for the subharmonic oscillation of order
    for the cases in which the nonlinearity is expressed by a cubic
    or a quintic function stability is discussed by means of the
    criterion previously given o august
