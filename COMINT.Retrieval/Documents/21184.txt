tolerance coefficients for rc networks a method is
    presented for determining the effect on network design
    characteristics of the use of nonideal components a set of
    tolerance e coefficients is derived relating percentage changes
    of the positions of the poles and zeros of the network function
    to percentage changes of the network components changes of gain
    or phase are then easily calculated an exact solution is
    obtainable only when the network contains at most three
    independent capacitors two theorems are proved which serve to
    check approximations made for more complex networks
