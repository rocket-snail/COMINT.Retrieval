traditional measures of public libraries' an empirical
    analysis. investigates the inter-relationships and possible
    meanings of the traditional measures of public libraries in
    order to (1) understand the inter-relationships between the
    individual measures that have been traditionally maintained by
    libraries, identifying those that are redundant and those that
    are unique; (2) determine the effects of each of these measures
    on all other measures; and (3) understand the validity of these
    measures, singly or in combination with others, as indicators
    of library effectiveness. the data used is that collected in
    the 1974 us public libraries survey, which asked for data on 60
    measures.
