patent information system' a procedure adopted by iip.
    describes the use of coordinate indexing at the indian
    institute of petroleum (iip) to retrieve indian patents on
    specific subjects, the patent numbers being unknown. the
    institute indexes the patents using the api (american petroleum
    institute) thesaurus, the iip thesaurus, and the indian patent
    office classification number. the resultant in-depth coverage
    of the patents bridges the inter-discipline gap more
    satisfactorily than classification alone.
