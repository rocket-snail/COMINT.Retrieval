on the swf phenomenon dellinger effect and in the world
    wide distribution assuming a chapman distribution of ionization
    for the d region it is shown that is a function of solar zenith
    angle and magnetic latitude while the increase of during a
    sudden ionospheric disturbance depends on solar zenith angle
    only observational results are analysed and the effective
    factor by which solar radiation is increased during a sid is
    estimated
