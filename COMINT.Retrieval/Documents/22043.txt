on the integration of data-, text- and facsimile
    communication in libraries. the development of new techniques
    in the field of communication and storage is a challenge for
    libraries. in some fields these techniques are already in use;
    joint cataloguing with on-line connection to a data bank,
    information transfer by access to data bases, use of
    audio-visual media for orientation and user training. other
    uses include viewdata, telecopier, text processing machines and
    the storage of mass pictures and texts on video discs instead
    of microfilm.
