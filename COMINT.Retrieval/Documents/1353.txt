behaviour of a two level solid state maser it is shown
    under simplifying assumptions that when a system of spins is in
    resonance with the cavity and when damping effects caused by
    relaxation phenomena and cavity losses are not excessive
    modulation of the cavity power output is exactly what is to be
    expected on the basis of a dynamical analysis see also
