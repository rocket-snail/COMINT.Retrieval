stimulated emission into optical whispering modes of
    spheres stimulated emission into optical whispering modes of a
    spherical sample of has been observed light produced by the
    stimulated emission is radiated tangentially from each point on
    the surface of the sphere the experimental results have been
    interpreted in terms of the electromagnetic analogue of the
    rayleigh theory of the whispering gallery
