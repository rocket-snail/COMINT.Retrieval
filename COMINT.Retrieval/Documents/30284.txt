information science and information design' have they
    anything to communicate to one another?. examines the concept
    of 'information' as the term in 'information design' still
    largely taken for granted and proposes an approach from
    information science which can offer a useful theoretical
    foundation for information design too. it also looks at some of
    the ways of thinking about information which are employed by
    practitioners in information work, those who deal with texts
    from the point of view of information retrieval and who act as
    intermediaries between generators and users of information. the
    professional practice of this group of intermediaries in
    information communication has, it is argued, some useful
    insights for that of the other group-information
    designers.
