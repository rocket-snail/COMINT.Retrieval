on costing alternative patterns for com-fiche catalogues.
    an algebraic model relating catalogue costs to the number of
    existing titles, new titles and titles processed is developed.
    the number of titles processed is then related to the
    cumulation and consolidation frequencies so that the effect of
    different cumulation patterns can be calculated. this shows
    that annual consolidation is sensible in several situations.
    variations in other factors are not considered explicitly but a
    computer simulation model is described which could be used to
    investigate any set of reasonable alternatives.
