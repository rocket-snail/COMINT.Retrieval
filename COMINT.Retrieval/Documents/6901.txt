identification of extended radio source near gemini with
    residual nebula of nova flare up of the source reported by is
    identified it is predicted that on the each year the centres of
    the sun and this source will be only apart and hence an eclipse
    will occur this source which subtends an angle about equal to
    that of the sun affords the possibility of transillumination
    type observations f the solar corona a similar source in the
    crab nebula does not approach so closely to the sun but is
    smaller and has a higher radio flux
