school library-public library. report of a lecture given
    to the annual meeting of denmark's school library association,
    1981 by peter seeberg. the historical background of school and
    public libraries in denmark is reviewed and doubts are cast on
    the genuineness of official danish liberalism in relation to
    the development of and attitude to libraries. schools and
    libraries originated from 2 entirely different concepts' in
    schools children had others to think for them; libraries in
    denmark arose from the late 19th century idea of culture for
    all and access for all to everything there was to know. by the
    1930s libraries had become instigators of culture, with
    lectures as well as books available, and were regarded as
    progressive in all its meanings. this is still the aim of
    libraries today, but schools and libraries have always belonged
    together and integration of the 2 is perfectly
    reasonable.
