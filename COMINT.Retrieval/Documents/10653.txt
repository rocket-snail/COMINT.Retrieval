high frequency crystal filter design techniques and
    applications commercially available hf crystal filters exhibit
    performance characteristics previously attainable only at lower
    frequencies filters normally consist of from two to eight
    quartz resonators in a lattice or bridge network and are
    characterized by high q and stability under extreme
    environmental conditions normal values of q for filter
    components in the range are from to in certain filters element
    qs exceed by eliminating the need for multiple frequency
    conversions the small rugged filters are useful in many am ssb
    and fm receivers as well as single sideband generators
