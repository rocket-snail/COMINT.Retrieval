magnetic effects in the f region of the ionosphere night
    time values of f at stations in the south of africa are found
    to decrease with increasing values of the equivalent planetary
    daily amplitude the magnetic control of night time ionization
    could account for the day to day correlation of values the
    relation of ionospheric and magnetically quiet days is
    discussed
