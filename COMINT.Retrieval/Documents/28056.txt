on pre exponential factors in formulae for ionic
    conductivity in solids it if in formulae for equilibrium
    constants and rate constants ener y is assumed to be
    proportional to temperature the factor preceding the
    exponential term is not increased by a factor exp being a
    constant and boltmanns constant but by a factor involving
    entropy
