the ignition mechanism of an electric gas discharge in a
    transverse magnetic field at pressures of torr continuation of
    work noted in of january a nonuniform field is obtained by
    making the radius of the outer cylinder much greater than that
    of the inner the ignition characteristic ignition voltage
    magnetic induction electrode separation obtained by calculation
    is compared with measurements in ar the agreement is good the
    ionization coefficient is independent of pressure and the
    electron replacement coefficient is proportional to pressure
    with high voltages and low magnetic fields the electrons are
    produced mainly by ionic bombardment of the outer cylinder and
    by ion collisions in the gas with low voltages and high
    magnetic fields the electrons are produced mainly by ionic
    bombardment of the end surfaces a formula relating the electron
    replacement coefficient to the ratio between the mean free path
    and the parameter of the cycloidal electron trajectory gives
    results in good agreement with those derived from the observed
    ignition characteristics
