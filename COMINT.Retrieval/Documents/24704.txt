recommended list information supply in public libraries-a
    contribution to the development of information work. at a
    colloquium of the library association of east germany which
    took place on 27-28 oct 76 in eisenhuttenstadt one of the
    themes was the efficiency of information work in public
    libraries and recommendations for future aims in this field.
    public libraries should use the recommended list of reference
    books and information literature published by the central
    institute of librarianship as a basis to improve their
    information activity. this list includes all general reference
    literature such as encyclopaedias, dictionaries, statutes, and
    the works of marx, engels and lenin. it is also important to
    keep the collection of information material up to date with
    current parliamentary reports, conference reports, and
    territorial literature such as town guides and other maps.
    trade union literature should also be available in public
    libraries. librarians should improve information activi ties to
    meet the raised level of user demand in this field.
