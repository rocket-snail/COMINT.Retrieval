nalnet book system' cost benefit study. the goals of the
    nasa's library network system, nalnet, the functions of the
    current book system, the products and services of a book system
    required by nasa centre libraries, and the characteristics of a
    system that would best supply those products and services were
    assessed. emphasis was placed on determining the most cost
    effective means of meeting nasa's requirements for an automated
    book system. various operating modes were examined including
    the current stims file, the pubfile, developing software
    improvements for products as appropriate to the centre needs,
    and obtaining cataloguing and products from the bibliographic
    utilities including at least oclc, rlin, bna, and stif. it is
    recommended that nalnet operate under the stims file mode and
    obtain cataloguing and products from the bibliographic
    utilities.
