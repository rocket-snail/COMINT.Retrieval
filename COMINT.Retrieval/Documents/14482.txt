a linear capacitance change circuit capacitance changes
    produced by mechanical displacement modulate the frequency of a
    franklin oscillator which drives a nonode fm discriminator
    sensitivity is and the output is linear between and about
    references are given to measurements of mechanical and other
    quantities by means of a capacitance change
