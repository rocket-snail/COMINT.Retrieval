silicon solar energy converters theory of operation of
    the si junction photodiode is given and compared with
    experimental data si is shown to be the most efficient
    semiconductor available for conversion of solar energy a design
    is discussed in which the radiation is incident on the n layer
    the thickness of the p layer is required to be low to give low
    resistance but not so low that minority carriers recombine
    before diffusing to the junction resistance at the metal
    contacts must be kept as low as possible conversion efficiences
    of have been attained possibilities are indicated of improving
    the efficiency by use of nonreflecting coatings or auxiliary
    mirrors and lenses
