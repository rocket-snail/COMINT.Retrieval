a theoretical model of electron density distribution
    along a geomagnetic line of force in the exosphere a model of
    electron density in the exosphere is set up by supposing
    electrons to diffuse along tubes of force electron densities in
    ionosphere and exosphere are related by steady state solutions
    the particle source is in the ionosphere under normal
    conditions but during a magnetic storm particles are injected
    into a tube of force at its furthest point from earth the role
    of collisions is discussed
