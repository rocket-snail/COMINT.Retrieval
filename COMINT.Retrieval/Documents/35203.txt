the complex formulation of the equations for two
    dimensional space charge flow the equations satisfied by an
    electron for congruent space charge flow are solved using a
    complex variable formulation for a constant magnetic field
    normal to the flow solutions are also obtained in the presence
    of magnetic fields and for flow along the level lines of a
    harmonic function
