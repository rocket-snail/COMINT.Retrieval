patent coverage by abstracting services. 4. coverage of
    microbiological patents. reports a study on the coverage by 7
    major abstracting services in the field of microbiology in
    regard to patents. only 3 of the services-2chemical abstracts,
    microbiology abstracts, section +a, 1and 2food science and
    technology abstracts1-cover patents at all. the 3 services were
    assessed in terms of the information they provide about patents
    and in terms of their performance in retrieving patents taken
    from a master list of patents on genetic engineering and
    vitamin d, obtained by searches on 2world patents index.
    1timeliness of the services was also assessed. it was found
    that none of the standard abstracting services in the field
    cover patents satisfactorily and they are slow in picking up
    patents. the research demonstrates that by scanning just
    japanese, u.s.s.r. u.s., and u.k. patents, both timely and
    comprehensive coverage of the microbiological patent literature
    can be obtained.
