exact solution of a time varying capacitance problem a
    new method is developed giving a closed form solution for the
    harmonics generated by a sinusoidally varying capacitance in
    series with a fixed resistor and battery practical applications
    are discussed with reference to the condenser microphone and
    vibrating reed electrometer and a special loudspeaker
