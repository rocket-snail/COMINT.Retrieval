pre breakdown phenomena in uniform fields observations
    were made of pre breakdown phenomena in uniform field gaps
    under ambient atmospheric conditions and measured irradiation
    intensities in which current and light pulses were recorded
    from measurements of the current pulse duration a value for the
    mobility of positive ions was obtained at field strengths
    approaching the breakdown value
