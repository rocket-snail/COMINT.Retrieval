low cost variable phase shifter the basis of the circuit
    is a linear resistance potentiometer divided by tappings into
    four equal sections neighbouring sections being fed by a pair
    of transformer secondaries with voltages phase separated by the
    value of the potentiometer resistance is not critical providing
    it is large compared with the impedance of the transformer
    secondaries
