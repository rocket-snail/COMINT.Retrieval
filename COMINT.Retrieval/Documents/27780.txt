synthesis of unbalanced rlc networks each inductor of the
    network is assumed to have associated series resistance the
    method of synthesis makes use of novel features including the
    breakdown of a hurwitz polynomial into two others application
    of a network theorem to division of the network into two parts
    and a method of zero shifting with one pair of complex poles
    and being discussed in appendices the network realizes a
    minimum phase transfer function whose numerator and denominator
    are of degree not higher than the third and fourth respectively
    and whose poles and zeros may lie anywhere in the left half of
    the complex frequency plane extension of the procedure to
    functions of higher degree is considered briefly
