scientific and technical libraries. the 12th congress of
    the bulgarian communist party set important targets in respect
    of the national economic growth, the result of intensive
    application of chemistry, automation and robotics. scientific
    and technical libraries have a significant part to play
    assisting with their services in implementation of the targets.
    the majority of young scientists have a good command of at
    least 1 western language and russian literature is in general
    use. however, there is still much to be done to attract
    scientists and other experts who have been avoiding libraries
    so far. personal rapport with such people is decisive and
    librarians should draw ideas from instructive publications
    issued for this purpose by many central libraries. in addition
    to books, periodicals, patents, trade catalogues and secondary
    information sources have to be utilised to the full. libraries
    need equipment to be able to offer to their readers information
    on microform.
