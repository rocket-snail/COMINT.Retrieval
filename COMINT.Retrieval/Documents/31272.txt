localization of aurorae with high power radar technique
    using a rotating antenna radar equipment with a peak pulse
    power of pulse width and element yagi aerial rotating at rpm
    has been used since may at kiruna geophysical observatory for
    the location of aurorae preliminary results of the observations
    indicate good correlation between auroral activity geomagnetic
    activity and the appearance of the n layer a special type of
    sporadic e ionization often appearing in connection with
    magnetic bays the distribution in range and bearing of the
    recorded aurorae agrees with the simple theory that most of the
    radio wave scattering comes from those points where the radar
    beam is perpendicular to the surface of the auroral discharges
    the calculated height distributions of the reflection centres
    have maxima around km
