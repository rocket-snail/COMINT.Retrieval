regional collaboration in the swedish library system.
    contribution to an issue devoted to public library services in
    sweden. sweden's public libraries are basically operated by the
    local authorities. the state can provide grants to level out
    standards but does not interfere in the running of local
    libraries, and sweden has no libraries act. municipal
    authorities themselves decide the objectives, scale and
    structure of their library services. all of sweden's 279
    municipalities provide municipal library services. certain
    library functions would be too expensive to operate on a purely
    municipal basis-it is therefore rational and efficient to
    transfer these to the regional or supramunicipal-that is,
    county-level.
