plasma oscillations in crossed electric and magnetic
    fields an idealized case is considered and the specific
    structure which retards the em waves is replaced by a medium
    with an effective dielectric constant greater thn than unity it
    is also assumed that the constant charge and current of the
    electron beam are compensated by the charge and current of ions
    which do not participate in the hf oscillations with these
    assumptions conditions are determined under which the electron
    beam becomes unstable the fluctuations of the velocity and
    density of the beam increasing indefinitely
