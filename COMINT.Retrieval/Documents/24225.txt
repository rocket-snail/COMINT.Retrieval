popular fiction selection in public libraries:
    implications of popular culture studies. proposes that public
    librarians, in selecting popular fiction, abolish the conflict
    between high values and 'low' tastes by formulating selection
    plans in which value is instrumental-conditional upon the
    degree to which a work of fiction meets or fails to meet
    identified needs. in this way they will come to understand the
    ways in which existing works serve the reading public's needs,
    and serve the public better.
