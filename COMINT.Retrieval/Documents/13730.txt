dielectric potentiometers a voltage divider is described
    comprising a movable electrode and a system of fixed electrodes
    all immersed in a lossy liquid dielectric so that the paths
    between the electrodes are both resistive and capacitive the
    arrangement is suitable for wide band operation since the
    product of the equivalent parallel resistance and capacitance
    is a constant depending only on the nature of the dielectric
    various practical embodiments are described desirable
    characteristics for the dielectric are indicated
