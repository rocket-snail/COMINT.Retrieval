concerning the minimum number of resonators and the
    minimum unloaded q needed in a filter the number of resonator
    elements required to meet given specifications of filter
    characteristics and the lowest no load values of q which the
    resonators may have can be deduced from the formulae and graphs
    given the specifications include the accept and reject
    bandwidths the peak valley ripple ratio and response in the
    reflect band of the selective circuit both constant k and m
    derived types of filter are considered and numerical examples
    are worked out
