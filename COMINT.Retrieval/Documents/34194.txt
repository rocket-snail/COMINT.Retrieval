atomic nitrogen as a constituent for region three
    temperature height models are considered the nicolet mange
    model the possible upper limit of temperature height gradient
    and an intermediate model for these particle concentration with
    height the rate coefficient of reaction with height and the
    height and concentration of maximum ionization are critically
    discussed and computed the level of maximum ionization produced
    by photo ionization of atomic nitrogen lies between depending
    on the model considered the concentration of atomic nitrogen at
    the height at which diffusive separation takes place need not
    be assumed to be greater than hence atomic nitrogen could
    contribute at least in part to the layery ionization the
    possibility of ionization of atomic oxygen at the third
    ionization potential is briefly discussed
