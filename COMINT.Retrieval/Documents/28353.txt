here the grassroots are stored in archives. describes a
    visit by danish library school students to amsterdam. the group
    saw the department of social information at amsterdam
    university library. the department began in 1969 with the gift
    of the 'provo' movement's archives; it now serves as an
    archives and documentation centre for materials of social
    movements from the whole world. the materials range from books
    and records to badges and t-shirts. such unusual materials
    demand untraditional methods of acquisition, registration and
    retrieval; none of the staff was qualified in librarianship.
    describes an alternative advice centre or 'legal shop'
    (rechtswinkel), staffed by volunteer law students. a visit was
    paid to the vrije archief, an archive which aids squatters'
    actions by making available town planning information. library
    methods and cooperation with public libraries were not regarded
    as of value to any of these centres, and amsterdam's main
    public library, housed in a new building, b ut lacking
    literature on community information, was not planning to
    cooperate with the centres either.
