an evaluation of some conflation algorithms for
    information retrieval. a conflation algorithm identifies word
    variants and reduces them to a single canonical form. discusses
    its characteristics and gives examples of some types which have
    been used in computerised information retrieval systems.
    comparative experiments with a range of keyword dictionaries
    and with the cranfield documentation test collection suggest
    that there is relatively little difference in the performance
    of the algorithms despite the disparate means by which they
    have been developed and by which they operate.
