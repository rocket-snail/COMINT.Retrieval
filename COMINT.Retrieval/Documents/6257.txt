theory of the boella effect a discussion of the mechanism
    causing the drop in the resistance of composition resistors at
    hf abstracts a similar variation of resistance with frequency
    has been observed in electrolytic solutions effect comparative
    measurements were made on resistors of three different types
    namely ceramic rod with helical carbon film low resistance type
    carbon resin composition in ceramic case high resistance type
    and capillary tube containing a solution of cuso in water
    electrolyte type the boella effect was most marked in case
    variation of resistance with electric field strength is also
    observed the explanation given is alternative to that of
