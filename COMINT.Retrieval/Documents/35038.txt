narrowing effect of dipole forces on inhomogeneously
    broadened lines observations of the effect in mn ferrite and
    yttrium iron garnet are described the theory for cases in which
    the spatial period of the inhomogeneity is large compared to
    atomic distances and is either short or comparable to sample
    size is discussed and its applications are considered
