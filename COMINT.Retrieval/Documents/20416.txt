some designs of ladder filter results obtained and
    methods of calculation the principle of matching half sections
    and transforming impedances in designing filters with a minimum
    number of components is illustrated in two examples a narrow
    band band pass filter for and a filter with a pass band centred
    on formulae relating to the transformation of t type
    quadripoles to type and vice versa and to various types of
    quadripoles for impedance matching are collected in
    appendices
