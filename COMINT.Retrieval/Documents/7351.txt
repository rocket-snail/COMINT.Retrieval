a theory of time series for waveform transmission systems
    a theoretical study is made of time series suitable for
    application to low pass systems with a fixed upper limit to the
    pass band for division and inversion of time series algebraic
    division is not in general legitimate for time series related
    to bandwidth limitation although it is legitimate for certain
    other forms of time series more general methods of inversion
    are treated and an iterative method which can always be used is
    discussed in detail and a practical computing scheme is
    outlined see also of january lewis which also deals with the
    time series method
