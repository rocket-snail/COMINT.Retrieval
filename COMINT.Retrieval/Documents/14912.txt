library work with children in developing countries.
    report on the ifla/unesco seminar for librarians from
    developing countries on library work for children and young
    people, leipzig, aug 81. the basic theme was discussed with
    reference to individual countries in africa, asia and latin
    america, where many children attend school only briefly or not
    at all, so they remain illiterate. many parents are also
    illiterate so reading in leisure hours is not encouraged. what
    school books and lessons there are exist only in an official
    language, generally that of a colonising power. there is a lack
    of published material in local languages, some of which have
    never even been written down. in these countries a library
    network must be established and the growth of reading
    encouraged with the help of professional and voluntary staff.
    library service for the handicapped pose special
    problems.
