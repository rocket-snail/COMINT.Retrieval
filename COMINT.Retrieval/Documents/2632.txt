the magnetic field of a model radiation belt numerically
    computed the magnetic field of a model ring current belt is
    calculated numerically over the earths surface the field of the
    ring current is nearly uniform although the diamagnetism of the
    belt produces an insignificant irregularity in the disturbance
    field in auroral latitudes
