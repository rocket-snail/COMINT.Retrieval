the work of the study group of directors of university
    libraries. in the library system of east germany, the
    university libraries of berlin, dresden, greifswald, halle,
    jena, leipzig and rostock play an important part in
    inter-library loan schemes and in the acquisition of
    specialised stocks. in 1980 these universities owned total
    stocks of 18 million items. the study group provides advice on
    organisation, with particular reference to the development of
    the unified system of a central university library with
    associated branches and promotes exchanges and analyses of
    experience. the group is currently concentrating on
    inter-library cooperation within subject networks, with a view
    to imrpoving purchasing policy. improvements must also be made
    in the cooperation between university libraries, information
    centres and research, in user training and in the application
    of technology.
