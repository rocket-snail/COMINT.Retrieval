on the orientation of auroral arcs the diurnal variation
    in the direction of quiet arcs at kiruna is similar to the
    theoretical variation expected r from alvens theory the average
    arc direction near the auroral zone seems to be determined for
    a given time by projections of circles in the geomagnetic
    equatorial plane on to the earths surface along the geomagnetic
    field lines
