corona discharge tubes for voltage stabilization the
    mechanism of the corona discharge is briefly described by
    reference to the current voltage characteristic of the glow
    discharge tube the construction processing and performance of
    experimental coaxial types of tube are discussed the data
    presented are sufficient for the design of tubes with
    regulating voltages between and operating at currents up to at
    least such tubes can be made with characteristics stable for
    over hours
