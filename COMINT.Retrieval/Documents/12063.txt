theory of nonlinear coupling in a novel ferro electric
    device a device which can be used as a modulator or as a
    frequency divider or multiplier comprises a block of
    ferroelectric material witnh electrodes arranged on two pairs
    of facing sides on connecting an inductance across one pair of
    electrodes a resonant circuit is provided in which the
    capacitance varies periodically oscillations being sustained
    when the frequency of this parametric excitation is twice the
    resonance frequency of the circuit analysis is presented using
    the mathieu equation
