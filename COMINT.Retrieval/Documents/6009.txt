dekatrons and electromechnical registers operated by
    transistors transistor circuits are described for driving cold
    cathode decade tubes and electromechanical counters in both
    cases the transistor circuit combines the waveform shaping
    properties of the thermionic valve with the economy of power
    achieved with the cold cathode valve high reliability of
    performance is also attained
