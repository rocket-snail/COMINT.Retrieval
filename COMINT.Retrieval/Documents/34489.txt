training information science professionals. discusses
    issues raised in curriculum planning and development for a
    postgraduate course in information science. considers
    information science as an interdisciplinary subject area
    concerned with the efficient communication of its substantive
    nucleus, information. accordingly, teaching programmes are
    required to cover both academic instruction and practical
    application, with the curriculum itself serving as a model of
    efficient communication. the question then necessarily arises
    whether courses should be oriented towards instilling the
    existing corpus of cognitive information, or in developing
    capabilities for dealing with present and future needs. whereas
    academic training emphasises the search for truth, professional
    training requires preparation for decision making. proposes in
    conclusion a model of curriculum organisation encompassing both
    theory and application.
