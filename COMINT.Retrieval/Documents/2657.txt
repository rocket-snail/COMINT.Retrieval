a coaxial magic t the basic design consists of a coaxial
    line t junction including a shielded loop whose axis is located
    at the centre of the t the operation is similar to that of the
    hybrid coil or the waveguide magic t two modifications are
    described one using direct coupling between the loop and the
    loads standing wave characteristics of experimental models for
    operation at wavelengths of about cm are given a swr can be
    obtained over a frequency band of about application to phase
    measurements is described briefly
