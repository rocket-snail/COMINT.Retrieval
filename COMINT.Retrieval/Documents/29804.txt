the results of the activities of the czechoslovak sti
    system in the period of the 6th 5-year plan. the main
    directions in the development of the czechoslovak sti system in
    the years 1976-80 were determined by the objectives of the
    state information programme. new branch information centres
    were established in several branches of science and industry,
    thus bringing the total number of branch centres to 2,081 and
    the total number of their staff to 9,271 in 1980. the
    development of automated processing of bibliographic and
    non-bibliographic information was influenced by the activities
    of the central technological base (ctb) of costei in prague. 11
    bibliographical data bases from abroad and 9 domestic ones are
    used in various branches and subject. ctb operates 2 data bases
    of central inventories (research reports and dissertations,
    and, reports of business journeys), a union catalogue of
    foreign periodicals and the slovak national bibliography. some
    selected processes of several major librarie s were also
    computerised in the given period.
