oscillations in the refraction of radio waves emitted by
    the sun radio astronomy observations at sunrise in november and
    december at wavelengths of and showed a periodic variation of
    ionospheric refraction with uniform change of zenith distance
    of the sun this variation is analysed in terms of sunspot
    activity and the motion of cellular waves in the ionosphere see
