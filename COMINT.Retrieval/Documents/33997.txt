note on a mechanism for the vertical transport of
    ionization in the ionosphere vertically travelling gravity
    waves can produce corresponding vertical movements of dense
    layers of ionization which are formed at alternate nodes of the
    wave system the combined effects of coexistent standing and
    travelling waves are considered
