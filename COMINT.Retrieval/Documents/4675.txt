a new method of solving the problem of the diffraction of
    electromagnetic waves by a thin conducing disk the problem is
    reduced to the determination of two functions each of which
    satisfies a fredholm integral equation which can be solved by
    numerical methods a simple formula for the scattering
    coefficient is derived
