oclc's database conversion' a user's perspective.
    describes the experience of a large academic library with
    headings in the oclc data base that have been converted to
    aacr2 form. it also considers the use of lc authority records
    in the data base. specific problems are discussed, including
    some resulting from lc practices. nevertheless, the presence of
    the authority records, and especially the conversion of about
    40% of the headings in the bibliographic file, has been of
    great benefit to the library, significantly speeding up the
    cataloguing operation.
