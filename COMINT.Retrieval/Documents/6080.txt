the results are in-preservation workshops are wanted.
    until recently, library schools in the us have offered little
    or nothing in their curriculum about preservation of library
    materials. a project, initiated by the library/binders
    committee of the ala preservation of library materials section,
    was carried out to determine the extent and nature of the
    interest in preservation workshops. attendees of recent
    workshops were surveyed, and respondees indicated an
    overwhelming desire to attend more workshops and to recommend
    workshop attendance to their colleagues. responses are
    tabulated in relation to assessment of responses about
    preservation workshops and interest in preservation workshop
    topics.
