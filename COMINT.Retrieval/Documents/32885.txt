faculty status for librarians in the rocky mountain
    region' a review and analysis. responses to a questionnaire
    from 64 4-year colleges and universities in the rocky mountain
    region reveal that 62 of the schools grant some of their
    librarians faculty status, and that 40 grant faculty status to
    all librarians. the greatest discrepancy in benefits received
    by teaching and library faculty arises in length of contract
    year and publishing responsibilities. directors of only 12 of
    the 40 libraries note controversy over faculty status for
    librarians, yet comments on the questionnaire and the results
    themselves suggest otherwise. also, respondents' uncertainty
    about their responsibilities and benefits indicates a lack of
    knowledge of what faculty status should mean to and for
    them.
