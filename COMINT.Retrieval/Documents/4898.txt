quantum fluctuations and noise in parametric processes
    part a quantum mechanical model for parametric interactions is
    used to evaluate the effect of the measuring amplifying process
    on the statistical properties of radiation parametric
    amplifying process on the statistical properties of radiation
    parametric amplification is shown to be ideal in the sense that
    it allows a simultaneous determination of the phase and number
    of quanta of an electromagnetic wave with an accuracy which is
    limited only by the uncertainty principle frequency conversion
    via parametric processes is whown to be free of zero point
