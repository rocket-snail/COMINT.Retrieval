adjusted age distribution and its application to impact
    factor and immediacy index. for the age count between citing
    and cited papers, the difference in the year of publication is
    widely used. in some cases, the frequency obtained is
    inaccurate because of age bias. describes a probabilistic
    method for adjusting the raw frequency, and its application to
    the impact factor and immediacy index in journal evaluation.
    the main procedure is that &b of the raw frequency at any
    given age is assigned to the previous age and to the following
    age, respectively. adjusting the frequency over all ages of
    use, the curve representing the age distribution becomes
    smoother.
