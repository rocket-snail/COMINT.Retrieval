odd integer magnetic frequency multipliers for various
    applications in the frequency f range frequency multiplication
    can be performed more efficiently by magnetic than by
    electronic equipment the operation of the magnetic m multiplier
    is analysed and experimental units are described for higher
    multiples multistage arrangements are preferred harmonic
    distortion can be kept low by suitable choice of core
    materials
