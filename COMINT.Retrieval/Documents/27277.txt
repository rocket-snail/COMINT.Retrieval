the norwegian dewey committee-what do they really do?.
    the norwegian dewey committee was established by the state
    library service and the national library office to advise on
    dewey classification in norway. its new geographical tables
    (suggestions, not instructions), aim to help, for instance,
    libraries with large local collections. basically they follow
    ddc 19, dividing norway into 4 main sections (as against the
    earlier arnesen division into 3) with further divisions by
    county, district and local authority. comments from libraries
    were invited: 1 suggestion that arnesen notation should be
    retained for north norway has been accepted for future us
    editions. a new edition of arnesen (the current norwegian
    version of dewey, based on ddc 17) is being undertaken by the
    norwegian library association. there will be major changes in
    the 300 classes, corresponding to ddc 19. supplementary tables,
    notes and indexes will be improved, and libraries will be able
    to classify broadly or more precisely as required.
