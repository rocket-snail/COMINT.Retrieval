synthesis of paralleled terminal rc networks to provide
    complex zeros in the transfer function an improvement n the
    method given by guillemin of is described which required fewer
    paralleled networks the desired transfer ratio is converted
    into the sum of several transfer ratios each of which can be
    realized with a single ladder network a method of synthesis for
    these networks in terms of a common driving point admittance
    function is described and theory developed for their connection
    in parallel
