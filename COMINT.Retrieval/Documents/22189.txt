characteristics of the van allen radiation zones as
    measured by the scintillation counter on explorer results were
    obtained over a period of four weeks from a counter recording
    fluxes of electrons above and protons above a geomagnetic storm
    which occurred about a week after launching the satellite
    produced an immediate increase in the counting rate large
    fluctuations in particle intensity were observed at the d edge
    of the outer van allen belt during the storm which were closely
    related to simultaneous geomagnetic activity
