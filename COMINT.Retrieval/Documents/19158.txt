campania' aspects of the library situation. a
    comprehensive description of existing services in a southern
    italian region before the earthquake in nov 80, showing the
    total inadequacy of library provision, and absence of any
    official recognition of the need for legislative initiatives
    and a comprehensive policy to develop services and provide
    training for librarians. reliable statistics are unavailable,
    but sufficient evidence is presented to demonstrate that both
    in naples and throughout the region, the majority of libraries
    are restricted to university users or other privileged groups,
    and public access to reading is extremely limited. any
    activities to develop library services have been isolated
    initiatives, without recognition of the importance of the role
    of the library in the community; expansion is haphazard and the
    concepts of library cooperation and network planning utterly
    unknown. suggestions are made for the creation of regional
    centres as a 1st step in ameliorating the situati on. a note
    calls attention to the increased urgency for action following
    destruction of library buildings by earthquake, and an appendix
    deals with the problems of rescuing archives now at risk
    because of earthquake damage.
