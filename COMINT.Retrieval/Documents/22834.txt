longitudinal studies of book availability. reviews 6
    experimental studies of book availability conducted at the 2
    major libraries of case western reserve university, ohio-the
    sears library (physical and biological sciences, engineering,
    management, and economics) and the freiberger library (social
    and behavioural sciences and the humanities). the studies show
    how certain management decisions have influenced book
    availability in these libraries and how certain other events,
    over which management had little control, have compromised
    efforts to improve book availability.
