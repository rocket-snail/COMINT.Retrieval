    and future possibilities. this report on the problems facing
    editors of professional information and library science

    such products are in short supply. areas addressed include (1)
    historical background, (2) professional organisations, (3) the
    paucity of authors, (4) professional responsibilties, (5)
    editors' requirements, (6) unwanted articles, (7) the
    industrial world's problems, and (8) the need for a centralised
    clearinghouse. report not available from ntis.
