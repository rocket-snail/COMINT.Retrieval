interaction of electromagnetic waves of radio frequency
    in isothermal plasmas collision cross section of helium atoms
    and ions for electrons theoretical and practical aspects of the
    laboratory experiments described previously are discussed and
    results of measurements using he gas are presented the ratio of
    the effective cross sections of ions and atoms for electron
    collisions is about at an ion density of at room
