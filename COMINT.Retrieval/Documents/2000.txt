oscillators and their modes of oscillation a
    classification of oscillators in three types is proposed based
    on the parameters of the passive frequency determining
    quadripole which together with an active quadripole constitutes
    the oscillator several basic circuits are analysed in this way
    and the q factor of their modes of oscillation is
    evaluated
