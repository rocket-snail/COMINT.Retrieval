e region during the solar eclipse of february analysis of
    observations of e layer critical frequencies at khartoum during
    the eclipse indicates tht the ionizing radiation from the solar
    disk is not uniformly distributed as is also the case for the
    optical radiation part of the u nonuniform component of the
    ionizing radiation appears to be divided about equally between
    the east and west limbs of the sun this is consistent with
    observations made at meudon of the distribution over the suns
    disk of the intensity of the green coronal line the main
    discrepancy between the values of the parameter proportional to
    the radiation flux calculated from the coronal data and from
    the e region measurements appears abruptly just after totality
    and suggests the existence of an intense source of ionizing
    radiation near the west limb of the sun which cannot be
    explained in terms of solar data available at present
