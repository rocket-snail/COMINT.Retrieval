a chromium corundum paramagnetic amplifier and generator
    note on the operation of a paramagnetic amplifier and generator
    using a single crystal of levels characterized by the quantum
    numbers when the crystalline axis is oriented parallel to the
    constant external magnetic field are used absorption lines for
    different power levels of the auxiliary radiation are
    shown
