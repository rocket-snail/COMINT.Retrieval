saturation effects in ferrite frequency doublers
    operating in the uniform precession mode three distinct
    saturation mechanisms occurring in ferrite frequency doublers
    are described an approximate nonlinear equation of motion
    including the effect of the reaction field is obtained and
    solved for a particular case
