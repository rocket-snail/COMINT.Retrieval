crystal diodes in voltage dividers in particular for
    increasing the linearity and slope of static and dynamic
    characteristics hf voltage dividers are discussed comprising a
    diode in series with a passive element the voltage division
    ratio being varied by suitably controlling the diode
    applications to reactance valve fm circuits are
