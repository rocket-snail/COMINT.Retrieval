transducer design for ultrasonic delay lines the
    suitability of quartz and transducers is considered for use in
    conjunction with and bonds between transducer and delay medium
    to widen the pass band a relative bandwidth of can
    theoretically be obtained using a transducer composed of with
    and with a bond to a fused silica delay line using quartz
    transducers a relative bandwidth of was obtained experimentally
    with a plastic bond and of with a solder bond theory based on
    equivalent circuits is given
