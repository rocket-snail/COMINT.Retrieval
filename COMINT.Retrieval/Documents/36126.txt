the diffraction of an electromagnetic plane wave by a
    perfectly conducting half plane electromagnetic waves in
    isotropic and crystalline media characterized by permittivity
    with spatial dispersion the necessity of taking account of
    spatial dispersion in non gyrotropic media in relation to the
    permittivity tensor and also in the analysis of longitudinal
    plasma waves propagating in an isotropic medium or along the
    principal dielectric axes in crystals is stressed collrvyive
    energy losses and the cherenkov effect are also
    considered
