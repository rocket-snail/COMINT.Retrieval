experiments and analysis on a computer interface to an
    information retrieval network. a primary goal of this project
    was to develop an interface that would provide direct access
    for inexperienced users to existing on-line bibliographic
    information retrieval networks. the experiment tested the
    concept of a virtual-system mode of access to a network of
    heterogeneous interactive retrieval systems and data bases. an
    experimental translating computer interface named conit was
    developed as a research test vehicle. the interface was
    designed to make the basic functions of 3 different
    bibliographic retrieval systems easy to use, even by
    inexperienced users, by providing a simplified common command
    language coupled with extensive on-line instruction. report not
