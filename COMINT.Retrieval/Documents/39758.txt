on the realisation of user training for students at a
    college of education. the progress of user training for
    students at the erfurt/mulhausen college of education was
    outlined at a meeting of the university libraries' study group
    at the ministry for public education (ministerium fur
    volksbildung) in june 80. it has proved difficult to interest
    all the teachers at the college in the subject and to impress
    on them the importance of user training to the students. it is
    planned to hold meetings and discussions to show teachers
    methods of user training and of putting the acquired knowledge
    to the test. student user training consists of a tour around
    the library, and library departments, lectures in college and
    at the library and practical tests in using catalogues and
    other information sources. the knowledge gained by the students
    should be employed in working independently in the catalogue
    section, using a wider range of reference literature and
    preparing their final thesis.
