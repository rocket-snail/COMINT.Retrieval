shock spectrum computer for frequencies up to an
    arrangement for investigating the effects of mechanical shock
    on electronic equipment installed in guided missiles comprises
    an analogue computer which operates on an accelerometer signal
    either direct or recorded and solves the differential equation
    for the part involved the result being displayed on a screen
    the computer can be tuned up to thus covering the range within
    which the fundamental resonance of any delicate structure is
    likely to occur
