parametric amplification and frequency mixing
    inpropagating circuits an analysis is given of the properties
    of time varying distributed reactance in propagating structures
    which may have positive or negative phase and group velocities
    power at different frequencies may be converted from one
    frequency to the others and the amplitudes of the waves may
    vary exponentially or periodically depending on the relation of
    the frequencies and of the phase constants between the
    propagating waves and the variable coupling reactance

    channel selectors wide band amplifiers tunable narrow band
    amplifiers and oscillators are described
