price/performance patterns of u.s. computer systems
    econometric models of the u.s. computer market have been
    developed to study the relationships between system price and
    hardware performance. single measures of price/performance such
    as "grosch's law" are shown to be so over simplified as to be
    meaningless. multiple-regression models predicting system cost
    as a function of several hardware characteristics do, however,
    reveal a market dichotomy. on one hand there exists a stable,
    price predictable market for larger, general purpose computer
    systems. the other market is the developing one for small
    business computer systems, a market which is relatively
    unstable with low price predictability. april, 1979 cale, e.g.
