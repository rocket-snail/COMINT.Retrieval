dynamo theory of geomagnetic tides plasma theory and
    results of earlier analysis of july are applied in deriving a
    differential equation expressing height integrated ionospheric
    current as a function of latitude taking account of coriolis
    forces and assuming a velocity amplitude of for tidal
    oscillations at e layer height the calculated magnitude of
    geomagnetic tides is in agreement with recorded data in
    particular as regards the large tidal amplitudes at the
    magnetic equator the theory is consistent with the assumption
    that the negative particles in the e layer are predominantly
    electrons rather than ions
