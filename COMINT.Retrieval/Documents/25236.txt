wave hypothesis of moving irregularities in the
    ionosphere a preliminary discussion of magneto hydrodynamic
    effects which may afford an alternative explanation of the
    motion of ionospheric irregularities usually referred to as
    winds in terms of the propagation of a wave like disturbance it
    is found that travelling atmospheric disturbances governed by
    pressure oscillations and gravitational forces will be
    accompanied by em oscillations which can under special
    resonance conditions become large the corresponding
    amplification of the associated electron motions would render
    such disturbances particularly susceptible to detection by
    radio methods gravity tends to confine the movement of these
    disturbances to the horizontal plane but a secondary vertical
    component is possible a full treatment is to be published
    later
