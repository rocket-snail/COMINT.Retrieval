every picture tells a story. cambridgeshire public
    libraries, hungtingdon division, have designed a new labelling
    system for the categorisation of library materials. the system
    was designed to have meaning to both the staff and public, and
    copyright free designs were sought. each sign is reprinted
    here. they include a star-shaped badge for westerns, a flower
    for gardening and plants, a tank for war, and a clown's face
    for 'funny stories'. there are 2 categories of symbols-1 for
    adults and 1 for children.
