the stability of quartz oscillators supposing a a series
    connected crystal in a resonant lc circuit to be short
    circuited the relative detuning f due to the presence of the
    crystal is termed the stabilization factor different
    arrangements of meissner hartley and colpitts circuits are
    considered the most stable circuit is one in which f is a
    maximum compatible with oscillation and is independent of
    change in the valve interlectrode capacitance and the load
    current through the crystal the properties of a circuit in
    which the crystal acts as an inductance are similar in all
    respects to those of a circuit with the crystal operating at
    series resonance
