converting direct voltage to alternating voltage at high
    power description of a unit providing a supply for a radio
    beacon at schiphol an inverter circuit with balanced hg vapour
    filled thyratrons is used and the maximum continuous power
    output is with an overall efficiency of considerably higher
    supply frequencies can be provided by using thyratrons with
    different gas fillings
