satellite sounder and telemeter chart ionosphere electron
    density a satellite borne ionosonde is described which is to be
    launched into a orbit by the usa measurements will be made on
    six log spaced frequencies between and by transmitting pulses
    of each frequency in turn crossed dipole receiving aerials are
    connected in phase quadrature and the receiver is arranged to
    receive echo pulses of one polarization and then pulses of
    opposite polarization a transistorized transmitter gives z peak
    power of with pulse length data will be recorded by the
    satellite and transmitted on command to ground stations
