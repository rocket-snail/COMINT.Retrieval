the power of nonsinusoidal systems a calculation is made
    of the instantaneous power absorbed by a series lrc circuit
    with a nonsinusoidal periodic applied voltage the square of the
    apparent power is the sum of the squares of l all the component
    powers for all the harmonics including so called mutual terms
    involving harmonics of different order
