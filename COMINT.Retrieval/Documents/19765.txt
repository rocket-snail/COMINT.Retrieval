the technique of parsifal. experiment with on-line
    catalogue searching in copenhagen city libraries. part 2'
    technical description of a pilot project. for part i 2see1
    81/5842. describes the experiment's phase 0, which relates to a
    pilot project based on limited data and an unaltered search
    system' the library school's subject retrieval system (bes).
    the phase has the following components' 1. transfer of
    catalogue entries from kommunedata to recku (the regional
    computer centre of copenhagen university). 2. change of format
    from the bc format (danmarc) to the bes format; lists the bes
    search codes used, with an example. 3. building up of search
    registers, with list of taboo words. 4. demonstration runs.
    concludes that phase 0 has shown that data compiled for use in
    printed catalogues can be used in an on-line system. some
    problems in connection with input of foreign language items
    remain. the system enables search via dk5, author and title
    like manual catalogues, but also terms in the title and note
    fields and other combinations. although subject searches were
    not included, the bes program makes input of subject search
    words possible.
