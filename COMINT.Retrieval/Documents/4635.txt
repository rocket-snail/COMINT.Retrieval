models of the lower ionosphere as may be inferred from
    absorption results values of deviative and nondeviative
    absorption and their variations with cos are calculated for the
    d region models of nertney of piggott unpublished and mitra and
    for the e region model of jones of satisfactory agreement with
    experimental results is found for mitras model of the d region
    but not for jones model of the e region
