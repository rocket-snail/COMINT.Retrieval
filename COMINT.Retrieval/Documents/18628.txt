dedicated and unconventional library works' impressions
    from birmingham. birmingham has 1 of the largest and best
    library systems in europe, with a total library budget of over
    7 million pounds and over 2 million stock items for 1 million
    inhabitants. striking features of the central library include a
    quick reference and trade section of over 7,000 works and 7
    reference departments. the 45 branches divide into 4 regional
    groups in order to maintain close contact with the central
    library but yet retain a measure of independence. many cope
    with social problems, especially in the inner city area. an
    ethnic minorities librarian coordinates all services to foreign
    readers. study groups organise projects on reference material,
    library publications, radio programmes and staff training. in
    contrast with many german libraries, services for children are
    given particular prominence; in addition to sections in each
    branch library there are also 2 central children's
    libraries.
