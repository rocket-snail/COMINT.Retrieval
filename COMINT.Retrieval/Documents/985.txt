electron energy distributions in stationary discharges
    extension of previous analysis of to the case of a stationary
    discharge in a dc space charge field the effect of the space
    charge is to increase the proportion of high energy electrons
    this results in a higher ionization rate but the effect is not
    large enough to account for low maintenance potentials observed
    in positive columns and in microwave discharges in inert
    gases
