frequency drift of short time transients in solar radio
    noise an analysis of records made at oslo on a two channel
    receiver is being made to give a detailed study of solar noise
    storm bursts channels are centred on and bandwidth is time
    constant and noise factor about it is suggested that the
    transients in most cases have a frequency drift in either
    direction ranging from about to higher values
