formation of the geomagnetic storm main phase ring
    current the main phase ring current is supposed to be generated
    by heating the exospheric gas by hydromagnetic shock waves the
    more energetic component consists of protons a flux hydrogen
    atoms should be observed at the base of the exosphere and the
    decay time of the ring should be less at sunspot minimum than
    at sunspot maximum by a factor of three
