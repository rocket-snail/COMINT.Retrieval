self consistent electrodynamics the idea of direct action
    between streams is applied to a continuous charged fluid and
    com ined with the new formulation of the electrodynamical laws
    of motion in terms of conservation of circulation a simple and
    rigorous integrated formulation is thus obtained from the
    maxwell lorentz differential equations applicable to co
    existing positive and negative fluids as well as vacuum exact
    solutions are obtained among them one which represents self
    consistent self maintained flow in a hollow tubular region of
    infinite axial extent it is hoped this tube might be bent into
    a torus and that an electron model will result from merely
    quantizing the one or two vortices around which this flow
    pattern circulates
