a magnetic thyratron grid control circuit a circuit
    described previously is modified by including an source and a
    rectifier in the secondary circuit of the grid transformer
    changing the mode of operation to that of a reset magnetic
    amplifier a range of firing voltage phase is available the
    firing voltage builds up rapidly
