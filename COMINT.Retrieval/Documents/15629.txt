the mavar a low noise microwave amplifier the operation
    of the maver mixer amplification by variable reactance requires
    a lossless nonlinear reactance exhibiting negative resistance
    under certain conditions low noise amplification is achieved at
    room temperature the performance and the operation of the main
    types of parametric amplifier are outlined
