nesseby library' a big effort for a small authority.
    nesseby, in northern norway, is large in area (1,438 sq.kil.)
    but small in population (1,120 inhabitants). after many years
    of inadequate library accommodation, a new community centre
    including a library was opened in 1980, so welcome that the
    increased financial burden is not resented. the library is in
    the basement, but sloping ground allows ample window space. for
    the 1st time there is a loan counter, a librarian's office, and
    adequate access to the 4,500 books. the addition of a proposed
    mobile library would ensure a good library service to the area,
    though expansion will be necessary in time.
