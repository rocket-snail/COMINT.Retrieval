iron free cylindrical coils with reduced external field
    the design of coils with zero magnetic moment is described and
    the necessary formulae are given the arrangement consists of
    three coaxial coils connected so that the outer coil produces a
    field opposing that of the two inner coils and of such
    magnitude as to reduce the external field to nearly zero the
    internal field is approximately equal to that of the innermost
    coil alone coils of this type are useful eg for focusing
    electron beams for magnetic measurements and for inductance
