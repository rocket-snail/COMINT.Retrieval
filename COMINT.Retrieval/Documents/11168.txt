secondary services in the social sciences' the need for
    improvement and the role of librarians. research based at the
    university of bath, uk, during 1967-75 (including the
    investigation into information requirements of the social
    sciences (infross) and design of information systems in the
    social sciences (disiss) projects) showed indexing and
    abstracting services in the social sciences to be numerous,
    uncoordinated, often poorly designed, and greatly underused.
    obstacles to improvement include the non-commercial nature of
    many services, relatively small and poor market, main buyers
    (libraries) not being the users, and generally little
    incentive. in the long term, a totally automated system could
    be the solution. meanwhile, libraries can improve the situation
    by conducting evaluation studies, cancelling poor services,
    pressing for the improvement of good services, and encouraging
    users to be more demanding.
