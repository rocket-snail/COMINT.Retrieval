a view from bangladesh. contribution to a section devoted
    to planning interlending systems for developing countries. an
    interlending system is vital for the development and support of
    literacy, education and research, and of industry and the
    economy generally. interlending takes place in bangladesh
    between certain groups of libraries but progress is hampered by
    the lack of a strong national library to give leadership in
    shared acquisition and interlending policies. another problem
    arises because different types of library come under different
    government departments, with no coordination agency. progress
    will depend on systematic cooperation between libraries.
