efficiency of bibliographic information work in district
    libraries. the starting point for the formulation of a
    bibliographic system model is the interaction between
    bibliographic services and its user categories; this takes into

    individual and society's needs. very important is the
    cooperation between individual bibliographic information
    services which should be integrated into a wider bibliographic
    system. a study of the actual state of affairs in district
    libraries showed, however, some shortcomings.
