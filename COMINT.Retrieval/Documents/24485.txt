irreversible thermodynamics and kinetic theory in the
    derivation of thermoelectric relations considerations of
    irreversible thermodynamics simplify the determination of
    thermoelectric coefficients using kinetic theory arguments
    based on boltzmanns equation a new expression for thomsons
    coefficient has been derived only simple models lave been used
    but the theory is capable of extension to more complex
    ones
