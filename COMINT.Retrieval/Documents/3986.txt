measurements of electron concentration in the ionosphere
    up to altitudes of carried out during the international
    geophysical year by means of radio wave transmissions from the
    geophysical rockets of the academy of sciences ussr the
    determination of electron density distributions from
    measurements of radio wave dispersion and the faraday effect
    are examined the results of three rocket flights to altitudes
    of in are described
