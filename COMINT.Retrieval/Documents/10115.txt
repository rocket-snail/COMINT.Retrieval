an analysis of the differences between density-of-use
    ranking and raw use ranking of library journal use. reports of
    journal titles ranked by use with space and cost information
    included for each title can provide a means for making certain
    objective journal collection development decisions. each title
    can be assessed in relation to the others and the data for all
    titles can be cumulated so that decisions can be made at
    various cutoff points. simple ranking of titles by raw use
    (rur) may be inadequate and should be adjusted by some measure
    to allow for how much of the title is available to the user at
    the time of the collection of the use data. if the raw-use
    frequency of a title is divided by the actual linear shelf
    space of the title's file, a 'density-of-use' frequency is
    obtained. if these frequencies are then ranked, a
    'density-of-use rank' (dur) is formed. some differences between
    rur and dur have been analysed.
