earth satellite observations of the ionosphere the
    various methods of deriving integrated electron content below a
    satellite are critically reviewed although the methods are
    theoretically capable of giving information of the diurnal
    seasonal and latitude variations of content interpretation of
    the measurements is difficult because of all these variations
    are present simultaneously hence some assumptions about one or
    two of the variables must be made in order that the third one
    may be studied
