investigation of the drifts of the effective point of
    radio reflection along a meteor train experimental evidence is
    given to support the postulate of the drift of the effective
    point of reflection along a meteor train towards the maximum
    echo duration level drift velocities tend to have higher values
    in the case of shorter echo durations and vice versa from
    theoretical considerations it is predicted that maximum echo
    durations always occur at about km below the height of maximum
    ionization the degree of turbulence is considered to be
    slightly greater than that suggested by manning but less than
    that by booker and cohen see also of rao
