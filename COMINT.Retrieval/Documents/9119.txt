control of glow discharge triodes by means of very small
    currents a discussion of the desirable characteristics of a
    valve suitable for the generation of sawtooth oscillations
    using a grid cathode capacitor of value between and and a grid
    control current as low as the essential design points are small
    cross sectional area of the discharge space high current
    density at low currents short ion transit times and large
    difference between the striking and the operating potential
    these are achieved by arranging a wire point control electrode
    close to the cathode
