the effect of diffusion on the vertical distribution of
    ionization in a quiet f region electrons are assumed to
    disappear by attachment to neutral molecules and by diffusion
    the coefficient of attachment is assumed to be constant while
    the diffusion constant is calculated according to classical
    theory using rocket measurements of air density and temperature
    the vertical distribution of electrons can be calculated the
    results are at variance with those actually observed possibly
    because the diffusion constant is much less than that
    assumed
