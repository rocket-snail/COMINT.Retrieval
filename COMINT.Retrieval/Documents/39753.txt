negative and oscillatory longitudinal magnetoresistance a
    report on the result of numerical calculations of
    semiconductors and semimetals for the case in which electron
    scattering is due to the acoustic modes of the lattice
    vibrations and the magnetic field is so large that the
    quantization of the electron orbit is important
