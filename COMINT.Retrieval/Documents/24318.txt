the specification of the properties of the thermistor as
    a circuit element in very low frequency systems an analysis
    based on sinusoidal applied voltages shows that a conductor
    whose resistance is a function of temperature may be
    represented by an equivalent circuit having a semicircular
    impedance locus an expression for the distortion of the
    waveform is also obtained and this is found to be small
    provided that the alternating current is less than a quarter of
    t steady polarizing current which flows in the conductor the
    impedance loci of a bead type thermistor are plotted by means
    of null technique a typical impedance varied from a negative
    resistance of at very low frequencies to a pure inductance of
    and then to a positive resistance of at high frequencies the
    use of the equivalent circuit is illustrated by designing phase
    shift networks suitable for use in the stabilizing of very low
    frequency control systems these circuits may be used in systems
    where either data transmission is employed
