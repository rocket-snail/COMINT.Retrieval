planning interlending systems in developing countries.
    based on reports describing the extent and development of
    interlibrary loan systems in several of the developing
    countries, a composite is drawn of the difficulties and
    problems which arise in the planning stages and execution of
    such systems in these countries. financial problems, as well as
    problems of library policy, and the realistic possibilities
    connected with the literature supply and corresponding need for
    an interlibrary loan programme in these countries are pointed
    out. attention is also given to the relationship of the local
    libraries to the national library. considerations which should
    be made in finding realistic solutions to these problems on a
    long-term basis conclude the report.
