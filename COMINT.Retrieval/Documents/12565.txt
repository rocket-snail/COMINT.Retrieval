reducing noise in a college library. increasing reports
    of noise in the library of the state university of new york
    college at cortland prompted interest in reducing noise levels.
    chairs, tables and carrels were adjacent and frequently
    arranged in clusters; previous research indicated that such an
    arrangement may increase talking and thus noise levels. it was
    hypothesised that disassembling the clusters and separating the
    3 types of furniture would reduce noise. a multiple baseline
    design was used with 2 measures of noise' an electromechanical
    (objective) system and subjective ratings of perceived noise.
    results showed no difference due to the objective measure but
    significant reductions in subjective ratings, f(1,773)#8.80,
    p5.005. compares the utility and validity of the 2 measures and
    discusses issues in noise control in libraries.
