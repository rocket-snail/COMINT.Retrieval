operational amplifier without a stabilized power supply a
    new operational amplifier is proposed in which two parallel
    circuits for low and high frequencies are used with a summing
    amplifier and two feedback circuits the theory of the amplifier
    is discussed and some experimental results are given for a
    mains voltage variation of the output voltage of the amplifier
    varies by with a drift rate of sec
