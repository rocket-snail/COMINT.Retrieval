observations of the general background and discrete
    sources of cosmic noise a survey of a broad strip of sky
    centred on declination has been made using an aerial with beam
    width to half power of previous results concerning the
    background distribution of brightness have been confirmed and
    discrete sources have been detected the distribution of these
    sources is shown no correlation was found between the
    occurrence of scintillations and published ionospheric data but
    the observations are consistent with an origin of
    scintillations in irregularities of dimensions about km at a
    height of about
