subject classification of fiction in the holon municipal
    library (in hebrew). former attempts to classify fiction
    concentrated on literary genres and one such attempt in the
    roskild, (denmark) library is briefly reviewed. the holon
    librarians decided to build a subject catalogue for fiction
    which can be readily used by readers as well as librarians. a
    basic list of subjects was drawn up and additional ones added
    as works of fiction were processed. it was found that some
    fiction cannot be classified by subject, while other works
    receive 2 or more subject cards. the classification was carried
    out in 2 stages; at first only books currently received were
    classified, and later the existing fiction collection was
    processed in the same fashion. the lists of subject headings in
    hebrew and english are appended.
