solar tides in the f region from the study of night time
    critical frequencies night time critical frequency variations
    at ionospheric stations are analysed by season and by latitude
    for semi diurnal solar tidal terms the amplitude and phase of
    the vertical drift velocity of electrons so found are
    consistent with accepted tidal theory and an estimate of the
    height gradient of the vertical drift is obtained two parallel
    analyses are made on the alternative assumptions that decay
    proceeds according to a recombination law or to an attachment
    law the low values found for the decay coefficients preclude
    any decision as to which of these two decay processes is
    actually operative
