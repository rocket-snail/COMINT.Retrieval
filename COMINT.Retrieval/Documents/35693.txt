an overmodulation effect in negative feedback valve
    amplifiers if the final stage of a multistage rc coupled
    feedback amplifier is driven into grid current through over
    loading there is a difference between the input levels at which
    grid current sets in and that at which it ceases the distortion
    caused by this effect is investigated measures to eliminate it
    are discussed but are not considered worth undertaking for
    multichannel carrier systems
