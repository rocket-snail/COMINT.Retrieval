selected aspects from the change of guidelines on stock
    expansion in libraries in the leipzig area. in 1975 the number
    of stock items per inhabitant in leipzig libraries was slightly
    below the national average, so plans for 1976-80 emphasised
    stock expansion. variable provision standards were calculated
    for central and branch libraries. statistical analysis of
    results for this period shows a large stock budget, so that in
    several areas the required levels of stock provision were
    reached or even exceeded. only some of the most densely
    populated areas fell below the requisite standards. other aims
    for 1976-80 were the expansion and qualitative improvement of
    stocks in the central library and the raising of periodical
    subscription charges. particular difficulty was experienced
    with stocks for rural libraries, especially for part-time
    branch libraries; guidelines for 1981-85 aim to improve this
    aspect of the service.
