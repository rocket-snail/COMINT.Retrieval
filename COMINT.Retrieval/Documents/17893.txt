progress in the theory of library coordination and
    cooperation in scandinavian countries. the beginning of
    cooperation and coordination in scandinavia in the sphere of
    librarianship, bibliography and information can be seen in the
    theoretical studies of the 1950s. it was then that the
    scandia-plan, an intergovernmental plan of coordinated
    acquisitions of foreign literature, was started. research into
    cooperation has developed along 3 main levels-national,
    scandinavian and international-and this approach is reflected
    in the research methods employed. mathematical methods are used
    in scandinavian studies and statistical mathematics are the
    norm on the international level. the scandinavian success in
    library cooperation deserves greater attention on the part of
    soviet librarians.
