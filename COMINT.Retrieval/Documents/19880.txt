the concept of instantaneous frequency discussion shows
    that this concept can properly be applied to the cases of
    demodulation by a linear discriminator and fm of a self
    oscillator by variation o a parameter of the circuit but its
    use in other cases such as calculation of the harmonic
    distortion of a simple tuned circuit leads to erroneous results
    this is demonstrated by rigorous calculation of the distortion
    introduced by an lgc circuit in the anode circuit of a pentode
    amplifying stage
