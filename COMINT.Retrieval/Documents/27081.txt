behaviour of the ionosphere at rome during the partial
    solar eclipse of june observed eclipse effects are compared
    with effects calculated on the assumption that the electrons
    are produced by photo ionization and removed by ionic
    recombination or attachment ot neutral atoms and molecules and
    that the ionizing radiation is distributed uniformly over the
    visible disk of the sun it is deduced that the electron loss
    rate is consistent with an ionic recombination process in the
    layer the attachment and recombination coefficients decrease
    with increasing height their variations during the eclipse are
    related to the vertical movements of the ionosphere seasonal
    variations between effects observed in a number of eclipses are
    explained in terms of different degrees of superposition of the
    and layers the existence of secondary minima of electron
    density is interpreted as indicating that a distinction must be
    drawn between the ionizing sun and the visible sun eclipse
    effects in the e layer are also discussed
