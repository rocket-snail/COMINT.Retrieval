a new microwave harmonic generator microwave power is
    used to maintain a very short mercury arc between a pool
    cathode and a tungsten wire anode with an estimated input power
    of a few watts at kmcs an output in excess of mw was obtained
    at kmcs a strong signal at kmcs was detected by a spectrum
    analyser placed close to the arc tube
