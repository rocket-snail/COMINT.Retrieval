visual display terminals-possible health hazards. the
    introduction of visual display terminals into workplaces has
    led to fears of dangers to health. alleged radiation hazards
    have not been supported by the national institute for
    occupational health and safety (canada) or the british post
    office. visual and general fatigue problems may be overcome by
    tests and correction of operators' eyesight, and correct
    distancing of screen and keyboard. the workplace must permit
    comfortable posture for the operator, who should have space to
    look past the terminal at a non-contrasting surface.
