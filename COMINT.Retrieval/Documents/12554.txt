the origin of the ionospheric irregularities responsible
    for radio star scintillations and spread f part the present
    state of knowledge about the irregularities responsible for
    radio star scintillations is summarized and the existing
    theories of the origin of these irregularities are discussed
    all of the suggestions are shown to be inadequate to explain
    the observed features of scintillations and spread f it is
    shown that any i nizing agent from outside the earths
    atmosphere is unlikely to be responsible for the ionospheric
    irregularities that cause radio star scintillations and that
    the mechanism for their production must be sought in the
    terrestrial atmosphere
