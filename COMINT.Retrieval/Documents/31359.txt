determination of the location of the ionospheric current
    system responsible for geomagnetic effects of solar flares the
    height of the flare current system is calculated by a method
    depending on the time of maximum intensity of a geomagnetic
    flare effect and the enhancement of electron density at the
    relevant level if the flare current system forms part of the
    current system its height is but if it is independent its
    height is about km
