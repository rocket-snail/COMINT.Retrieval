on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a medium
    with appreciable spatial dispersion brief description of a
    method more detailed then that of ginzburg of april in which
    expansions are obtained for direct and inverse dispersion it is
    shown that in cubic crystals inclusion of the spatial
    dispersion leads to a weak anisotropy of the index of
    refraction
