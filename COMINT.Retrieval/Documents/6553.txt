optimal starting values for newton-raphson calculation of
    sqrt(x) the problem of obtaining starting values for the
    newton-raphson calculation of sqrt(x) on a digital computer is
    considered. it is shown that the conventionally used best
    uniform approximations to sqrt(x) do not provide optimal
    starting values. the problem of obtaining optimal starting
    values. the problem of obtaining optimal starting values is
    stated, and several basic results are proved. a table of
    optimal polynomial starting values is given. july, 1967
