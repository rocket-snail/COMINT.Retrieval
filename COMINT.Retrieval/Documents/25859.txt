a differential input stage for low frequency amplifiers
    an ac coupled differential input stage is described in which
    the ratio of in phase to anti phase gain ie the transmission
    factor is theoretically infinite in an actual circuit the
    measured value of the transmission factor was at an in phase
    signal level of rms the frequency range of is adequate for most
    applications
