impedance and admittance surfaces three dimensional locus
    diagrams are used to investigate the variation of impedance and
    phase displacement in two pole circuits in response to
    variations of frequency resistance inductance or capacitance
    the impedance and admittance surfaces include straight lines
    corresponding to the important special case of zero phase
    displacement when the impedance is independent of the damping
    or detuning
