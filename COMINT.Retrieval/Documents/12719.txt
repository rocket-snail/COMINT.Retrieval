coherent spontaneous microwave emission by pulsed
    resonance excitation this paper describes an investigation of
    the coherent microwave emission from pulse excited ammonia
    molecules coherent and periodic pulses of near resonance
    frequency and duration excited the gas from its initial thermal
    condition self induced coherent emission molecular ringing
    continued after the excitation field was removed this radiation
    was observed during a period of in an actual experiment
    performed a new doppler bandwidth reduction method was used in
    the gas cell the observed spectral width of the ammonia line
    was about the emission was used to stabilize the excitation
    signal source to a short term frequency stability of
