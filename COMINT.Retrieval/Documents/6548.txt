library work with handicapped children in a branch
    library. the librarian at a branch library in potsdam works
    closely with teachers at the special school nearby, discussing
    suitable library material and arranging special events such as
    authors' visits. children from the lower forms are brought into
    the library to sample the books and learn about the library
    service; the children enjoy their visits and often return again
    during leisure hours. stocks most useful to them are large
    print books and pictorial material. the librarian has acquired
    a good knowledge of individual readers and their interests.
    through close cooperation with other libraries, handicapped
    readers from other areas often come to use this library. good
    contacts with parents are also valuable; a meeting is planned
    to introduce parents to literature on different kinds of
    handicap.
