the diffusion of ionized meteor trails in the upper
    atmosphere the variation with height of the duration of radio
    echoes from meteor trails is discussed for the experimental
    conditions involved echo duration decreases approximately
    exponentially with increased height in agreement with diffusion
    theory the diffusion coefficient is between and in agreement
    with estimates based on rocket determinations of upper air
    density
