a junction transistor tetrode for high frequency use
    application of suitable bias to a fourth electrode connected to
    the p type central section of an npn junction transistor causes
    a considerable reduction of the base resistance this reduction
    enables the transistor to be used at frequencies over ten times
    the normal limit circuits are given for a variable frequency
    tuned amplifier a band pass amplifier and a sine wave
    oscillator for
