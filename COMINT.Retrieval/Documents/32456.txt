annual reviews as indicators of the developing structure
    of scientific disciplines. (phd thesis-university of maryland.)
    examines the 2annual review of information science and
    technology1 from 1966-75, for evidence of the developing
    intellectual structure of the discipline of information
    science. this structure is viewed as being composed of the
    concepts which form the intellectual territory of the
    discipline and their organisation into topics research areas
    and sub-fields. a primary function of review literature is seen
    to be the mapping of the intellectual structure of the
    discipline. examines concepts underlying authors' natural
    language. attempts to produce a model of the life cycle of a
    scientific discipline, and suggests a number of follow-up
    studies.
