children's access to public library services' prince
    george's county memorial public library, maryland, 1980. a
    paper presented at the 41st conference of the graduate library
    school, university of chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access
    to services and materials in school and public libraries. in
    the history of public library services in the us, numberless
    regulations have been established to determine what kinds of
    service should be provided for children and what limitations
    should be placed on those services and on the use of materials
    in the library. as facilities for sharing information have
    grown, so have questions about children's access to such
    technological advances as data bases and to interlibrary loan
    programmes. in 1967, the american library association revised
    the 2library bill of rights1 to ensure that library use not be
    denied individuals because they are minors. little research has
    been done on how the intention of this action has been
    implemented or ignored. evaluates 1 library's approach to
    access for children, examining policies, regulations,
    practices, and coordinations that affect such access.
