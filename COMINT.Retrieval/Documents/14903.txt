ideological bias and books for children and adolescents
    in brazil. presents the conclusions of a paper given at a
    brazilian seminar on literature for children in 1978. 21
    children's books by brazilian authors were examined, and found
    to be composed according to a rigid predetermined structure
    based on a clear and absolute demarcation of good and evil,
    backed by an ideology legitimising the power of adults over
    children. draws a parallel with the subliterature of 19th
    century france, and postulates that brazilian children's
    literature is fundamentally a product of the prevailing social
    and economic order, reflecting in the depiction of the
    parent-child relationship the producer-consumer relationship of
    industrial society. the introduction of superficially
    contemporary material in language and physical detail does not
    affect the essentially reactionary character of such works, and
    this ideological rigidity explains their low literary
    quality.
