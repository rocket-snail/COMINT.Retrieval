spin rate of the satellite echo as determined bya
    tracking radar radar observation of echo indicate that between
    passes and the spin rate increased from to rev min between
    these two observations the satellite first started passing into
    the earths shadow which possibly resulted in changes in
    internal pressure and subsequent deformation of the
    baloon
