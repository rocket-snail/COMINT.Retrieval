the influence of the time dependent series resistance of
    a capacitance diode in a mavar up converter an amplifying
    frequency converter for conversion is investigated
    theoretically the variable reactance is a semiconductor diode
    of the type described by uhlir the effect of the loss
    resistance of this diode on converter stability and band width
    is evaluated
