diurnal and storm time variations of geomagnetic and
    ionospheric disturbance analysis of records obtained at abinger
    and slough during a period of months shows the diurnal
    variations to be very complex with significant differences
    dependent on season and on activity level the hr component is
    important in both geomagnetic and ionospheric phenomena but a
    component is found only in ionospheric f disturbance the storm
    time variations of f and of horizontal magnetic force h are
    statistically closely linked
