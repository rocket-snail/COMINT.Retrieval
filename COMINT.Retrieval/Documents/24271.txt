high speed counter uses ternary notation the basis of the
    counter is a flip flop circuit modified to have three stable
    states by insertion of a diode coupling circuit between the
    cathodes a nine stage circuit is described operating reliably
    up to counts of per sec the indicating system may use either
    one or two lights per stage
