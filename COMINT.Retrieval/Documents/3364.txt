amplitude stability in oscillating systems as a
    supplement to the kryloff and bogoliuboff method of determining
    amplitude of oscillation in quasilinear systems a method based
    upon energy balance is presented from the energy balance
    condition a criterion for stability of oscillation is deduced
    for the case of one degree of freedom the treatment is then
    generalized to systems of n degrees of freedom
