the drug research and development chemical information
    system of nci's developmental therapeutics program. the us
    national cancer institute's drug research and development
    chemical information system was developed to monitor the
    accession, storage, and distribution of chemicals and drugs for
    anti-tumour testing. it identifies duplicates and analogues of
    interest to the institute's developmental therapeutics program;
    produces action and information documents as required;
    maintains inventory control; and interfaces with the biology
    data processing system which evaluates and disseminates
    screening results. an on-line interactive retrieval subsystem
    permits substructure and full structure searching on a file of
    310,000 compounds. results of searching other data bases are
    linked with the system to identify compounds worthy of
    acquisition. an index of non-systematic names in 2chemical
    abstracts1, referenced to compounds in the system, is
    generated.
