gilding a golden glow. historical review and details of
    current practice in the art of edge gilding, based on the
    author's personal experience, with sections on preparation for
    gilding, gold leaves, glaire, burnishing, and mechanised
    gilding. mechanisation has meant that gilding books is now more
    widespread than ever, although hand crafting still remains a
    challenge, and the finished product is still appreciated by the
    bibliophile.
