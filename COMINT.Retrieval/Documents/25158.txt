a strategy for archiving government data to meet the
    needs of the research community. the government is the greatest
    collector and user of information. statistics canada has
    identified 2,352 major government data banks in canada. in
    response to a growing recognition that government has gone too
    far in its data collection activities, it is trying to reduce
    its 'paperburden'. perhaps one solution is to institute a
    rational and consistent strategy for archiving these government
    data, but still meet the needs of the research community.
    suggests that the canadian government must establish the
    information over which it has ownership and the condition of
    such ownership; no government record may be destroyed or
    altered without consent from the dominion archivist or his
    designate; and the dominion archivist must have the right to
    declare any government record or copy thereof an archival
    record.
