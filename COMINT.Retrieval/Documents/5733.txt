wide band if amplifiers bandwidths such as are required
    for dealing satisfactorily with very short pulses are achieved
    without necessitating alignment of the amplifier with a
    particular set of valves by using a negative feedback design
    technique the amplifier is treated as a series of pairs of
    valves the first of each pair operating without and the second
    with feedback a table gives component values in a form
    requiring a minimum of computation a particular stage amplifier
    designed by this method for a centre frequency of had a
    bandwidth of to the points and an overall gain of about the
    response varied only very slightly when all the valves were
    changed
