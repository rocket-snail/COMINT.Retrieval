some aspects of the logical and circuit design of a
    digital field computer a new type of digital computer for the
    solution of field problems is described by making calculations
    at all the lattice points of the field simultaneously
    computation time is greatly reduced an experimental design of a
    basic unit for potential and other problems is presented
