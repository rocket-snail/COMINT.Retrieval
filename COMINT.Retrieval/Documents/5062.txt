library provision of music-a question of priorities.
    discusses the teaching of music librarianship in the danish
    library school. mentions a swedish protest letter against the
    proposed abolition of such teaching. although abolition is not
    suggested in denmark, much in the letter is applicable to
    danish conditions. it thus points out that libraries with their
    non-commercial objectives can counteract the predominance of
    large foreign record companies. it argues that now that music
    departments in libraries are being reduced, librarians should
    receive more instruction in music librarianship so that they
    can make better use of the limited resources. now when the
    training is to be revised, the opportunity should be grasped to
    give music a higher priority in the library school.
