the impact of prestel on public library reference
    activities. describes a project aimed to assess the impact of
    prestel on public library reference services from the viewpoint
    of users and library staff, as well as considering the
    management implications such as stock acquisition, budget and
    space use. prestel and teletext receivers were installed for 12
    months in reference libraries in the london boroughs of bexley,
    hounslow, sutton and waltham forest and in birmingham and
    norwich central reference libraries. prestel was found to be a
    useful supplement to existing resources for statistical,
    business, news and leisure information but the study indicated
    factors inhibiting use which precluded more experimental use
    and a more thorough testing of their application in reference
    libraries.
