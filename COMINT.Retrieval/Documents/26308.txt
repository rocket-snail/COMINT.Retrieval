professional ethics. critique of the draft code on
    professional ethics produced by the library association. the
    code is badly written, confused, silly, contradictory and
    threatens to bring the la into disrepute. notes provide little
    illumination; codes of ethics do not per se bring
    professionalism; a librarian's primary duty is often to a
    corporate body; there is confusion about possible conflicts in
    service; and the library association is impudent in suggesting
    that it will impose sanctions on those who fail to keep abreast
    of developments in librarianship. suggests that the working
    party would do well to refer to the american library
    association code.
