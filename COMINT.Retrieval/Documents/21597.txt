children's libraries in nigeria. lecture given at the
    ifla/unesco seminar in leipzig, aug 81. general conditions are
    illustrated by a description of children's libraries in bendel
    province, where children's departments in public libraries and
    school libraries have been established since the 1970s.
    reference departments in large libraries also stock some
    material for children. library staff organise reading sessions,
    films, dancing and artistic activities and hope to develop
    these further and to expand readership. bendel's school library
    service is administered by a centre in charge of all purchasing
    and loans. short training courses are organised for
    teacher-librarians and public library assistants also help in
    the school libraries.
