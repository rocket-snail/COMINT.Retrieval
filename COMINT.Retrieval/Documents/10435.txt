an input amplifier for a pulse height analyser the
    analyser described can be gated by pulses coincident with the
    pulses to be measured the error introduced being of the maximum
    output pulse height variation of the input amplification
    enables the scale to be expanded for detailed examination of
    part of a spectrum
