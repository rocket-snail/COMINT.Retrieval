variable and reversible magnetic fields obtained from a
    permanent magnet a permanent magnet forms the core of a
    cylinder whose surface is made of two armco iron shoes and two
    brass shoes rotation of the cylinder directs the flux either to
    a shunt or across the gap of the magnet for deflection of an
    atomic beam
