linear transmission of pulses at centimetre wavelengths
    analysis for the transmission of pulses of arbitrary shape by
    waveguide and cavity resonator systems is based on use of
    laplace transforms using theory presented previously a
    calculation is made of the transfer function for a system of
    weakly coupled cavity resonators
