backscattering of kilovolt electrons from solids the
    total number and energy distribution of backscattered electrons
    with incident electrons of energy have been measured for and
    using retarding potential technique the dependence on the
    energy of the incident electrons is characteristically
    different for elements of atomic number above and below the
    ratio fo the mean energy of the backscattered electrons to that
    of the incident electrons is about for and increases only
    slightly with atomic number the results are interpreted as
    indicating the inelastic processes are predominant in the
    scattering of medium energy electrons
