distribution of sc of magnetic storms the abbreviation sc
    is used to denote the reverse impulse preceding a sudden
    commencement the distribution with respect to local tim and
    latitude was examined from records obtained at five us stations
    during a period of years and also from world wide records of
    individual geomagnetic storms the reverse impulses appear
    chiefly in the afternoon with a maximum at about local time the
    pulse magnitude as well as its ratio to the succeeding main
    pulse increases markedly with geomagnetic latitude
