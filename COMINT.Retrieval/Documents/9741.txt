dielectric dispersion in pure polar liquids at very high
    radio frequencies part the effect of electrolytes in solution a
    description is given of measurements at mm and cm wavelengths
    of the absorption of electrolytic solutions of concentrations
    up to water and methyl alcohol being used as solvents the
    results obtained are analysed in terms of debyes theory of
    dispersion in a polar dielectric and modifications of the
    theory necessary to take account of the ionic conductivity of
    an electrolyte are indicated measurements on aqueous solutions
    of are discussed in relation to huckels theory of electrolytic
    solutions
