library binding as a conservation measure. examines the
    problem of how librarians can choose suitable bindings for
    books meant for permanent retention in the archival collection.
    discusses' the main features of different types of commercial
    binding currently available; binding different categories of
    material; special binding options which binders can offer their
    customers; examining volumes on their return from binding; and
    in-house binding options. concludes that library binding can be
    a conservation measure to extend the life of the volume and
    conserve it if methods are sensibly selected and applied, and
    indicates the most acceptable methods from a conservation
    viewpoint.
