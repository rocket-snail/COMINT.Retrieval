gain stability of feedback amplifiers by proper choice of
    the phase single of the loop gain either the magnitude or the
    phase angle of the amplifier gain may be made independent to a
    first order of changes in the active elements th general theory
    is developed results obtained with an experimental amplifier
    show that over a narrow frequency range the unit can be made as
    stable as the passive components in the feedback network
