a ferrite microwave modulator employing feedback an
    amplitude modulator with good linearity is obtained by applying
    feedback to a gyrator comprising a ferrite rod in a circular
    waveguide section interposed between rectangular waveguide
    sections the feedback circuit is based on linear detection of
    the amplitude modulation by means of a crystal limitations of
    the arrangement are discussed good results have been obtained
    with sinusoidal modulating signals of frequencies up to
