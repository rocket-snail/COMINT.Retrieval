a view from zambia. contribution to a section devoted to
    planning interlending systems for developing countries. in
    zambia, acquisitions are centralised, which can lead to
    unsuitable selection for local libraries. the national library
    receives most funds, while other libraries suffer, and there
    are few good bookshops. interlending is focused on the national
    university library, and attempts to create a national union
    catalogue have failed so far. demand for books is high, but
    librarians' status is low. interlending could be based on
    existing research collections, but a central collection of
    journals would be costly and premature.
