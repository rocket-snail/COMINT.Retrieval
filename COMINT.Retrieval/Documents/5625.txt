pulse formation and supply for magnetrons discussion of
    the design of a modulator capable of handling pulses of the
    order of at wit a duration of an a repetition rate of per sec
    the method of pulse formation used is based on the slow
    charging of a capacitor the use of artifical lines for pulse
    shaping is described if a pulse transformer is used the
    charging voltage need not be unduly high
