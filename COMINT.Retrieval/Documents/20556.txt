the theory and design of gas discharge microwave
    attenuators the theory of the interaction between a dc gas
    discharge and an rf field is considered and expressions
    developed for the complex conductivity of the discharge the
    simple lorentz theory is shown to give values of complex
    conductivity not very different from those derived with more
    detailed analyses problems connected with the gas discharge
    including that of noise production are considered practical
    microwave attenuators developed by the authors are described in
    detail two main classes of device are considered devices with
    resonant structures and distributed devices
