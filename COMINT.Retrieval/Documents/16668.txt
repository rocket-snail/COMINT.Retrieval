some comments on the curriculum of the basic branch of
    study-library science, intramural study. the intramural course
    of study at the humboldt university in berlin leading to a
    degree in library science provides future librarians with
    scientifically based knowledge and good practical career
    training. a student follows courses in subjects related to
    library science, marxism and leninism, and foreign languages,
    russian, english and french. several practical work periods
    spent in different public and research libraries make up part
    of the course. librarian students also attend courses in
    subjects such as information science, technology and modern
    media to enable them to follow future developments in these
    fields affecting the library system. the course of study lasts
    8 terms, the last of which is spent in a library doing
    practical work and researching for a thesis for the final
    examination. the title awarded to librarians on passing the
    finals is diplombibliothekar (diploma librarian). the co urse
    also tries to stimulate students to independent study while at
    university and to expand their knowledge continuously in their
    future careers.
