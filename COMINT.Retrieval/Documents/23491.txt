application of information theory to the design of
    line-scan imaging systems. information theory is used to
    formulate a single figure of merit for assessing the
    performance of line scan imaging systems as a function of their
    spatial response (point spread function or modulation transfer
    function), sensitivity, sampling and quantization intervals,
    and the statistical properties of a random radiance
    field.
