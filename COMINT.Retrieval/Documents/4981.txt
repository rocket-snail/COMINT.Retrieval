designing tunnel diode circuits using composite
    characteristics with tunnel diodes connected in series certain
    relations between their peak and valley currents and their
    final voltages can be satisfied so that the composite curve has
    peaks valleys and stable positive regions the use of this type
    of characteristic for binary addition scaling and encoding is
    described
