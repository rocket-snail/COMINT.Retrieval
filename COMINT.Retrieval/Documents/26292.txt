velocity analysis of thermionic emission from single
    crystal tungsten the energy distribution of electrons emitted
    in various directions from the w filament was analysed using a
    special tube in which the electron trajectories were bent by a
    magnetic field the observed distributions were the same for all
    directions ad were not maxwellian variations of true work
    function over the temperature range were measured for several
    crystallographic directions the results are discussed in
    relation to values of the richardson emission constant found by
    other workers
