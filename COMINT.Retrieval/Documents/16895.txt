calculation of charge density distribution of multilayers
    from transit time data a method is discussed for calculating
    the electron density distribution in the ionosphere from data
    obtained using a rocket borne variable frequency transmitter or
    pulse reflections from higher layers it is not possible to
    obtain a solution free from ambiguity
