automation of the czechoslovak statewide scientific and
    technical information system. the czechoslovak scientific and
    technical information system was automated in 1972, and
    includes the processing of several data bases, interbranch
    information stocks, and factographical information retrieval
    systems. the idea of computerisation combines the principles of
    centralisation and decentralisation of information processes on
    the basis of standardisation of methods and technology, as well
    as of software and hardware. further automation will cover
    statewide telenets, terminal device and minicomputers, the
    creation of some on-line information retrieval services of
    retro type, and the integration of scientific and technical
    information systems with departmental automated control
    systems.
