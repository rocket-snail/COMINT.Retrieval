promoting in-service training in public libraries.
    following recommendations to the nederlands bibliotheek en
    lektuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and literature) for
    a scheme of in-service training for dutch librarians the nblc
    in 1977 created a department to promote the acquisition of
    professional expertise by practising librarians. the department
    offers courses on subjects such as the handling of audio-visual
    materials, automation in public libraries, children's story
    hours, and cataloguing. the courses are given by nblc staff
    with the help of practising librarians and library school
    lecturers and last from 5 to 10 days. in order to relate the
    syllabus to practical library situations students' practical
    experiences are used as far as possible to illustrate the
    theoretical aspects of the courses. the nblc plans to form a
    committee to examine the further development of in-service
    training for librarians.
