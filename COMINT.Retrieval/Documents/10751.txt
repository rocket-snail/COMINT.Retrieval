gating multipliers analogue computing equipment on lines
    proposed by goldberg of is described economy of materials is
    achieved by careful design of the switching circuit and by
    neutralization of the parasitic capacitances of the valves an
    accuracy to within one part in at a mean gating frequency of i
    is obtained
