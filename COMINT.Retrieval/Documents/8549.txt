the diffraction of a dipole field by a perfectly
    conducting half plane a method of analysis is developed which
    is valid for any orientation of the dipole the dipole field is
    resolved into plane waves whose diffraction can be studied
    independently the particular case of an electric dipole with
    its axis normal to the half plane is investigated
