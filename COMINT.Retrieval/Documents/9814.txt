a method of analysis of fundamental and overtone crystal
    oscillator circuits use of the method of loci facilitates
    comparison between the pierce miller and the pierce colpitts
    type of crystal oscillator circuit type is much more suitable
    for harmonic oscillation and very high frequencies because it
    requires less mutual conductance type is under certain
    conditions particularly suitable for frequency standards
    circuits with the crystal connected between anode and cathode
    have under certain conditions low power dissipation in the
    crystal conditions for frequency stability are analysed and a
    simple and accurate method of determining crystal parameters is
    described
