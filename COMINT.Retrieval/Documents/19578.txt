the public library and social demand in brazil. a paper
    delivered at a 1978 brazilian conference discussing the failure
    of public libraries to become an accepted community
    institution. considers their actual state at present' housed in
    substandard buildings, under-resourced, staffed by untrained
    personnel, and used mainly by students. the imported model of
    the public library serving the needs of all the community is
    inappropriate to the social reality in brazil, where social
    structure is based on class division. statistics are presented
    to show the extent of potential demand, but despite recent
    expansion of services, and the growth of publishing, the
    population of non-users remains constant, and reading continues
    to be an elite leisure activity. the initiation of a cultural
    policy to break the chains of social dependence and develop
    plans for society as a whole is advocated.
