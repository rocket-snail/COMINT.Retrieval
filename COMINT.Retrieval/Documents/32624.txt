cataloguing machine-readable data files' an introduction.
    due to lack of bibliographic control and unfamiliarity,
    machine-readable data files (mrdfs) remain phantom material to
    both librarians and library users-even though more and more
    research materials are being produced in machine-readable form.
    reviews the current status of mrdfs; discusses basic conditions
    for cataloguing mrdfs; explains how a computer is operated and
    how mrdfs are produced; and reviews chapter 9 of the
    anglo-american cataloguing rules (2nd edition) which is devoted
    to descriptive cataloguing rules for mrdfs, focusing on
    troublesome areas.
