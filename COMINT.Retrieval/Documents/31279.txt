a method of reducing the time lag of transducers which
    have an exponential response the response of a transducer such
    as a thermocouple is corrected for phase and amplitude by
    adding its output voltage to its amplified derivative details
    of a drift corrected dc amplifier and highly stable power
    supply are given
