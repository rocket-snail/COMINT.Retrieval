the logical principles of a new kind of binary counter
    auxiliary temporary storage in a binary counter is provided
    during intervals over which the main storage element is in
    state of change by elements having the same time indefiniteness
    as the main storage elements this leads to a device which has
    true and false ranks of storage elements the basic device is
    generalized to one with four modes of operation and the rules
    of number formation are discussed application to a computer is
    described
