experimental study of anomalous electron stream behaviour
    experimental measurements on the characteristics of the sole
    current in a rectilinear crossed fil field beam are reported
    the sole current may be assigned a kinetic temperature of the
    order of corresponding to energy in excess of that
    corresponding to motion in static fields the energy exchange
    leading to this excess energy exchange leading to this excess
    energy is believed to be associated with multiple loop
    trajectories in the low potential region near the
    cathode
