a long way to equality for the handicapped. report on the
    5th nordic summer school for librarians, held in norway on 22
    july-7 aug 81 with the theme: 'library service to handicapped
    readers'. the following subjects were dealt with' problems
    connected with reading; the special problems of particular
    groups; materials; technical aids; provision in libraries; and
    cooperation between school and public libraries. the situation
    in the different nordic countries was compared. the standard of
    reading needed for society is likely to increase, thus
    distancing the handicapped further from the normal population.
    the special problems of the deaf, the mentally ill, the
    aphasics, the blind, and the mentally retarded were discussed.
    materials to handicapped readers were described on the basis of
    an analysis of the reading skill, the definition of an easy
    text, and the different needs of the variously handicapped. the
    need to create a barrier-free library by good planning and
    design was emphasised.
