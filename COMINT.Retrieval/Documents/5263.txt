the common collector transistor amplifier at carrier
    frequencies formulae are derived for th af operating parameters
    of the grounded collector common collector circuit the
    variation of the transistor current amplification factor with
    frequency is investigated the effect of operating conditions on
    the cut off frequency ie the frequency ie the frequency at
    which drops to of its af value is discussed modified formulae
    are hence derived which are valid up to about experimental
    results support the theory presented point contact npn junction
    and early pnp alloy transistors were studied
