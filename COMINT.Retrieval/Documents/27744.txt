an outline of the development of the senckenberg library
    in frankfurt-am-main. the library is part of a foundation
    established in 1763 by dr. johann christian senckenberg. in the
    19th century, several learned societies amalgamated their
    libraries with it; the stocks, comprising works in natural
    sciences and medicine, were available for use by local doctors
    and members of the newly formed association. in 1907 the
    library was opened to the public; new premises were used and
    professional staff employed. after a period of financial
    difficulty during world war i, the johann-wolfgang-goethe
    university took over financial control of the library. in 1947
    a new agreement was made, giving the university more powers in
    library administration and in 1966 the library was moved into
    new premises with the university library.
