image parameters of filters with one or two cut off
    frequencies and notes on the decomposition of the transfer
    coefficient a table is given of formulae for the image transfer
    coefficients and image impedances of high pass band pass and
    band stop filters methods of expressing the transfer
    coefficients as the sum of the transfer coefficients of the
    basic sections are explained though the band stop case cannot
    be included the filters are considered to be without loss and
    without mutual inductance
