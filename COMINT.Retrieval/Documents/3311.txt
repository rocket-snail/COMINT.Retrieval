a babel of concrete. reports on a conference on library
    service to immigrants organised by the danish library
    association, mar 81, and held in ishoj, which has denmark's
    largest concentration of immigrants with 50 different languages
    spoken by a population of 21,000. the mayor of ishoj argued
    that immigrants must assimilate and learn danish, whereas the 3
    immigrant spokesman claimed that children must learn their
    mother tongue properly before they can learn danish, if they
    are not to be culturally isolated, knowing 2 languages only
    partly. book provision was 6 books per dane, but only 1/2 per
    immigrant. the librarians present pointed out the enormity of
    the problem of library provision to immigrants speaking so many
    different languages, and asked for more bilingual librarians
    and closer contact with schools on matters of linguistic
    background and book selection.
