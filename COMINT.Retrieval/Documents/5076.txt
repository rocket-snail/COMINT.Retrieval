the adjustment of control systems for quick transien
    response a theoretical investigation indicates that for a large
    class of linear systems the error due to a transient
    disturbance is dependent on only one system parameter the
    settling time constant and that the quickest approach to
    correction is obtained when the system is adjusted so as to be
    quasicritically damped the adoption of quasicritical damping as
    a design criterion for stability is recommended
