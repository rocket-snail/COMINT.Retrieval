on the expected lengths of sequences generated in sorting
    by replacement selecting in the replacement-selecting technique
    of sorting, one is interested in the ratio l(j) of the expected
    length of the j-th sequence generated by the technique to the
    number of memory cells used. using complex-variable theory, it
    is shown that l(j) -> 2 and that, asymptotically, the
    average interval between sign changes of l(j)-2 is 2.6662.
