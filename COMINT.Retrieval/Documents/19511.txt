local electron densities deduced from the faraday fading
    of satellite transmissions using measurements during two
    consecutive transits in the analysis it is assumed that during
    the period of revolution of the satellite the relative
    gradients of the local electron density are constant at he same
    altitudes and the changes in density above the maximum are the
    same as those within the f layer daytime observations of in
    september have been analysed
