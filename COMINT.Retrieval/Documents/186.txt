a library is for the public. us public libraries
    represent the ideal (goals which are always being pursued) and
    the real (practices which must be followed lest nihilism
    result). practicality has revealed that public libraries are
    for all people, including the handicapped and those of all
    races. this has resulted in the adjustment of libraries for the
    accommodation of all, the expansion of services within the
    library, and the extension of the library's facilities outside
    its building. in this way, the real is realised and the ideal
    is still pursued.
