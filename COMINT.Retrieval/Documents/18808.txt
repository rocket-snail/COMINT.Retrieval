    services available to the handicapped in europe, the u.s.a.,
    and canada, excluding quebec. details are given of the
    historical background, legislation, and notable public and
    private ventures. the discussion is divided into sections,
    dealing respectively with hospital services, domiciliary
    services, and services for the visually handicapped, the
    mentally handicapped, and the deaf. the survey leads to the
    conclusion that the mentally handicapped and the deaf are the
    most neglected groups. the importance of public library
    initiatives, especially in the u.s.a. and canada, is
    emphasised, in relation to the development of services in
    quebec, where librarians are not prepared to respond to the
    needs of the handicapped.
