computer-aided spectral identification of laser-induced
    plasma emmission. the analysis of the electronic emission
    spectra produced by a laser-induced plasma may be performed by
    computer analysis. presents 2 algorithms for matching such
    spectra against standard tables. the relative efficiencies of
    the 2 algorithms are analysed.
