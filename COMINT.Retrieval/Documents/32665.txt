acceleration of electrons by an external force field the
    usual proof that an electron in an energy band reacts to an
    external force as though it had an effective mass is shown to
    be invalid it is shown however that for static externally
    applied fields modified energy bands can be found for which the
    acceleration theorem is rigorously correct
