metropolitan public library funding and intergovernmental
    fiscal relations' concepts and issues. competition among the
    many public services for tax supported funding is a major
    concern for metropolitan public libraries seeking financial
    support. problems in library financing are interwoven through
    the fabric of issues fundamental to u.s. economic and political
    life and cannot be solved without understanding their
    complexities. the social and economic growth patterns of
    metropolitan areas as opposed to their actual legal tax raising
    boundaries are a critical factor. report not available from
