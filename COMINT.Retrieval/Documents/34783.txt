books for the handicapped, for example in a library. in
    the international year of the disabled, this librarian arranged
    an author's reading of a book on handicap and book displays for
    young children and teenagers, complemented by selective book
    indexes and information on local facilities for the
    handicapped. 2 indexes were produced, 1 directed at teachers
    and parents, for primary school age children and another for
    children from 10 years upwards. it was important to establish
    correct selection criteria so as to present material that would
    help normal children to overcome their fear of handicapped
    people and to come nearer to understanding their problems.
    material sources included the library catalogue and indexes
    produced by the deutsche lesegesellschaft (german readers'
    society).
