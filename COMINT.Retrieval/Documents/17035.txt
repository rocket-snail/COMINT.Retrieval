a gloomy outlook for libraries?. public library
    development has halted at a point when, because of the
    recession, library services are particularly necessary. current
    economic measures have hit libraries hard. some people now
    regard information as merchandise for which a suitable market
    price must be obtained; this increases the risk of information
    services being taken over by private companies, which could
    lead to reductions in state budgets. the rapid development of
    information technology threatens to bypass the library service
    and because of the competitive situation on the information
    market libraries are being asked to restrict themselves to
    their traditional tasks. libraries must mobilise reserves
    hitherto unused; refusing to implement new methods of
    literature provision could have disastrous consequences.
    initial organisational problems can be overcome through
    rationalisation, centralisation and wider use of electronic
    data processing.
