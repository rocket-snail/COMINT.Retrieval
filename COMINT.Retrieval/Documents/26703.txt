flexural vibrations in mechanical filters matrix methods
    are used for calculating the characteristics of flexural
    vibrations in rods and the results are compared with those
    measured by an experimental method described the design of
    mechanical filters with torsional and longitudinal vibrations
    and free from flexural waves is discussed
