the librarian's life, scholarship and librarianship. (the
    janet doe lecture on the history or philosophy of medical
    librarianship, presented june 17, 1980 at the 80th annual
    meeting of the medical library association, washington, d.c.)
    if librarians are to understand their role and participate in
    the life of scholarship, they must be more than record
    custodians or information service managers. there are many
    approaches to this understanding including the historical,
    social, psychological and epistemological. it can also be
    sought through a study of the sociology of knowledge and a
    study of the ways in which changes in communications technology
    in writing and printing have affected scholarship in the past.
    this may also provide a means of preparing for the impact of
    computer technology on the scholarship of the future.
