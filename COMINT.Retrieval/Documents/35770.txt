charge and discharge of a nonlinear condenser through a
    linear nondissipative inductance has shown that for a capacitor
    with a semiconductor as dielectric the capacitance is
    proportional to where is the voltage across the capacitor and
    is the voltage across the capacitor and is a constant a circuit
    is analysed in which such a capacitor is connected in series
    with a lossless inductance and a direct voltage source and a
    comparison is made with an exponential capacitor exp
    applications to the generation of rectangular and triangular
    waveforms are indicated see also of evaluating base materials

    losses of base materials used for printed circuits which affect
