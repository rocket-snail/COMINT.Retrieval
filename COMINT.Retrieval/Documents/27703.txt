abolition of charges for public libraries: yes or no?'
    the opinions of local councillors. text of a discussion with
    councillors involved in the provision of public library
    services in 3 local authorities in the netherlands. the
    councillor from rijswijk, where charges for public library
    membership were abolished on 1 jan 74, pointed out that the
    number of registered borrowers had risen from 12,907 in 1973 to
    21,183 in 1974. however, the growth in membership figures had
    led to increased pressure on the existing services with the
    result that it had become necessary to reduce library opening
    hours from 47 1/2 hours to 29 1/2 hours per week. the uithoorn
    and heerhugowaard councillors defended the policy of their
    local councils in maintaining charges on the grounds that they
    were not excessive.
