on finnish library architecture. the author is of the
    opinion that the ground floor is the most important area of any
    library building, and it should not be used for secondary
    activities. in jyvaskyla library building, as in many finnish
    library buildings, the actual library is accommodated above the
    ground floor level. a competition for a design is normally
    organized. this was also the case in jyvaskyla. this is not the
    way to get best results, because the cooperation between the
    architect and the librarian only begins after the design is
    complete. an architect should be chosen carefully and the
    librarian or a library expert and the architect should
    cooperate throughout the design of the building.
