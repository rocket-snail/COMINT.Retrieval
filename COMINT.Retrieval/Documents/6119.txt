some dynamic problems of flight to the moon trajectories
    for reaching the moon or for flying round the moon and
    returning to the earth are considered the initial rocket
    velocities and the distances from the earth and moon of four
    different orbits are tabulated a periodic orbit passing near
    the moon and earth seems to be impractical because an error in
    the initial velocity of mm sec would be enough to allow the
    rocket to escape into space after only four revolutions for a
    shorter account see
