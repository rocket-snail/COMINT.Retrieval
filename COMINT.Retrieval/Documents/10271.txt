radio reflections from aurorae part observations made
    with a meteor survey apparatus confirm the conclusions drawn
    previously of january the mean velocity of the reflecting
    regions changes from westwards at with diffuse echoes to
    eastwards with discrete echoes there is a diurnal minimum of
    echo frequency between and when the reflecting regions appear
    to be at rest and echoes are absent from to ut correlation is
    observed between the radio echoes the occurrence of visual
    aurorae and magnetic activity
