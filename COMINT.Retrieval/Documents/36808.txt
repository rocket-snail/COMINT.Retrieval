radio reflections from aurorae analysis of auroral echoes
    observed at jodrell bank indicates echoes are due to direct
    nonspecular reflection from an auroral arc extending more than
    along a parallel of geomagnetic latitude reflection occurs in a
    region of limited vertical extent at a height of about observed
    movements of intense reflecting centres represent the motion of
    an ionizing agent rather than a mass movement of ionized
    gas
