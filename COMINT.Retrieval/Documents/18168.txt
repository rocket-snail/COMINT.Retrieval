faculty papers and special-subject repositories. the
    growth of college and university archives and the proliferation
    of repositories collecting documents on specific subjects, have
    created a complex situation regarding the disposition of papers
    of college and university faculty members. hence papers by
    faculty members working in fields for which special-subject
    archives exist may be sought by 2 or more competing
    institutions. suggests ways in which special-subject archives
    can cooperate and work towards ways of solving some of the
    problems.
