the direct voltage valve amplifier effects of valve and
    circuit noise fluctuations of the current source and
    temperature changes are evaluated a review of basic amplifier
    circuits for measurement purposes illustrates different
    directly coupled interstage and output arrangements and methods
    of compensating the above effects methods of amplification
    involving modulation are noted
