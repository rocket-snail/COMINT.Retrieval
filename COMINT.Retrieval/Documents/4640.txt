evidence of harmonics in the spectrum of a solar radio
    outburst measurements of rf outbursts on november and may show
    a dynamic spectrum comprising two widely spaced frequency bands
    having a drift with time from high to low frequencies the ratio
    between frequencies of corresponding peaks was close enough to
    to suggest a harmonic relation between the bands the emission
    may take place in the corona at frequencies equal to the
    natural plasma frequency and its harmonics
