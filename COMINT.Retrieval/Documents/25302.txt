reference services to children and students in the public
    library. considers the service rendered by the bloemfontein
    public library south africa. the reasons why pupils in the
    11-16 years age group used the library as a source of
    information are given as determined through a survey. students
    were not similarly surveyed but impressions of their library
    use are given. attention is given to the capabilities required
    of librarians serving these 2 groups, and to methods of
    developing these capabilities. sources of information must
    provide many levels of entry to information to cater for
    children at different levels of education. because of swift
    advancements in the education of black children, south african
    public libraries can expect great strains in the 1980s in
    providing the required reference services.
