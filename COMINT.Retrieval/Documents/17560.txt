effect of crystalline electric fields on ferromagnetic
    anisotropy the effect of the electrostatic crystalline field
    has been considered for a magnetic crystal in which the ions
    are strongly coupled by ferromagnetic exchange on the basis of
    the one ion approximation that the exchange can be represented
    by a weiss molecular field expressions for the anisotropy
    constants have been derived the treatment assumes that the
    magnetic electrons can be considered as localized on the
    individual ions and thus applies primarily to nonmetallic
    substances such as ferrites
