the relativistic flow of electrons in parallel and radial
    straight lines with no externally imposed magnetic field
    analysis is given of the possibility of producing relativistic
    electron flows it is shown that they could not start from a
    cathode surface where the electrons have zero speed the
    analysis also applies to flows normally considered
    nonrelativistic in diodes where the linear dimensions of the
    electrode surfaces are large compared with the electrode
    spacing of
