an analytical approach for studying corporate entry in
    cataloging. (phd thesis-case western reserve university.) all
    entries in a month's input into the us national union catalog
    were analysed and the corporate body entries were analysed in
    greater detail, with emphasis on the application of aacr 1 and
    aacr 2. discusses the information thus obtained and concludes
    that the investigation showed that the catalogue itself should
    be used as the basis for further experiments on solving
    cataloguing problems.
