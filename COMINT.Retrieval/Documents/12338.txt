propagation measurements in the ionosphere with the aid
    of rockets measurements made at white sands are reported
    continuous waves with harmonically related frequencies namely
    and were radiated from the rocket to two ground stations the
    higher frequency wave is practically unaffected by the e layer
    and serves as a reference the ordinary and extraordinary
    components of the lower frequency wave with frequency
    multiplied by re separately heterodyned with the reference wave
    the refractive indices of the medium are determined from the
    resulting beat frequencies together with a determination of the
    geomagnetic field and of the electron collision frequency at
    one altitude the lorentz polarization term can be neglected
    results are given and discussed
