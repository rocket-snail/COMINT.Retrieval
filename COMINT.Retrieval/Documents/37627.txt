long range radio echoes from auroral ionization echoes
    believed to be from auroral ionization are consistently
    observed using pulse signals on frequencies and at the
    relatively low latitude of stanford california two types of
    echo are distinguished discrete of very large amplitude and
    diffuse of much smaller amplitude echo data show a marked
    correlation with visual aurorae and with magnetic activity and
    also indicate that reflections occur at regions well above the
    e layer
