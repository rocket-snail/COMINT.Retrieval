abnormal amplitude of seasonal effects in the ionosphere
    at the equator and structure of the upper atmosphere d layer
    absorption maximum ionization and structure of the layer have
    been studied seasonal variations observed in equatorial regions
    are much greater than expected from the geometrical variation
    of the suns position known theories assume simple variation of
    ionosphere parameters with cos the deviations observed are
    interpreted as indicating seasonal variations of the structure
    of the upper atmosphere particularly as regards temperature and
    its gradient molecular dissociation and movements of air masses
    at an equatorial station at the solstices not only is the solar
    radiation incident at an angle but the structure of the upper
    atmosphere is that appropriate ot a latitude of about
