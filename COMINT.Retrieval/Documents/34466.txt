investigations of the characteristics of bi stable
    multivibrators the characteristics are discussed theoretically
    with reference to the design of reliable counting and switching
    units design procedure is illustrated by two numerical examples
    one of a binary counting unit with counting rate up to at
    supply voltages between the other for a pulse counting rate at
    supply voltages between and a modification of the latter
    circuit using a double triode instead of was used at counting
    rates up to
