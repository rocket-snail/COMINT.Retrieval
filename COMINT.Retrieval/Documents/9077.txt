save! that means again fewer books. the library
    inspectorate has examined public library accounts for 1981.
    these show an overall increase well within the savings
    circular's limit of 2% real growth. because of book price
    rises, acquisitions are likely to show an overall fall of 4%.
    the savings circular urged libraries to spend not more than 185
    kr. per inhabitant. it is difficult to determine what effect
    this statement has had, but a closer examination shows that the
    highest spenders, all in the copenhagen area, have cut down
    most. in the rest of the country part-time libraries show
    larger percentage increases than full-time libraries. only the
    southern jutland region show a considerable real increase in
    expenditure on materials. as staff salaries are subject to
    topping up if necessary, these do not suffer as much from cuts
    as material expenditure, and the prospect is one of libraries
    with outdated and worn books.
