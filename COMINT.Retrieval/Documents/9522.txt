new horizons in library development in the rsfsr. summing
    up the work of librarianship in the last 5-year plan, and
    looking forward to the next, it is possible to discern 6 main
    areas of library activity' the completion of centralisation;
    the further improvement of library networks; the rational
    exploitation of stocks; the better training of library staff;
    improving the material and technological base of libraries; and
    developing work with readers. it is necessary to set specific
    goals for the new 5-year plan and to draw on past experience to
    help achieve them.
