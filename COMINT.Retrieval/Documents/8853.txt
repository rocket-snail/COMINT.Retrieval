diffraction of waves by a wedge greens functions of the
    wave equation for a wedge are given in the form of an integral
    representation for the two dimensional case and are evaluated
    by the residue theorem the half plane is considered as the
    limiting case of a wedge with angle the analysis is extended to
    the three dimensional case
