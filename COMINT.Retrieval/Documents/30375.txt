systematic investigations of the influence of geomagnetic
    disturbances on the daytime f layer critical frequencies a
    statistical analysis has been made of f layer critical
    frequencies observed at linden harz during the period december
    april and of geomagnetic observations made at wingst during the
    same period the geomagnetic data were arranged according to he
    degree of disturbance and the mean deviations of the critical
    frequencies corresponding to the different degrees of
    geomagnetic disturbance were determined dependence on sunspot
    cycle and on season is exhibited the significance of the
    results for the prediction of short wave communication
    conditions is discussed in detail figures are given indicating
    the reliability of such predictions
