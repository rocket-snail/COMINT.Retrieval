solar ionospheric tides in the f region the equation of
    continuity for electrons subject to the influence of a vertical
    drift harmonic in time has been integrated by numerical methods
    taking the processes of ion production and recombination into
    account for physica conditions representative of the f region
    the results of the analysis are applied to a brief discussion
    of the nature of the information regarding the vertical
    electron drift which can be derived from measured ionospheric
    data
