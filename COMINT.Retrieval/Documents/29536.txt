deviation from matthiessens rule and lattice thermal
    conductivity of alloys the difference in the ideal electronic
    thermal conductivity between an alloy and a pure metal can be
    estimated from the corresponding difference in the ideal
    electrical resistivity using the wiedemann franz law
