the fact database: a system based on inferential methods.
    the fact data base (a model for a new type of
    information-handling system) is described in terms of its main
    data structure (built from units of information called 'facts')
    and its conceptual section which manipulates the structure (the
    fact machine). its novelty arises from its internal knowledge
    structure-a model of the real world described by the data base
    and representation of information fed to the machine. this,
    augmented by information about set membership, enables the
    system to use inferential methods in many aspects of its
    operation. shows how these features lead to a simple, flexible
    interface, both to other computer systems and to 'user
    friendly' query languages.
