distribution of radio brightness on the solar disk at mcs
    observations during the first six months of made with
    interferometer equipment confirm the results obtained at the
    annular eclipse of bosson et al concerning the increased
    brightness at the edge of the disk further observations will be
    required to determine whether the radio brightness increases at
    first uniformly from the centre and then more rapidly to a
    maximum near the edge or whether there is a secondary maximum
    at the centre
