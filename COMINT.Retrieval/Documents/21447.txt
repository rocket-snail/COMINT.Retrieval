reduction of carrier frequency build up process to a
    complex low frequency process the laplace transform method is
    used by applying the displacement law the distortion of a
    carrier envelope due to a linear transmission element can be
    calculated directly vestigial as well as symmetrical sideband
    systems can be dealt with in this way
