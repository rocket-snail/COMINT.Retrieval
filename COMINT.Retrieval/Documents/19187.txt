the application of onsagers theory to dielectric
    dispersion a new equation for the complex dielectric constant
    which includes the proper effect of the reaction field is
    developed for the case of an alternating applied field it is
    shown to yield results very close to those obtained with the
    simple debye equation for the complex dielectric
    constant
