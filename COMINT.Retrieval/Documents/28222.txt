determination of drift movements of the ionosphere at
    high latitudes from radio star scintillations an apparent
    reversal in drift direction of the component in three aerial
    radio scintillation measurements at tromso is discussed it can
    be explained by assuming the diffracting medium to consist of
    elongated blobs with the main direction lying along the
    projection of the geomagnetic field lines as seen from the
    radio source
