disturbances in the ionospheric f region associated with
    geomagnetic storms middle latitudes disturbances at middle
    latitudes are divided into negative and positive types
    characteristic of high and low latitudes respectively these
    results are discussed in terms of vertical drift of electrons
    and the disturbance daily variations in the geomagnetic field
    the bearing of the dynamo current on seasonal and latitude
    variations of disturbances is discussed part of
