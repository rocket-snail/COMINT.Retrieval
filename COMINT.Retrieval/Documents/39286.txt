developing a focus for library and information research
    in the social sciences in the united kingdom. the development
    of research into social science library, information, and
    documentation problems is reviewed with special reference to
    work in the uk since the mid-1960s. some very promising lines
    of investigation were opened up through funded research. since
    the mid-1970s, there has been less support for work in this
    field, although there is great potential for the
    implementation, development, and innovation of services.
    developments must take account of the special needs and nature
    of the social sciences. some background issues relevant to
    development of library and information policies for the
    discipline are discussed in a national and international
    context. these matters form the agenda for the standing
    conference on social science information (scossi), which was
    founded in 1977.
