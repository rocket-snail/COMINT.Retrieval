high power radio frequency broad band transformers the
    design of wide band transformers composed of simple
    transmission line elements and capable of handling radio
    frequency power of the order of is discussed examples are given
    of devices matching ohm coaxial cable to balanced pair
    transmission lines with a standing wave ratio of less than over
    the band
