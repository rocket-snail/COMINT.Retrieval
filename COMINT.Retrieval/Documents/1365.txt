the effects of library automation on staff and readers
    must be investigated. research has concentrated on the
    technical aspects of library automation and neglected the
    sociological aspects, so that opinion on the positive and
    negative effects is sharply divided. the main purpose of
    automation is to increase the effectiveness of library
    procedures; service changes are still regarded as side-effects.
    automation's value must be judged in terms of the average
    non-academic reader. the time saved for staff through
    automation of routine procedures must be used for
    reader-oriented activities, for which further staff training
    should be provided. the results of experiences in this field
    from libraries abroad should be studied carefully.
