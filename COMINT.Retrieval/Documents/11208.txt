scintillation spread f and trans equatorial scatter both
    radio star scintillation and spread f show little dependence on
    magnetic activity during sunspot minimum at sunspot maximum
    they are strongly negatively correlated whilst transequatorial
    scatter is positively correlated with magnetic activity
