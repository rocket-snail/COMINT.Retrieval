experimental two beam excitation of electron oscillations
    in a plasma without sheaths coherent standing waves of
    longitudinal electron oscillations have been excited in a
    plasma bx two independent oppositely directed electron beams
    whose axes coincided there were no sheaths on the electrodes
    from which the electron stream entered the plasma results of
    single beam experiments looney and brown using either equal or
    unequal sheaths are verified
