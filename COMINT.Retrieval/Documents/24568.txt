field of a uniformly charged disk and magnetic field of a
    thin circular cylinder coil with contiguous turns traversed by
    a direct current the field of the uniformly charged disk is
    used to study that of the coil by virtue of the magnetic ee
    between the coil and a magnet of the same shapquivalence
    between coil and magnet and same shape with opposite magnetic
    poles on the two end faces formulae for mutual and self
    inductance are hence derived
