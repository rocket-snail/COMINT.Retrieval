method of amplitude control of ac signals a circuit for
    controlling the rms value of an ac signal is analysed and
    practical results are discussed the speed of response is such
    that for rates of change of per second the output is controlled
    continuously within an alternative arrangement for maintaining
    at a preset level the peak value of repetitive pulses is also
    given
