coupling of computer processed indexes to a
    photocomposing unit to improve the readability. describes the
    details of a project undertaken to explore the possibility of
    improving the readability of a computer assisted index
    (presently brought out by a line printer) by taking the output
    onto a paper tape in a compatible manner that can be fed to a
    film setter directly to provide lower-case letters and italic
    founts, with a flexibility of varying the point size.
