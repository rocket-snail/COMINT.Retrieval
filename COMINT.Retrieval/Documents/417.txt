selection of bibliographical materials and acquisition
    policy' general problems. discusses the situation in latin
    america's underdeveloped countries, with particular reference
    to university libraries. examines the state of education in
    general, where higher education has been developed usually at
    the expense of the elementary stages; library development has
    benefited accordingly, but although some university libraries
    are adequately resourced, rationalisation and planning of
    future policies is essential to maximise use of resources.
    hence librarians should develop definite selection and
    acquisition policies using the advice of specialists, and
    disregarding restrictions of resources by authorities
    unappreciative of the importance of libraries in promoting
    culture and scientific knowledge.
