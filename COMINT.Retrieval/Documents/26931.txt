control of frequency and phase displacement in transistor
    converter circuits by means of rc networks a new type of
    adjustable frequency transistor converter is described in which
    the operating frequency is controlled by a rc network and is
    independent of the direct voltage power regulation by means of
    rc phase control of a pair of transistor converters is
    discussed
