transient response calculation approximate method for
    minimum phase shift networks the well known method of linear
    segments for the calculation of zero pole locations of the
    transfer function corresponding to a given attenuation
    characteristic is extended by allowing the zeros and the poles
    to assume complex instead of only real values
