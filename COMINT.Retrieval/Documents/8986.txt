sweep frequency measurement of the ionosphere continuous
    records of f layer heights were obtained with equipment
    covering the frequency band in sec the records show marked
    discontinuities at approximately and local time the
    corresponding graphs of f layer heights for several stations in
    japan and of the geomagnetic variations at one station are
    shown
