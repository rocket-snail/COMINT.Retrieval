the sacred cow' library work with children. argues that
    public library service to children in the uk suffers from the 2
    alternative structures which characterise its provision. 1
    structure separates work with children completely from work
    with adults, and regards it as the responsibility of
    specialists' the other assumes, in contrast, that children have
    no specific needs, and staff need no training in dealing with
    them. advocates a structure in which the execution of
    children's work is the responsibility of the community library
    staff, trained and supported by specialists.
