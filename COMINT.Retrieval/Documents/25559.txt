gain bandwidth and noise in maser amplifiers a
    theoretical study reveals that the optimum gain bandwidth
    product of the two port maser is only half that of the
    circulator maser for the same basic cavity the optimum noise
    figure is the same if some bandwidth is sacrificed in the two
    port maser practical considerations may however make the latter
    competitive
