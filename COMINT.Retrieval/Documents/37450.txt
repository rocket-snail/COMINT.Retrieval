high field electron emission from irregular cathode
    surfaces the enhancement of the field in front of an emitter
    due to surface irregularities is studied in detail with
    reference to mechanisms proposed by and by the enhancement
    factor varies with distance from the surface and is also field
    dependent the results afford and explanation of anomalous
    conduction variations in liquids and gases
