a theorem on the impedance transforming properties of
    reactive networks two circle transformations derived from the
    impedance transformation properties of a terminal network are
    used to develop a circle locus theorem which considerably
    simplifies analysis of impedance matching networks it is
    applicable to any linear reactive network with any arbitrary
    reference impedance not lying on the reactance axis
