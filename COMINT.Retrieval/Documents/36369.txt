children's libraries: the literacy place. based on a
    speech given at the ottawa library association conference, oct
    81. libraries in ontario were contacted in order to investigate
    children's literacy projects. special programmes were found at
    etobicoke, north york and london. windsor public library
    specialises in reading to children. some libraries offer
    practical workshops; do they help literacy? author susan glazer
    specifies 7 language exercises' listening; writing; acting;
    playing; constructing; reading; thinking. the library should
    supply all situations conducive to these activities, e.g. story
    hours, book making, drama groups, crafts. observation of the
    children and of their attention and progress, and contact with
    parents, are advised.
