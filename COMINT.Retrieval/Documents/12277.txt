velocity distribution of electrons in presence of an
    alternating electric field and constant magnetic field two
    cases are considered theoretically the electric field varies
    sinusoidally and te variation is amplitude modulated case is of
    interest in the investigation of ionospheric crossmodulation
    the effect of collisions between electrons is taken into
    account
