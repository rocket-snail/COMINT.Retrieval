some general properties of nonlinear elements general
    energy relations an analysis is made of power relations in
    networks with reactive nonlinear elements two equations are
    derived relating the powers at different frequencies the only
    assumption introduced is that the nonlinear characteristic is
    single valued the theory is relevant to the operation of
    modulators demodulators and harmonic generators
