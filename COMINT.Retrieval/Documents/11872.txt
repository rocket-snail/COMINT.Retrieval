induced and spontaneous emission in a coherent field the
    resonant interaction between a coherently oscillating radiation
    field and a number of similar atomic systems coupled to the
    field through their electric dipole moments is analysed quantum
    mechanically distinction is drawn between coherent and
    incoherent parts of the energy terms corresponding to induced
    and spontaneous emission are identified and it is shown that
    the latter includes both coherent and incoherent components
    special situations related to masers and to the coherence of
    spontaneous radiation are discussed
