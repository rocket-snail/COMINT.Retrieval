diffraction of electromagnetic waves according to
    braunbeks approximation braunbeks approximation method is
    applied to problems of e m wave diffraction in particular to
    that of a linearly polarized plane wave normally incident on a
    circular aperture in a perfectly conducting plane screen and on
    a perfectly conducting plane circular disk the near field
    distribution is calculated and compared with results of the
    rigorous method of solution and of kirchhoffs approximation
    other approximation methods are discussed
