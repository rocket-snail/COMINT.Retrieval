cosmic radiation intensity decreases observed at the
    earth and in the nearby planetary medium measurements made
    simultaneously at earth radii at balloon altitudes and on the
    earths surface at the time of a large forbush decrease show the
    same magnitude of decrease of primary cosmic radiation these
    results do not therefore agree with hypotheses which invoke the
    presence of the earth and the geomagnetic field to account for
    the forbush decrease
