reflection from a wire grid parallel to a conducting
    plane the parallel wire grid backed by a conducting plane can
    be represented by an impedance shunted across a transmission
    line as in the case of a single wire the value of this
    impedance depends on the angle of incidence the spacing of the
    grid wires and the distance between grid and backing plane
    conditions are derived for the reflection coefficient to become
    zero
