alternative modes for providing graduate education for
    librarianship in ohio' final report. report of research
    initiated due to the fact that only 2 ohio library schools
    accredited by the ala are located in northeastern ohio, merely
    35 miles apart. the study includes a needs assessment, a
    resources assessment, and an analysis of 4 alternative
    approaches-a new programme model, a programme transfer model,
    an extension model, and a consortium model. amongst the
    conclusions are the following' northeastern ohio will continue
    to provide 40% of the professional employment opportunities in
    the state through 1990; a new graduate school will not be
    warranted in the 1980s because of the tight job market; and
    transfer of kent's programme to columbus would leave a serious
    gap in northeastern ohio.
