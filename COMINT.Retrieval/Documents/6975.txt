libraries and the united nation's international year of
    the disabled. contribution to an issue devoted to library
    services for the disabled. discusses the significance of the
    international year of the disabled in a present and future
    library context. libraries must assist handicapped people to
    take part in the social and cultural life of the community on
    equal terms with everyone else, but this means that they must
    have equal access to the information and expressive human
    experience caught by the printed word. a total or partial
    reading handicap will hinder this access. to the library falls
    the task of breaking down the barriers which prevent those with
    a reading handicap from gaining access to the message contained
    by words in print.
