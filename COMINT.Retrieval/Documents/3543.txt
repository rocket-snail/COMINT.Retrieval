a system of magnetic moments in a weak variable magnetic
    field a mathematical analysis of a system of magnetic moments
    which possesses electric exchange and weak magnetic dipole
    dipole interactions and which is located in an external
    magnetic field the equation of motion of the magnetization
    vector is derived and the limits of its applicability are
    discussed
