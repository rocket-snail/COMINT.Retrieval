information and referral for handicapped individuals.
    contribution to a thematic issue on information services for
    the disabled. information is no panacea and is not a substitute
    for services, but it can contribute towards overcoming many of
    the barriers around the handicapped. there is quite a lot of
    information and referral activity for the handicapped in the
    usa, but it is unevenly distributed and the handicapped are not
    always aware of it. libraries can be a great source of basic
    information about handicapping conditions, coping techniques,
    additional information sources, and relevant local and national
    organisations. includes a bibliography of us publications
    containing information on information and referral services for
    the handicapped.
