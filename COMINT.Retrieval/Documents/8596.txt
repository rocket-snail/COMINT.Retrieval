mechanism of the synchronization of lc oscillators the
    pulling effect on the phase a and frequency of an lc oscillator
    due to interference is considered the phase change is
    calculated for the case of a single interfering pulse a series
    of equidistant pulses and a sinusoidal voltage interfering
    pulses occurring at an oscillator voltage peak affect the
    amplitude those occurring at zero voltage cause a change in
    phase only these phase changes are permanent a differential
    equation relating oscillator voltage phase deviation time peak
    oscillator voltage and the magnitude of the interference
    current is solved and the conditions for synchrononism are
    obtained
