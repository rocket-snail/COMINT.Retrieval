a new automatic frequency regulation system brief
    description of a system for stabilizing the output of a k band
    klystron the error signal is derived from a phase comparison of
    a driving signal with the rectified microwave signal reflected
    from a dimension modulated reference cavity the resonance
    frequency of the cavity is controlled by a driven rochelle salt
    crystal
