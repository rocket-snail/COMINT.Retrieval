a method of evaluation of the quasi stationary distortion
    of fm signals in tuned interstages a graphical approach to the
    problem of designing low distortion f circuits making use of
    the normalized derivative of the phase frequency function is
    shown to be preferable to that using the phase frequency curve
    itself the principles are applied to the determination of the
    distortion factor of a single tuned circuit interstage and of a
    cascade arrangement of three stagger tuned resonant
    circuits
