filter using coaxial transmission line as elements exact
    equivalent circuits are presented for coaxial line elements
    with sleeve or undercut sections taking account of capacitance
    or inductance effects at the discontinuities from the
    corresponding equations the performance of filters comprising
    one or more of such elements can be pred in terms of image
    impedance cut off frequency attenuation and band limits
    measurements on a tvariable usw filters results of an
    investigation of filters with distributed circuit elements and
    their equivalents with lumped lcr indicate the circuits
    suitable for usw use the filters described which consist of
    adjustabl cavity resonators and short lines include separating
    filters for metre ba d television and an adjacent channel
    suppressor for transmitters and transmitter receivers
