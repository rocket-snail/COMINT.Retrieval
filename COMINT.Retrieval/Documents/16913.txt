nonlinear multipoles a conceptual scheme is outlined
    which is intended to be used in conjunction with theories of
    oriented graphs and with machine computers for the analysis and
    design of nonlinear networks a system of classes of nonlinear
    multipoles is defined the classes being characterized by their
    responses to a particular set of pulses see also of
