use of foreign language literature in cereals research.
    the use and effect of foreign language literature on cereals
    research in nigeria was determined by using a multi-method
    approach. english language and indigenous african language
    literature was excluded. languages included were french,
    german, spanish, russian, japanese and chinese. methods used in
    the survey were a two-year analysis of the loans records of the
    national cereals research institute library, questionnaires
    distributed to research scientists and analyses of the foreign
    language references in recent publications and theses of the
    scientists. results showed that scientists make little use of
    foreign language literature because few of them are able to
    read these languages. consequently scientists are missing
    important information and there is duplication of research
    which use of foreign language literature could minimise.
    results also showed that french, german, chinese and japanese
    are important in cereals research.
