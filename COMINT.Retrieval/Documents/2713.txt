the trier library model. the trier university library was
    opened in autumn 70 shortly before the university itself. it
    faced many problems from the start and they have not yet all
    been solved although the library is now operating successfully.
    it is run as an integrated university library. this system
    brought considerable opposition from university staff who
    preferred traditional institute libraries. the library is
    ideally constructed for its purpose, and technical facilities,
    presentation and content of library stock are also
    satisfactory. the problems still existing are connected to the
    university laws concerning the library which do not guarantee
    the competence of the library director in library matters. this
    has led to interference in library affairs by other university
    bodies and demands for special user rights by university
    staff.
