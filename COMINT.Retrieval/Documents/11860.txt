capacitance of selenium rectifiers in ac measurements on
    se rectifiers a temperature dependent phase shift between
    current and voltage is produced representation of the rectifier
    by an equivalent circuit consisting of a resistor and parallel
    capacitor affords a satisfactory explanation of this discussion
    shows that a negative component of capacitance is concerned
    which decreases with decreasing current and with increasing
    frequency the abnormal decrease of capacitance with high
    reverse voltages observed by hoffmann of is in agreement with
    this
