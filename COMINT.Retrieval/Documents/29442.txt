scattering and attenuation by non spherical atmospheric
    particles gans theory of em scattering and absorption by
    ellipsoids is applied to atmospheric particles if these have
    preferred orientations the amount of back scattered energy
    depends on particle shape and on orientation of the particle
    relative to the incident beam the effect is negligible in the
    case of snow if the particles have random orientations the
    observed scattering is independent of aerial orientation but
    greater for ellipsoidal shape and for water particles than for
    ice these theoretical considerations account well for known
    melting band phenomena
