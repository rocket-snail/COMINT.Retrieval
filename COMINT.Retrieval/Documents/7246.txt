function generation with operational amplifiers errors in
    analogue computers caused by diode limiters can be reduced by
    using accurate electronic switches with high gain d c
    amplifiers and voltage feedback applications of the techniques
    for comparators multivibrators and integrator reset circuits
    are described and future applications are indicated
