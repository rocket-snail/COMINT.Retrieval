a national library service' purpose and functions with
    special reference to zambia. (mls thesis.) examines current
    developments regarding national library services, international
    developments, and regional developments within africa,
    especially the eastern, central and southern african region,
    against the background of developments within zambia. the
    zambian developments are shown to be inadequate and too
    uncoordinated and the country's present library services are
    claimed not to be sufficiently oriented towards meeting
    national political and social aspirations. a national library
    service is designed which will (1) meet zambia's specific needs
    and (2) co-exist smoothly with national library services in
    other parts of the world.
