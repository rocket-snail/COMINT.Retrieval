problem of retrieval file structure optimisation
    according to retrieval time criterion. when developing on-line
    retrieval systems, the speed of response to inquiries is one of
    the main characteristics of the system's quality. considers a
    component of response time-the descriptor retrieval time.
    discusses direct, inverse, and combined patterns of file
    organisation, makes a comparative analysis, and evaluates
    descriptor retrieval time for each. proposes a probability
    model of retrieval in a combined file. on the basis of this
    model, the problem of optimising a combined file according to
    the time criterion is solved.
