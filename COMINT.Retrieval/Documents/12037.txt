magnetic flux produced by a dipole located inside a
    ferromagnetic circular wire an approximate formula is derived
    for the magnetic flux through a coaxial plane circular area
    normal to the wire due to magnetic dipole element inside the
    wire the radii of the circular area and the wire are assumed to
    be small compared with the axial distance between the circular
    area and the dipole element for experimental confirmation of
    the formula
