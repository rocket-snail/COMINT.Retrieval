the investigation of ionospheric absorption by a new
    automatic method part measurements on vertical incidence pulse
    signals equipment is described which automatically measures
    echo pulse amplitude and produces records at minute intervals
    of the integral of all echo pulse amplitudes received during
    each minute the output of a modified communications receiver
    blanked so as not to respond to the transmitter pulse is fed to
    two gated amplifiers one of which selects the echo signal and
    associated noise while the other deals with nose only after
    integration for min the difference of the output voltages of
    the integrators is applied to a pen recorder the integrators at
    the same time being reset to zero under good conditions with
    little rapid fading the results obtained are in good agreement
    with results noted by a skilled observer from a cro display of
    the transmitted and echo pulses wide differences are found
    under poor conditions with rapid fading and the results
    furnished by the automatic equipment are considered the more
    reliable
