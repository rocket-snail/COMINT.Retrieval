some magnetic properties of metals part surface
    corrections of the landau diamagnetism and the de haas van
    alphen effect an expression is given for the magnetic moment of
    a large but finite system of electrons in terms of the volume
    and two mutually perpendicular surface areas together with
    constants independent of the shape of the system the theory is
    verified by calculating the values of the constants for two
    different shapes corrections to part are noted
