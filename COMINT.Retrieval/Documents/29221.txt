measurement of the ionospheric absorption during the igy
    at kokubunji the diurnal variation in absorption shows an
    asymmetry about noon which is attributed to the changes in
    vertical drift motion in the d layer associated with the
    current system the marked winter anomaly effect cannot be
    explained by a change in the electron density distribution in
    the normal d layer
