computer-assisted mechanistic evaluation of organic
    reactions. 2. perception of rings, aromaticity, and tautomers.
    new algorithms for the perception of rings, aromaticity, and
    tautomers were developed in conjunction with the cameo program
    for computer-assisted mechanistic evaluation of organic
    reactions. a noteworthy aspect of the ring algorithm is that
    only rings belonging to the smallest set of smallest rings are
    found. results for representative molecules are presented, and
    rules for determining the aromaticity/tautomer status of rings,
    especially heterocycles, are discussed.
