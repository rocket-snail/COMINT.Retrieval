local systems' design and costs. contribution to the lita
    (american library association. library and information
    technology association) institute. a local approach to the
    automation of acquisitions processes was, until comparatively
    recently, the only alternative available. guidelines for the
    design process are well documented; costs are not. investigates
    pitfalls to a local approach and lists alternatives. explores
    trends such as the increasing importance of interface with
    national or other local systems, and the greater demands for
    managerial data. suggests that a less rigid, traditional
    approach towards automating acquisitions functions might be
    more effective, and that a thorough investigation of available
    alternatives should precede a decision to adopt or maintain a
    totally local approach.
