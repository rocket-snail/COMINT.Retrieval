a generalization of weissflochs transformation law the
    transformation law relating to a loss free quadripole between
    homogeneous lines is generalized by showing that all points on
    the transformation curve can be correlated with corresponding
    positions on the input and output lines between which the
    quadripole acts as an ideal transformer with a reactance in
