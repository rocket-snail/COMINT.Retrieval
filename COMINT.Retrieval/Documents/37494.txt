the effective recombination coefficient of an ionosphere
    containing a mixture of ions the effective recombination
    coefficient in the e layer can be estimated from the fall in
    electron density during the night from the changes during solar
    eclipses from the time lag in the diurnal peak density these
    coefficients can be expressed as functions of the coefficients
    for each of several different ions present and are shown to be
    different from each other it is suggested that and are the ions
    responsible during the day and that no ions predominate at
    night
