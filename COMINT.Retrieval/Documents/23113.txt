libraries as a link in a national information policy. an
    international seminar on libraries as public information
    centres indicates that norway is possibly the most advanced of
    the scandinavian countries (the swedish report is not
    available). moves are afoot to convince committees that public
    libraries, until now overlooked, are already largely equipped
    as information centres. in denmark a library commission was set
    up in 1976 to consider alterations in the danish library
    service, including the formation of a national information and
    library policy, and legislation is expected following their
    1979 report. in iceland a committee was established in 1975 to
    plan future information policy, and an information service,
    partly technical/scientific and partly a general national
    information body, began operation in 1978-79. finland has so
    far had no official information policy, but in 1980
    investigations began into reasons for such a policy,
    development plans, and resources required. the finnish sp eaker
    dealt mainly with special libraries.
