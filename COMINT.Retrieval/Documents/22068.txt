the field displacement isolator a nonreciprocal device
    with forward loss about and reverse loss about over a wide band
    at about is based on use of a single ferrite slab spaced from
    the wall of a rectangular wave guide and having a resistive
    strip on one face optimum field conditions in the waveguide are
    discussed
