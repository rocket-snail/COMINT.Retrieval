semidiurnal currents and electron drifts in the
    ionosphere the differential equations of the dynamo theory for
    the ionosphere are solved numerically under simplifying
    assumptions the tidal amplification estimated is about for the
    solar tide the current system in the e layer is in phase with
    the ground tide but for the lunar tide it it in phase
    opposition the calculated vertical electron drift is in
    reasonable agreement with lunar tide observations the
    calculated horizontal electron drift agrees with observations
    on long duration meteor trail echoes but the calculated phases
    are opposed to those obtained from fading measurements
    indicating that the latter refer to air movements and not to
    electron drift
