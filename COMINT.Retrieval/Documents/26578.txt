investigation of the electron emission from nickel
    experiments show that the work function of a single crystal of
    n reduced in hydrogen is higher above the curie point than
    below it this result is shown graphically field strengths of
    about were used in measurements of electron emission from a
    point source photographs of the emission patterns are
    shown
