ionospheric refraction in radio astronomy expressions are
    derived for the apparent displacements of cosmic radio sources
    at transit resulting from ionospheric refraction the theory
    includes the effects of horizontal electron density gradients
    which often outweigh those due to a spherically symmetrical
    ionosphere the relation of ionospheric refraction to the total
    thickness and the total electron content in a vertical column
    are discussed
