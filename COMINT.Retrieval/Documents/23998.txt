theory of a negative resistance transmission line
    amplifier with distributed noise generators a transmission line
    with distributed positive and negative resistances as well as
    with distributed noise factor are derived as a function of
    boundary conditions matching conditions and distributed noise
    it is found that low noise amplification can be achieved on
    such a line provided the lien is characterized by high gain per
    unit length high total gain good matching and low distributed
    noise a distortionless active line for such low noise
    amplifiers appears attractive
