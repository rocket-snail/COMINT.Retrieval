a theory of diurnal magnetic variations in equatorial
    regions and conductivity of the ionosphere e e region part the
    electrical conductivity of the e region is calculated in some
    detail for the factor by which the tidal oscillation of the e
    region exceeds that at ground level should be less than in oder
    to give the observed lunar magnetic variation the calculated
    lunar vertical movement of the e region is nearly in phase with
    that observed in south england and nearly opposite at canberra
    a possibility is shown that the calculated lunar vertical
    movement of the f region roughly agrees with that observed it
    is suggested that the vertical drifts of the f region near the
    magnetic equator may be much greter than those in the other
    latitudes
