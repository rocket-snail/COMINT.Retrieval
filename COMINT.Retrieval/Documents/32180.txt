on the excitation of oscillations in a thermal plasma
    plasma oscillations are considered for an arbitrary
    distribution of electron beams the fundamental equations are
    derived assuming a weak signal and the absence of static fields
    the dispersion relation derived is applied to the case of
    excitation of thermal plasma by an injected electron beam and
    the rate of wave growth is determined the numerical results are
    compared with results obtained by merrill and webb june
