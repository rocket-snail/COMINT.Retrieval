controls of geomagnetic activity by sunspots showed that
    a decrease of magnetic activity occurs when two sunspots or
    groups of sunspots are symmetrically located on the solar disk
    with respect to the solar equator on the basis of this work and
    that of denisse of it should be possible to forecast each year
    on an average about perturbed and quiet days
