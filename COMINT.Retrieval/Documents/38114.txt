longitude effect in temperate zone sporadic e and the
    earths magnetic field a correlation is shown to exist in both
    northern and southern temperate zones between the magnitude of
    the horizontal component of the earths magnetic field and the
    percentage of time this is considered with reference to the
    longitude effect investigated by smith and finney and it is
    suggested that the movement of ionization by winds or electric
    fields is the most likely source of e
