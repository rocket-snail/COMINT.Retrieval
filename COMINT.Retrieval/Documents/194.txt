dobis-wln impact study. report. the bcuc study team
    examined 3 systems for possible application to the british
    columbia union catalogue' washington library network, dobis as
    implemented by college bibliocentre and dobis as implemented by
    the national library of canada. it was found that none of the
    systems would be usable by bcuc without some modification. the
    national library version of dobis was selected with the
    qualification that more initial work would be needed than the
    others to bring it into production.
