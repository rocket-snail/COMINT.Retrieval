more about subject cataloguing. the italian library
    association needs to discuss and decide in 1 of its congresses'
    what practical value have serrai's propositions and deductions
    on the thesauri compiled by specialists and at what stage they
    are preferable to the current subject list notoriously omitted
    from the unique catalogue; enquiry, considerations and
    conclusions on the indiscriminate abuse of the principal
    subjects; criticism and discriminatory revision on the
    preeminence or otherwise of the geographical subjects; revision
    of the organisational and distributive principles of the
    cataloguing institute; and to what extent subject cataloguing
    can make use of electronics and computers without forgetting
    that original inspiration stems only from the human
    brain.
