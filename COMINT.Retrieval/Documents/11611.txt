on simulation studies of motion of bodies in ionized
    atmosphere the problems involved in laboratory model studies on
    satellite motion in an ionized z atmosphere are analysed
    scaling relations obtained satisfy the conditions for
    aerodynamic magneto hydrodynamic and electrodynamic similitude
    flight conditions corresponding to the earths upper atmosphere
    can be simulated by suitable scaling of he test model
