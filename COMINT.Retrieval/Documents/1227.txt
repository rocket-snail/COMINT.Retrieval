toward a comprehensive collection development policy for
    partial u.s. depository libraries. library literature has long
    ignored the problem of collection development for u.s.
    government publications. regional depositories are not
    adversely affected by this oversight. however, the partial
    depository library suffers the consequences. often in the past,
    the sole criterion for the building of a partial depisitory
    collection has been accretion without regard for other salient
    factors. at present and in the foreseable future, fiscal
    exigency will cause increasing demands to be made on the
    library's budget and space. in order to make judicious
    decisions which will permit the depotisory collection to grow
    in a manner responsive to its own needs, as well as to various
    curricular and community needs, a framework of policy must
    exist. it is in this context that a policy statement is
    presented.
