a consideration of radio star scintillations as caused by
    interstellar particles entering the ionosphere part daily and
    seasonal variations of the scintillation of a radio star part
    the accretion of interstellar particles as a cause of radio
    star scintillations an analysis is made of measurements of
    scintillations of the rf source in cassiopeia recorded at
    ottawa during at a frequency of the data show certain daily
    maxima occurring at solar times dependent on the date of the
    year and grouped unsymmetrically in a way which suggests that
    they are due to the infall of interstellar particles from
    outside the solar system the velocities of certain of these
    particles are derived by simple applications of vector addition
    employing the known velocity of the earth see also of
