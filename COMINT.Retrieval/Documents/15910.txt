new information and communication techniques in subject
    communication and documentation' economy, costs, finance and
    organisation. on-line services and screen discs are prominent
    among new technical developments in west germany and are used
    mainly by scientific publishers and information services. their
    use has resulted in an economic trend towards cooperation
    between similar firms or organisations or between complementary
    branches of industry. the on-line market is internationally
    oriented and the market leaders are mainly from
    english-speaking countries. the on-line information market has
    developed more slowly in west germany than in neighbouring
    countries. measures to counteract this should include'
    developing information policy with regard for economic aspects;
    encouraging cooperation between manufacturers and users; and
    concentrating the restricted supply of government money so as
    to favour the growth of private enterprise.
