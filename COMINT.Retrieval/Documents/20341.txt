user evaluation of a corporate library online search
    service. the responses to an evaluation questionnaire
    administered primarily to 1st-time and remote-site users of a
    corporate library on-line search service indicated that the
    searches yield a high % of relevant citations for most users. a
    further correlation between the users' responses to broad
    relevance categories and their presence at the terminal during
    the search reconfirmed the importance of interactive feedback
    between the user and the search intermediary in improving
    search precision. the study identified significant time savings
    by the users. most respondents endorsed the cost effectiveness
    of the service, particularly those involved in ongoing research
    projects or starting a new project.
