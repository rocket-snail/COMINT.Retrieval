viewdata-the implications for education. examines some of
    the implications of viewdata for education, with particular
    reference to the post office's prestel system. experiments by
    post office researchers have included simulations, multiple
    choice testing and graded quizzes. these activities are not
    available on the public system yet, but interactive learning is
    expected to take priority in future developments.
