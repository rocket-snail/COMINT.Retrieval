a wide band hybrid ring for uhf the bandwidth of a hybrid
    ring is increased by replacing the long arm with a line and
    introducing a frequency insensitive reversal of phase
    calculations are made of input and transfer admittances
    insertion loss and the effect of capacitance across the loads
    some experimental results are given and applications to power
    splitters harmonic generators mixers are indicated
