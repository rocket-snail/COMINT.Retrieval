public lending right' the american author's viewpoint.
    contribution to a thematic issue on public lending right (plr).
    plr faces obstacles that may well keep it from us shores for a
    long time. a sampling of us authors indicates that they are
    well aware of this, but harbour an attraction to plr that may
    blossom into the kind of support the concept has found
    elsewhere. this may give plr a ring of inevitability.
