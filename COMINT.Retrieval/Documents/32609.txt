theory of secondary electron emission by high speed ions
    a new theoretical treatment shows that the yield of secondaries
    is proportional to the rate of energy loss of the incident
    particles and is independent of work function conductivity and
    other bulk properties of the metal the theory explains the
    experimental observations and its application to general
    problems of electron escape and capture is discussed
