fluctuations in a plasma ion electron temperature
    relaxation the rate of relaxation calculated on the basis of
    the fluctuation dissipation theorem assuming interaction
    between the ion and the fluctuating electric field caused by
    the surrounding electrons is found to agree with the result
    obtained considering interactions with individual
    electrons
