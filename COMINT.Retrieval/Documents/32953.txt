on a new method of determining the height of the
    nightglow nightglow observations taken at two wo stations
    separated by a distance comparable with the height of the layer
    observed will show correlation over a period if both stations
    observe the same point the height of the point can hence be
    deduced observations taken during two successive nights give a
    height between and for the origin of the radiation
