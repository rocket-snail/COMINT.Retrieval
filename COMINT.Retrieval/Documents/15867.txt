proving monitors interesting scheduling and sequential
    properties of monitors can be proved by using state variables
    which record the monitor's history and by defining extended
    proof rules for their wait and signal operations. these two
    techniques are defined, discussed, and applied to examples to
    prove properties such as freedom from indefinitely repeated
    overtaking or unnecessary waiting upper bounds on queue
    lengths, and historical behavior. may, 1976 howard, j.h.
