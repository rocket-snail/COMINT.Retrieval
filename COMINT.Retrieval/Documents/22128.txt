verification of the logic structure of an experimental
    switching system on a digital computer the verification problem
    is concerned with the construction on a computer of a logical
    program which satisfies all the design specifications
    prescribed for an experimental switching system and with the
    process of putting calls though the computer simulation to
    evaluate the systems logical structure
