    engineers but in 1968 a postgraduate correspondence course on
    information and documentation was begun for graduates in
    science or technology with some work experience in information
    services. in 1981 a course commenced on scientific and
    technical information for students of electrotechnology;
    several short courses and seminars are also provided. many
    foreign students attend institute courses, which have aroused
    worldwide interest. the institute works closely with other
    libraries and institutes at national and international levels.
