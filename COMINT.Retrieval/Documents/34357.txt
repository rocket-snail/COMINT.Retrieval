special documentation services: 2 practical examples. in
    may 78 the provincial central library of limburg in the
    netherlands created a current and social affairs information
    service for public libraries in the region. at the central
    library a team of 2 staff scan 5 national and all local
    newspapers together with a number of journals of local interest
    for articles and information relating to limburg. the
    information extracted from these sources is classified into 75
    subject fields covering the social, cultural and political life
    of the province, and at present 57 libraries subscribe to this
    service. in the naarden-bussum central public library in the
    netherlands a similar service was formed in oct 79 relating to
    employment and training opportunities. due to lack of funds the
    service is organised by an unpaid, voluntary assistant.
