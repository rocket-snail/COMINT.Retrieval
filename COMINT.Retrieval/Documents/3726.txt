cpi surveys-a service to subscribers. the canadian
    periodical index (cpi) began as an indexing service at the
    windsor public library where, from 1924-32 mimeographed
    periodical indexes were produced. today it is organised by the
    canadian library association, which assumed responsibility for
    it in 1946. every 3 years cla establishes new rates by means of
    a subscription rate survey. a questionnaire is sent to all
    subscribers, listing periodicals covered by cpi, and asking
    subscribers to list which of these are included in the
    institution's holdings. cost-per-entry is then established, and
    total entries for a year in cpi are calculated. taking costs of
    salaries, automation, publishing and rent, cpi's budget is
    established. discusses the survey in detail and other
    considerations which arise from it.
