energy distributions of field dependent secondary
    electrons report of an experimental investigation of the
    emission from thin films of a retarding field technique was
    used the energy distribution was found to be maxwellian with
    values ranging from zero to and average values of to depending
    on the applied field the method is useful for determining the
    surface potential of the emitter
