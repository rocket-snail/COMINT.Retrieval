investigation of the shift in frequency and of the
    amplitude of oscillations of z a maser type self oscillator
    with liquid flow an experimental investigation of the effect of
    detuning a maser oscillator of the type described earlier of
    and of the influence of the rate of flow on the resonance line
    width the range of oscillation extends from to
