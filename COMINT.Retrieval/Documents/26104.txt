on the nonisothermal diffusion theory of rectifiers a
    general theory is developed from formal conduction theory the
    rectification equation obtained depends upon temperature
    distributions in a barrier values of the dielectric constant of
    barrier determined by analysis of experimental results using
    the new theory tend to approach those of the bulk
    materials
