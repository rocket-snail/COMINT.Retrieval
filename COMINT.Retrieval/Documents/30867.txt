determination of the coefficient of recombination in the
    ionosphere a simple method is suggested in which the
    recombination coefficient is determined from night time
    observations in terms of the gyrofrequency the mean observation
    frequency and the time interval between the disappearance of
    the ordinary and extraordinary ray echoes the value of for the
    f region found by this method using records of radio ceylon
    transmissions on is sec using vertical incidence measurements
    at calcutta a value of cm sec is obtained compared with cm sec
    calculated by the usual method
