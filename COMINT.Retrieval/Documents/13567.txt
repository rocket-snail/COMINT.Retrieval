possibility of detecting ionospheric drifts from the
    occurrence of spread f echoes at low latitudes observations of
    the times of occurrence of spread f echoes have been made at
    four stations in peru results suggest that ionospheric drifts
    may flay an important part in the occurrence of spread f echoes
    at low latitudes
