audio frequency spectrum of atmospherics results are
    reported of simultaneous recordings of the frequency components
    in the band the frequency of the largest component in the slow
    tail decreases as source distance increases and is higher at
    night than by day while for the oscillator part the opposite
    effect occurs selective attenuation at frequencies around is
    indicated
