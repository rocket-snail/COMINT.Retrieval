a general model of query processing in information
    retrieval systems. most current document retrieval systems
    require that user queries be specified in the form of boolean
    expressions. although boolean queries work, they have flaws.
    some of the attempts to overcome these flaws have involved
    'partial-match' retrieval or the use of fuzzy-subset theory.
    recently, some generalisations of fuzzy-subset theory have been
    suggested that would allow the user to specify queries with
    relevance weights or thresholds attached to terms. the various
    query-processing methods are discussed and compared.
