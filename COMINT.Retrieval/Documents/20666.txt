library data, statistics and information' progress toward
    comparability. libraries of all kinds and sizes are
    increasingly bound by common needs and concerns. this symbiosis
    has placed new demands upon the community. primary among these
    is the demand for common understandings and a language in which
    to share these understandings. one avenue to such an objective
    is outlined. foremost to this development is a framework of
    information about libraries. a method by which to catalogue the
    impressions of library behaviour and from which to move to some
    empirically based and sound theory of library behaviour is
    described.
