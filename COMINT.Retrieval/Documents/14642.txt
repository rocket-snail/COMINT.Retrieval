concerning the nature of the aberrations in electron
    sheet beams a power series expansion is used to derive
    expressions for the aberrations up to the third order in
    electron sheet beams subject to purely electrostatic focusing
    four purely geometric aberrations and four aberrations due to
    chromatic effects are found
