electron electron interaction and heat conduction in
    gaseous plasmas the thermal conductivity in low gas pressure ne
    and xe plasmas has been shown experimentally to be determined
    chiefly by heat flow in the electron gas of the plasma the
    experimentally determined values of the thermal conductivity
    are in agreement within less than one order of magnitude with
    those given by the theory of spitzer n harm
