culture for the cuban people. report on a visit to cuba
    to study the cultural centres. a national network of such
    centres is being built by the ministry of culture's department
    for mass culture. activities serve educational, recreative and
    ideological functions. each centre has a directorate, technical
    committee, contact group and user group, and activities range
    from creative workshops, study groups, lectures, music
    festivals, exhibitions, and library. the activities laid on in
    1 of havana's cultural centres, the plaza de la revolucion, are
    described in detail. the centre's library has mainly
    specialised works needed for the activities, although the
    children's section has a somewhat broader selection. the
    intention is that all cuba's districts shall have as a minimum
    a cultural centre, historical museum, public library, cinema,
    bookshop, art shop, choir, orchestra, theatre and art
    gallery.
