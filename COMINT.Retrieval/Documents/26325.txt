the theory of the anomalous skin effect in anisotropic
    metals the theory of the anomalous skin effect in metals is
    extended to a uniaxial metal crystal containing two energy
    bands in each of which the energy surfaces are ellipsoids of
    revolution about the crystal axis explicit formulae are
    obtained for the extreme anomalous limit giving the dependence
    of the surface impedance on the orientation of the crystal axis
    both for a plane metal surface and for a circular wire the
    results are evaluated numerically for tin and the surface
    conductivity of a circular wire is found to show the minimum
    observed by pippard of the parameters can be chosen to give
    reasonable agreement with pippards results
