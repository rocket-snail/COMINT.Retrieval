the impact of the oclc interlibrary subsystem on a
    science oriented academic library. analysis and statistics are
    presented for 1 year of the california institute of technology
    library's use of oclc as a borrower, as well as a lender. the
    knowledge of location of items in a wide range of libraries has
    made interloan request communications for books easier,
    quicker, and more precise. requests by caltech for journal
    articles, reports, etc. are not handled via oclc. requests
    received from other libraries show some lack of discrimination
    by specifying items not shown as at caltech or by asking for
    recently published books. however, the volume of such requests
    is small.
