component design trends new variable capacitors extend
    tuning range over different types of variable capacitor in
    production were surveyed an outline is given of techniques used
    for obtaining low minimum capacitance and high maximum
    capacitance adapting for operation at uhf miniaturizing and
    pressurizing
