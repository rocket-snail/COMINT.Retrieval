ten years' struggle gave a result in lorenskog: new
    premises, great increase in loans-now only staff are lacking.
    lorenskog central library, norway, was established in school
    premises in 1967 as a combined public/school library. from the
    1st it was too small and the combination proved unsatisfactory.
    in 1971 a reorganisation plan for the library service included
    a new central library. after several years of postponements,
    worsening conditions and staff protests, the library rented 650
    sq.m. in a new office block-more than double its existing
    accommodation, though half the space proposed in 1971-and
    opened there in summer 80. loans have risen by 85%. lack of
    staff necessitates a reduction of 9 hours per week in opening
    times, and prevents any extension activities, but the staff
    intended to continue their fight for better library
    service.
