proposed satellite techniques for performing a high
    resolution survey of the radio sky at medium wavelengths the
    reception pattern of a short dipole above the f layer is
    modified by refraction in the ionized medium the properties of
    this pattern are discussed and satellite experiments using this
    phenomenon are suggested
