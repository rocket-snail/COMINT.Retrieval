courses for special librarianship offered in a.l.a.
    accredited programs and implications for the education of
    science/technology librarians. a survey was made of the 68
    library schools with a.l.a. accreditation to ascertain the
    extent and types of their courses in special librarianship, in
    specific types of special libraries, and in specific types of
    literature. from the survey results it was possible to make an
    analysis of the extent to which these courses would serve the
    needs of those interested in science/technology libraries. the
    role of field work was also investigated. statistics are
    presented on the number and types of courses offered and the
    type of field work available for students concerned with
    sci-tech librarianship.
