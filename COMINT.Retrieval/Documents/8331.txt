european convention on information on foreign law.
    provides a textual analysis of the european convention on
    information on foreign law, which came into being as a result
    of formal recognition by the council of europe that increasing
    movement of persons and goods across european frontiers has
    resulted in an interpenetration of laws and the attendant need
    to take foreign law into consideration. discusses the procedure
    and precedent for accession of a state not a member of the
    council of europe. describes the implementation of the
    convention in austria, denmark, greece, the netherlands and
    west germany.
