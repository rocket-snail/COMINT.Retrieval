synthesis of poles by networks containing the minimum
    number of elements the method of r brune is extended to the
    synthesis of passive poles the procedure is illustrated for
    after splitting off a series resistance the number of elements
    in the pole can be reduced and by repeating this procedure the
    pole of zero order can be realized as shown
