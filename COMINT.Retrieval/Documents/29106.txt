the recombination coefficient in the layer during aurorae
    in an earlier paper a mechanism involving variations in
    positive ion concentration was suggested to explain the
    abnormally high values of recombination coefficient during
    aurorae an alternative explanation assuming a high value of the
    negative ion electron ratio is shown to be in accordance with
    observed data
