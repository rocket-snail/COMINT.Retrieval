the geometrical representation of combined linear
    quadripoles concepts of non euclidean geometry are used the
    representation of reactance quadripoles by a rigid system of
    two straight transformation lines and the determination of
    impedance transformations from geometrical reflections afford
    useful methods for treating composite quadripoles
