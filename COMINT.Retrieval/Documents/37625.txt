some problems on obstacles placed in the path of
    electromagnetic radiation the relations between the incident
    reflected and refracted fields at the surface separating two
    media are studied using vectorial analysis with a system of
    coordinates attached to the surface both media may be
    dielectrics or one may be conducting the plane separating
    surface is discussed first and the analysis is extended to
    treat diffraction by a sphere exact formulae are derived for
    the re radiation gain and the total diffusion surface
