library services to physically disabled persons. the
    international year for disabled persons 1981 has drawn the
    attention to the 8% of the world population who are disabled in
    some way. considerable attention has been given to the library
    needs of these people. in order to offer them equal rights and
    equal opportunities as able persons in the library, several
    requirements for the physical lay-out and equipment should be
    considered. blind persons have a well-coordinated south african
    library service with books in braille or moon print and books
    on tape at their disposal. almost all other disabled persons
    can rely with confidence on the service of their nearby
    library. special attempts will be made to supply them with
    books, in general as well as aimed at their specific needs.
    e.g. how to adapt to their way of living as disabled persons
    (dealing with the practical aspects like clothing and housing)
    and how to accept reality (healing of the mind).
