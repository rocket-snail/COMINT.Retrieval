the practical significance of complex frequencies in
    electrical communication engineering a concise general
    introduction to the subject complex frequencies are complex
    quantities whose real part represents the gain of a system and
    whose imaginary part represents the frequency in the usual
    sense the application of the laplace transform in analysis of
    transmission problems is explained and the properties of the
    complex plane and its poles and zeros are described the use of
    the poles and zeros for representation of the transmission
    characteristics of a linear network iis considered analogues of
    the complex plane such as that obtainable with a stretched
    elastic membrane are discussed and their applications
    illustrated
