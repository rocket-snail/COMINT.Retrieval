an experimental investigation of subharmonic oscillations
    in a nonlinear system forced subharmonic oscillations in a
    circuit containing an iron core are studied damping is reduced
    by means of feedback so that measurements can be effected at
    very low driving voltages and subharmonics up to the ninth
    results are in good agreement with theory developed by
    lundquist for low driving voltages
