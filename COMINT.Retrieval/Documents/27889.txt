a theoretical current density ansatz for the quiet day
    solar semidiurnal tidal mode of oscillation of the ionosphere
    theoretical expressions which embody the generalized
    atmospheric dynamo mechanism of the origin of upper atmospheric
    current systems are derived for the current density vector by
    numerical integration methods approximate expressions may be
    obtained for the current density over an ionized shell
    concentric with the earth
