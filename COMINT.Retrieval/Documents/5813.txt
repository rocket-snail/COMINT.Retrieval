temperature compensation in a low consumption transistor
    amplifier the circuit design is developed for a two stage
    amplifier for the frequency range giving a stable distortion
    free output of with an ambient temperature variable over the
    range by suitable choice of circuit elements compensation is
    obtained without increased power consumption and the amplifier
    characteristics may be made independent of the actual
    transistors used
