diffraction of a pulse by a resistive half plane the two
    dimensional diffraction problem acoustic or em in which the
    incident pulse front is parallel to the edge of a half plane is
    solved by assuming dynamic similarity in the solu ion relations
    between the problem and the three dimensional problem which
    arises when a plane pulse is incident obliquely at the edge of
    a resistive half plane are discussed
