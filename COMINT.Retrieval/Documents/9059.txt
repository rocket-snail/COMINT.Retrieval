access to documents' co-operation versus centralisation.
    there is a great need for an efficient and planned national
    system of access to documents. discusses reasons for inaction
    in this area and criteria for national document supply systems.
    describes 4 basic models of national interlending systems'
    model a is one of total centralisation on 1 source; model b
    concentrates provision on 2 or 3 libraries; model c
    concentrates supply on a greater number of libraries, specially
    designated and funded for the purpose; and model d, which
    exists in most countries, is 1 of total decentralisation. looks
    at combinations of these models, the economics of
    centralisation, centralised 2versus1 cooperative solutions and
    effect of technology.
