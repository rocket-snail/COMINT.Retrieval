initial conditions in transient analysis in a paper on
    network theory of lee and macdonald indicated the equivalence
    of a charged capacitor and the series combination of an
    uncharged capacitor and a battery extension of this idea to
    consideration of inductors leads to a simple method of
    analysing initial conditions the method is elucidated by two
    theorems and examples the laplace transform treatment is
    used
