book theft and book mutilation in a large urban
    university library. a questionnaire study of why students in a
    large us urban university steal and mutilate library books and
    periodicals identified psychological and sociological
    motivational factors in the students. circumstantial reasons
    for such deviant behaviour were not significant in this study.
    the individual student's perceptions of pressure for sources in
    the academic world seemed to motivate mutilation and theft
    regardless of the quality of available library service. peer
    approval for these behaviours was not apparently
    assumed.
