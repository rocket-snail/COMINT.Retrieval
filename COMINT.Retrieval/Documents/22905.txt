the colon in udc. in udc a large number of symbols are
    used to form the complex notation. most of these symbols have
    several possible meanings which cause problems, especially in
    the case of the colon, when udc is used in an automated
    information system. the colon is clearly intended as a sign
    denoting a relationship needing no further definition between 2
    numbers. the use of the colon with more than 2 udc numbers,
    although unofficial, has become widespread; the range of
    permitted permutations is described. where the colon may be
    used between 2 numbers, the possible reversibility of the
    relationship may be taken for granted. if the possibility of
    permutation is removed then the colon resumes its original
    function of denoting a hierarchic relationship between 2 or
    more udc numbers.
