studies on the sunrise effect in regions e and f to be
    effective in causing ionization in a night time layer solar
    radiation must pass above the day time height of the layer the
    observed delay in time of sunrise effect is due therefore to
    the difference between the night time and day time heights of
    the layer considered observations made at calcutta over the
    period are in reasonable agreement with the theory
