the crust as the possible seat of earths magnetism
    magnetic material in the earths crust to a depth of will be
    highly permeable as a result of temperature and pressure
    conditions interaction between solar corpuscular streams and a
    very weak initial magnetic field in the crust will magnetize it
    to saturation the estimated magnetic moment of the shell agrees
    with the observed magnetic moment of the earth
