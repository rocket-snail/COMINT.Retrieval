the overrated plb-a fiasco to fix. the use of public
    library binding (plb), advocated for children's books in the
    early 1950s by the ala association of library service to
    children (then children's services division), has been a
    fiasco. plbs vary in quality and some last no more than a few
    circulations. it is especially foolish for large libraries to
    buy any plb they do not need because their 38-40% trade
    discounts make them bear the brunt of the inequitable plb net
    pricing systems. reviews the problems caused by plb and
    contends that binding standards must be set which cater for
    books less durable than lbi class 'a' standards and which
    nullify the obfuscating pricing schemes.
