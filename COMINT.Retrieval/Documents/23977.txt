transport schemes for interlibrary lending' the uk
    experience. where postal services are slow, unreliable or
    expensive, dedicated transport schemes for interlending
    purposes should be considered; their usefulness will vary from
    1 country to another, according to local circumstances. in the
    uk, feasibility studies were followed by the setting up of
    transport schemes in a number of the uk library regions, and a
    national scheme linking the regions was envisaged. transport
    schemes were not considered worthwhile in the larger regions
    with less interlending activity. a methodology for setting up
    schemes has been devised. the present transport schemes are
    financially competitive and likely to remain so. uk experience
    might provide a framework for assessing potential schemes in
    other countries.
