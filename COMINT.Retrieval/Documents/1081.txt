irregularity and regularity of the sporadic layer from
    observations at recording stations much information is obtained
    about the highest vertical incidence reflection frequency but
    less about the blanketing frequency results must be interpreted
    in statistical terms time and distance correlation functions
    are established diurnal seasonal and geographic regularities
    are discussed a sharp maximum in occurs at the magnetic equator
    no well defined influence of the solar cycle has been found and
    only a very weak lunar tide effect observations of the
    variation of reflection coefficient with frequency have been
    made apart from the routine evaluations in temperate latitudes
    in about a third of all cases there is no partial reflection in
    other cases local variations of electron concentration are such
    that the peak value mean value ratio is between and higher
    ratios are rare at low latitudes the variation may be more
    important ionograms of different stations have been classified
    for transparency scatter angle of incidence and layer
    development diffuse echoes exist often near the magnetic
    equator in most cases ionization originated as a thin layer of
    constant altitude transitory downward movements are responsible
    for in daytime a cumulo cirrus cloud layer is a good model for
    ionization possible ionization processes are discussed
