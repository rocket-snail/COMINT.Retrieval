further experimental investigations on the nature of
    light experimental arrangements are described for obtaining a
    photographic record of the effect of a strong nonuniform
    electric field on a light beam a photometric record of the
    variation in diffraction due to such a field the deviation of
    the beam which occurs when the plane of polarization is
    perpendicular to the direction of the field is discussed in
    relation to the em theory of light
