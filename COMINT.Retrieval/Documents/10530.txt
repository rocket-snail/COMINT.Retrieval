the perturbation of an electromagnetic field by small
    deformations of a metal surface a general expression is derived
    for the perturbation due to the deformation if the deformation
    is slight this perturbation can be found by the usual method of
    quadratures the method is applied to the problem of the
    diffraction of a plane wave at a step the height of wich is
    small compared with from this the well known formulae of
    rayleigh for reflections from small and smooth irregularities
    are easily derived
