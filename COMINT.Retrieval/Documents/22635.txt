temperature compensating networks a generalized
    analytical design procedure is proposed for the realization of
    two typical temperature compensating bias networks employing
    thermistors for class b push pull transistor amplifiers a set
    of simple relations is derived for evaluating the network
    component values and restrictions are indicated on the choice
    of appropriate thermistors
