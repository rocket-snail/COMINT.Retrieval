the field along the axes of symmetry of equal semi
    infinite rectangular magnetic pole pieces the method of
    conformal representation is used the field along the axes of
    symmetry is calculated for a number of values of the ratio of
    the width of the pole pieces to the distance separating them
    expressions for the potential function are also given
