delayed electron emission from metals measurements were
    made on a w foil substituted for the usual photocathode in a
    multiplier cell emission was excited by bombarding with
    electrons and measurements were started min after the
    bombardment the foil being simultaneously heated at a
    controlled rate the emission temperature curve passed through a
    maximum between and emission was eliminated by prolonged
    heating at but was restored by exposing the foil to the
    atmosphere at and abrading it the results support theory
