lists of new acquisitions' a contribution to library
    publicity. in june 78 131 academic libraries were asked whether
    they issued lists of new acquisitions; the 116 replies received
    showed that 49 did issue such lists and 67 did not. suitable
    questionnaires were sent to each group; detailed analysis is
    given of their answers on aims behind list issue, list
    structure, target groups, production forms, costs, advertising,
    possibilities of use control, alteration processes, criticism
    against lists and possible alternatives to them. production of
    these lists is expensive and time consuming; each library must
    decide for itself whether it is worth producing them. if better
    use is to be made of the lists, more attention must be paid to
    the selection of material and target groups. in future,
    specific subject lists including non-commercial works will
    predominate over lists of general material and electronic data
    processing will be used increasingly in their
    production.
