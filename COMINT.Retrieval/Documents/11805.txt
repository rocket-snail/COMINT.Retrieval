audio-visual developments relevant to libraries. most
    academic libraries in west germany already have many
    audio-visual (av) aids at their disposal' microfilms, sound
    recordings in various forms, maps, posters and individual
    cubicles for listening to sound recordings. today the most
    important aspect of av aids in libraries is not the
    introduction of every available new av development into the
    academic library but the development of a media section in the
    library with special emphasis on particular departments within
    the library e.g. the music department. new developments such as
    viewdata, video, cable television and computer learning aids
    cannot be automatically integrated into libraries. various
    factors must be taken into consideration when selecting a new
    av aid for a library; the information value, economic aspects,
    and the amount of additional staff training which will be
    necessary to make full use of the aids.
