an electromechanical ac line voltage stabilizer
    description of a stabilizing unit having a short recovery time
    comparing favourably with that of commercial electronic devices
    a temperature limited diode in a bridge circuit is used to
    detect the line voltage variations and is followed by a phase
    inverter and a thyratron driving circuit
