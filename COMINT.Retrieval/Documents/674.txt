the electron distribution in the ionosphere over slough
    part quiet days the distribution of elect on density with
    height is calculated from records using an electronic computer
    the method assumes sumes that the curve increases monotonically
    and allows for the effect of the earths magnetic field the
    height of maximum electron density in the f layer is found to
    be considerably lower than previously supposed particularly in
    the summer and equinox months
