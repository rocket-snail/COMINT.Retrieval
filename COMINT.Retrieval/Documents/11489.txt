the current state of librarianship training for assistant
    librarians. in recent years training for the higher staff
    grades has undergone a fundamental reform. the number of
    library school graduates working in academic libraries has now
    increased. formerly, although all staff in academic libraries
    possessed university degrees, few of them possessed
    qualifications in librarianship. in public libraries, by
    contrast, most senior staff have librarianship qualifications.
    the new situation has been caused by legal changes, the final
    results of which cannot be predicted with certainty. at present
    there is a wide variety of courses available; the best balance
    of theoretical and practical training must be chosen. further
    consideration must be given to the joint training of librarians
    and documentalists and to the salaries of library school
    staff.
