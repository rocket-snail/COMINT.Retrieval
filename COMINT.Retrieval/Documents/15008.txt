do librarians fear professionalism?. paper presented at
    the national librarians association-sponsored programme at the
    michigan library association, 11 oct 80. argues that in the usa
    librarians have been unable to achieve the distinctive status
    of a profession. they have no way of making the claim stick
    that they have crucial skills and knowledge of vital importance
    to society. as a result they are an occupational group unable
    to increase significantly the economic well being and prestige
    of librarianship through traditional professional means.
    because of library associations' emphasis on the institution,
    there is a lack of concentration on what constitutes the
    professional basis for librarianship; the associations have
    created a situation where the librarian has occupational power
    without the growing social problems of professional
    power.
