the work function of irregular metal surfaces calculation
    of the image potential for spherical and spherical and prolate
    spheroidal bosses on an otherwise smooth surface h shows that
    this potential might be reduced to of its value for an ideal
    plane surface since the image potential is likely to form a
    large portion of the work function for most metals the work
    function will be significantly reduced when the surface is
    rough
