the origin of the ionospheric irregularities responsible
    for radio star scintillations and spread f part a theory is
    presented which attributes the occurrence of ionospheric
    irregularities in the f region to turbulent wind motion in the
    dynamo region at a height of km the resulting turbulent
    component of the electric potential field produced is
    communicated to the f region as suggested by martyn where
    magneto electric forces then cause the ionization to form
    eddies it is suggested that the absence of daytime
    scintillations is due to the inhibition of turbulent flow by
    large temperature gradients during the day the theory is then
    shown to explain the major features of radio star
    scintillations together with the long term correlation of
    scintillation amplitude with magnetic activity and the
    variation of spread f and scintillations at different parts of
    the earth over the sunspot cycle
