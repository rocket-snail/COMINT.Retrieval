synthesis of transfer functions by active networks a
    criterion is presented for determining whether a prescribed
    transfer function can be synthesized by this means the
    arbitrary function can be treated by breaking it down into
    quadratic elements alternative methods involving inversion of
    the transfer function of a ladder network realization are also
    discussed
