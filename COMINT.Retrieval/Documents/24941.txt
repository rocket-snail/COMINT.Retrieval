a knowledge-based literature guide system-a new approach
    to document retrieval. presents a new approach to document
    retrieval based on a semantic model for natural language. the
    content of a document is represented using the hierarchical
    model of knowledge representation, its sentences being
    translated into logical representations which are integrated
    into the knowledge base as an organised knowledge structure.
    queries are also in natural language, from which retrieval
    commands are automatically generated. answers are synthesised
    from the results of retrieval. a working system called lgs
    (literature guide system) has been constructed. this can answer
    questions based on the integrated abstracts of scientific
    literature. examples using lgs are presented.
