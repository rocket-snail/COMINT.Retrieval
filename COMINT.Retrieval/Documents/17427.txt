collecting national and international data on the
    production of audio, visual and microform materials. this paper
    reviews unesco activities for the collection of national
    production data of audio-visual materials and microforms and
    presents possible approaches to the task. unesco has for some
    years collected data on the production of printed materials,
    but while recognising the need for collecting similar
    statistics on nonprint media, it has not yet done so. if unesco
    were to undertake the task, it would be necessary to enlist the
    aid of international associations and the national associations
    of producers of these materials. report not available from
