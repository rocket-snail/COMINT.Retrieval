contribution to the theory of the molecular generator the
    resonance interaction between an electromagnetic field and a
    molecular beam and self oscillatory processes in a molecular
    oscillator are investigated for the case of a single velocity
    beam results obtained taking account of nonmonochromatic
    molecules in the beam are considered qualitatively
