a new transformerless amplifier circuit four valves in a
    bridge circuit are driven in appropriate phase and amplitude so
    as to deliver equal power to a common load no dc flows through
    the load negative feedback is easily applied a and an amplifier
    are described response characteristics are flat over the audio
    range at all levels of operation the unit weighs including
    power supply and pre amplifier
