some transistor input stages for high gain dc amplifiers
    several types of input stage are investigated and methods of
    reducing drift are suggested it is shown that drift of
    operating point in transistor dc amplifiers depends on the type
    of circuit the lowest drift being obtained using the transistor
    as a chopper
