in search of 'eternal' problems; young people and the
    classics: the conditions for understanding. library fiction
    issues comprise 2.5% of total issues, classics amounting to 5%
    of this. importance of promoting classical fiction is
    undervalued. children read classics as part of the school
    syllabus but bid farewell to them on leaving. classical
    literature's role in education is underestimated because of
    feelings that children are too young to understand them or are
    not interested. children should be taught how everything
    'interconnects' in russian literature, which asks the same
    eternal questions as 'moderns'. russian classics ought to
    become indispensable to young people's lives. schools and
    libraries must familiarise children with the classics,
    combining towards their intellectual development.
