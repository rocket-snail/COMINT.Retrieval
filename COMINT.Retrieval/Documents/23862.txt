an energy-conscious library building in katwijk. on 14
    dec 80, a new branch library was opened at katwijk in the
    netherlands. during the planning stages it was felt that a
    building with a public function, such as a public library,
    should set an example in energy saving. to maximise natural
    energy from the sun the building has been constructed with a
    large area of glass in the south-east wall; the warmth
    generated by this means is retained in the stone north wall and
    the floor. the building is equipped with triple-glazing and
    heat-insulating blinds which close automatically at night and
    reopen each morning. it is expected that the savings in energy
    costs will be in the region of 50%. it is to be hoped that
    other libraries in the netherlands will follow this
    example.
