new applications of impedance networks as analogue
    computers for electronic space charge and for semiconductor
    diffusion problems the general second order partial
    differential equation is transformed to the equivalent equation
    of finite differences and hence relations for analogue
    impedance networks are derived resistance chains are applied to
    the case of one dimensional high vacuum diodes yielding results
    within about of the exact solutions rc networks are applied to
    semiconductor diffusion with space and surface recombination
    giving some new results for pn diodes a plane resistance
    network applied to a triode with space charge gices the anode
