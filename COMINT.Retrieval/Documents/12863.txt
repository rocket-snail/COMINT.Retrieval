time management in libraries. presents the main points
    covered by peter quarry in a talk at a school library
    association of victoria (australia) south-eastern branch
    meeting, mar 81. presents 3 basic steps for more efficient time
    management in libraries' (1) audit (a diary detailing how time
    is spent for at least 2 days and preferably for a week); (2)
    analysis (as series of questions concerning time spent on each
    task, whether tasks can be delegated, whether tasks are given
    too much time or neglected completely-this should expose the
    enemy, time wasters); and (3) action (the aim being to
    eliminate time wasters, organise the available time
    efficiently, and delegate tasks where possible).
