transistor equipped light weight programme input
    amplifier type an amplifier for a portable sound recorder is
    described in the pre amplifier the microphone is matched to the
    first transistor via a transformer by use of current feedback
    in the first stage it is possible to connect without
    attenuation capacitance microphones with terminal resistance
    the second stage includes a feedback circuit providing
    equalization up to kcs the final stage is designed for an
    output of mw shifting of the working point due to internal
    heating is reduced by use of a special stabilizing
    circuit
