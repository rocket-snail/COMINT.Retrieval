a theory of distribution and variation of the ionospheric
    f layers a brief description is first given on the results of
    our recent studies which have led to the conclusions of
    inhibition of vertical ionospheric current enhancement of
    conductivity dynamo current and vertical drift of charged
    particles near the geomagnetic equator and suppression of
    daytime electron density of f layer caused by an upward drift
    of electrons the treatment is extended to the case of
    ionospheric storm accompanied with geomagnetic storm the
    comparison of the theoretical and observational results is made
    for the cases of undisturbed as well as disturbed states of f
    layer the agreement is generally good for undisturbed case but
    not quite satisfactory for disturbed case the mechanism of
    dynamo in the ionosphere is discussed and a hypothetical
    consideration concerning a wing system during a storm is
    given
