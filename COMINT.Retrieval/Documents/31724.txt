on the index of refraction in the ionosphere the forces
    acting on an electron in an ionized gas are enumerated it is
    confirmed that in the ionosphere the lorentz polarization force
    is annulled by the effects of electron ion collisions and that
    the refractive index is given by the sellmeyer formula at radio
    frequencies
