automated networks for canadian sci-tech libraries: still
    an anomaly?. looks at the state of networking activities of the
    science and technology libraries operating in the academic,
    private, and public domains of canada. a recent survey showed
    these libraries to be very involved with automation and engaged
    in various cooperative endeavours, both internal and external
    to the library's organisation. however, very few sci-tech
    libraries were found to be networking. some of the reasons for
    this are given and the implications for the future are
    explored.
