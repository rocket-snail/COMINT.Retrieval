a view from barbados. contribution to a section devoted
    to planning interlending systems for developing countries.
    interlending in barbados is assisted by the close proximity of
    the major libraries, which have good telephone links.
    international requests are routed via the university of west
    indies library to the blld for journals, but to a wider
    selection of libraries for monographs. the choice is difficult
    and time-consuming for monograph requests, and automated union
    catalogues produced in other countries could help in this
    respect. small collections of periodicals satisfy a high
    proportion of demand, but actual titles remain to be
    identified.
