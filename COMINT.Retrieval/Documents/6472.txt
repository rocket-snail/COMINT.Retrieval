on the edge of the desert' statement of achievements by
    the public libraries. the idea that increases in loans and
    stocks would bring about proportional increases in finance,
    accommodation and staff has proved incorrect. statistics on
    loans and stocks conceal weaknesses within a library and the
    unfulfilled wishes of readers. there is no prospect at present
    of a library law and salary negotiations have stopped. only 10%
    of the population use libraries' more dedicated librarians are
    needed to develop social librarianship. freedom in book
    selection is often threatened by the attitude of local
    officials and by conditions on the book market. public
    libraries in germany have developed not in a unified fashion
    but through a variety of historical causes. the best cure of
    these problems would be an open and critical dialogue between
    librarians and politicians.
