conservation and collection management' educational
    problems and opportunities. library and archival conservation
    has suffered from a lack of professional educational
    opportunities in the usa. its emphasis on apprenticeship
    training cannot engender a capacity for research, but the 4
    graduate programs in the usa and canada stress art conservation
    with its attendant focus on artifact restoration, rather than
    collection conservation in archives and libraries. although the
    national conservation advisory council has addressed this
    issue, a.l.a.-accredited library schools programmes have been
    slow to respond positively. recent efforts are discussed,
    especially the curricula at columbia university and the
    university of maryland.
