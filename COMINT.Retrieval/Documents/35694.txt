diffraction of microwaves by long metal cylinders report
    of an experimental investigation at about using parallel plate
    equipment based on that described by and cylindrical obstacles
    of transverse dimensions comparable with calculated and
    experimental results for circular cylinders are in good
    agreement and are used as a basis for studying diffraction by
    square and rectangular cylinders the method gives reliable
    information about scattering from obstacles of forms such that
    no exact theoretical solutions are available
