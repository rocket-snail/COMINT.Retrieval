a new type of interferometer for use in radio astronomy a
    new type of interferometer for measuring the diameter of
    discrete radio sources is described and its mathematical theory
    is given the principle of the instrument is based upon the
    correlation between the rectified outputs of two independent
    receivers at each end of a baseline and it is shown that the
    cross correlation coefficient between these outputs is
    proportional to the square of the amplitude of the fourier
    transform of the intensity distribution across the source the
    analysis shows that it should be possible to operate the new
    instrument with extremely long baselines and that it should be
    almost unaffected by ionospheric irregularities
