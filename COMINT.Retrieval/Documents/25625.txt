investigations of noise in audio frequency amplifiers
    using junction transistors noise factor measurements were made
    using various types of transistor in different circuit
    arrangements the influence of input termination and operating
    point are discussed results are presented graphically three
    distinct sources are identified shot noise and thermal noise
    are independent of frequency over the af band semiconductor
    noise varies approximately as noise properties of transistors
    and thermionic valves are compared
