oscillations in a plasma with oriented dc magnetic field
    the angular dependence of the double resonances representing
    coupling of a low energy plasma and cyclotron oscillations is
    studied for all orientations of the dc electric and magnetic
    fields using a nonlinear phenomenological approach conditions
    favourable for manifestation of these modes are
    indicated
