studies of the e layer of th ionosphere part
    electromagnetic perturbations and other anomalies departures
    from the predictions of simple theory in observed e layer
    behaviour are attributed to perturbations arising from the
    motor effect of the s system of currents flowing there the main
    effect is to raise near noon in low latitudes and reduce it in
    high latitudes the departure of from proportionality to and
    other anomalies are also discussed
