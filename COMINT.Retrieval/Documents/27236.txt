tidal oscillations of the lower stratosphere diurnal and
    semidiurnal variations of wind occurring in the lower
    stratosphere appear to be associated with solar tides the
    semidiurnal variation in the stratosphere is in phase with and
    of comparable magnitude to the semidiurnal variation at the
    earths surface the diurnal variation in the stratosphere is of
    similar magnitude to the semidiurnal variation
