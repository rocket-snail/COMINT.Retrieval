prestel to transmit colour photographs. british telecom,
    part of the post office, has demonstrated prototype picture
    prestel capable of displaying full-colour photographs,
    accompanied by text. this technology is already available to
    potential overseas purchasers of prestel and to companies who
    wish to offer private viewdata services. the late 1980s is
    probably the earliest date for the widespread introduction of
    picture prestel. details of design improvements are
    discussed.
