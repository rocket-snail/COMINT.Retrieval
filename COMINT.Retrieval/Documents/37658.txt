tracing some features of 2library journal1 over twenty
    years. summarises a content analysis carried out on a sample of
    12 issues of 2library journal1 from 1958 to 1980. data is given
    for number of pages per issue, total pages per year, one-year
    subscription cost and price per page. the 85 articles, which
    appeared in these issues, were analysed by subject matter, type
    of library described and characteristics of authors. concludes
    that one trend, is towards fewer articles occupying a smaller
    fraction of the total number of pages and the subjects are less
    concerned with library materials and administration and more
    concerned with professional organisations. another trend is
    towards a greater emphasis on advertisements and book
    reviews.
