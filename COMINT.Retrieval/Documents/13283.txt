    (covering 1974), the latter containing references to 1,837
    publications. material is arranged in 13 main subject groups,
    most of which are subdivided; there are alphabetical indexes of
    personal and geographical names. most of the material included
    is in russian, published in syktyvkar or elsewhere in the
    soviet union. reviews of material listed and also of earlier
    publications are included.
