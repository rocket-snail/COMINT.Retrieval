signal and noise characteristics of diode reactance
    amplifiers for the uhf region examples are given of mixer
    circuits straight amplifiers and a travelling wave amplifier
    using parametric amplifier techniques the problem of matching
    by means of nonreciprocal elements or by bridge circuit i also
    dealt with
