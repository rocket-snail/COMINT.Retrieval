a wonderful toy. the danish technical library at the
    danish technical university set up a data base in 1968
    containing locations of the library's own holdings. at the end
    of the 70s this facility was expanded to an on-line system of
    locating also other libraries' acquisitions and connected to
    scannet and euronet. describes a new development of the system,
    called alis (automated library information system), initiated
    in nov 81. it is now possible to requisition titles through the
    alis catalogues. these titles will be those readily available,
    as the library's loans will be registered in the terminal from
    1982. use of alis is free. the system, described
    diagrammatically, consists of a local system for administration
    of loans, and the i/s datacentralen's free text standard search
    system.
