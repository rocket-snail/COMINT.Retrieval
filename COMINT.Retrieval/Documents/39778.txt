the handicapped and music: the role of music libraries?.
    the disabled living foundation has worked closely with uk music
    libraries in recent years to provide an advisory service on
    music for the handicapped; danish music libraries are also
    active in this sphere. the 60 music libraries in germany have
    so far done little for the handicapped; they should obtain all
    available information from the uk and discuss with
    librarianship and government bodies the adaptation of the uk
    scheme for germany. the german library institute could organise
    a pilot project for 1983-84. topics to be considered include
    the provision of music in hospitals, day centres and schools,
    the use of musical instruments by the handicapped, the
    production of bibliographies, the improvement of special
    library services and employment possibilities for the
    handicapped in the music industry.
