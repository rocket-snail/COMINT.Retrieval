the temperature dependence of the capacity of the copper
    oxide rectifier the variation of the capacitance at the metal
    semiconductor boundary is calculated on the assumption that it
    is caused by the temperature variation of the free charge
    carrier concentration in the semiconductor the calculated
    results are compared with experimental results for the
    temperature range from
