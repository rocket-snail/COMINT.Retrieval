initial rise of brightness of electroluminescent
    substances under the action of an alternating field observed
    phenomena can be explained on the assumption of excitation of
    luminescence centres by conduction band electrons that have
    acquired sufficient energy these electrons reach the conduction
    band from electron donor levels a few tenths of an electron
    volt below and are then accelerated
