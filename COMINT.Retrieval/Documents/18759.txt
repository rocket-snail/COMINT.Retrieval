the reactance tube as a parametric frequency divider and
    amplifier derivation of the equivalent circuit of a parametric
    amplifier in which a reactance valve functions as a time
    varying inductance i if the signal source is removed the
    circuit will operate as a frequency divider where the output is
    a subharmonic of the pump frequency
