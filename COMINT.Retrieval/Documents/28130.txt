the control of self maintained discharge currents by
    illumination of the cathode the discharge characteristics of
    neon filled and photocells illuminated with a hg discharge lamp
    were obtained experimentally the magnitude of the controllable
    current in the townsend discharge space depends on the
    illumination of the cathode the driving potential applied and
    the value of the stabilizing resistance used
