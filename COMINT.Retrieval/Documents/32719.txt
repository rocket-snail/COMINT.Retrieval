information banks, data banks, and data bases' an attempt
    at clarification of terms. a paper presented at a 1980 canadian
    conference which derives a structural typology for information
    banks from the preliminary construction of typologies of
    documentary information and documentary elements. the 1st
    typology develops the relationship between information and
    documentary information; the 2nd leads to redefinition of the
    concepts of records, documents, and bibliographical entries.
    the creation of the information bank typology leads to
    explanation of the data base concept, and in conclusion a
    definition of documentation is advanced. the argument is
    illustrated by reference to canadian examples.
