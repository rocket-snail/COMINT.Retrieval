information on public documents. the annual bibliography
    of norwegian government publications (25th issue 1980) is
    surprisingly little-known to libraries and public institutions,
    considering the shortage of bibliographical aids to public
    documents. its scope has varied over the years; recently it has
    covered institutions listed in the norwegian government
    yearbook. it covers certain publications not in the norwegian
    national bibliography. entries are by institution, with dewey
    numbers and simplified bibliographic descriptions. part i
    (books, articles, annual reports and brochures; about 2300
    entries annually) has name and classified indexes, while part
    ii (circulars; about 1500 entries) has appeared separately
    since 1975. 1200 copies are printed, of which 600 go to
    subscribers and some 75 to foreign libraries. possibly all
    norwegian county and public libraries should receive free
    copies as an essential part of their information
    service.
