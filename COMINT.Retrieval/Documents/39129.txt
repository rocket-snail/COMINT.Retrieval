on the cherenkov radiation of dipole moments moving along
    an axial channel in a dielectric the radiation field is
    calculated for a magnetic and electric dipole moving in a
    dielectric if the radius of the channel then the radiation of
    the electric dipole moving perpendicularly to the axis
    increases by a factor of compared with the radiation in the
    dense medium of the dielectric
