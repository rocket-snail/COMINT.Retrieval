irreversible thermodynamics and carrier density
    fluctuations in semi conductors the formalism of irreversible
    thermodynamics is applied to the kinetics of carrier
    transitions in semiconductors the thermodynamic forces the
    generalized resistors and admittance functions are introduced
    it is shown that the thermodynamic forces which establish the
    regression of a perturbed state to equilibrium are the
    differences of the quasi fermi levels that have to be assigned
    to each group of carriers the generalized resistances are
    simply related to the transition rates the kinetic equations
    for the rate of change of the various carrier concentrations
    are then written in a unified form the spectral density matrix
    of the spontaneous carrier fluctuations being found from the
    admittance matrix the results are then expressed in a closed
    form which is valid for nondegenerate as well as for degenerate
    semiconductors the theory is applied explicitly to electronic
    noise in extrinsic and near intrinsic crystals with and without
    recombination centres
