tje practical calculation of transient response for
    arbitrary attenuation and phase distortion phase characteristic
    is determined from a given attenuation frequency curve by bodes
    method the locus of the complex transfer coefficient is
    approximated by fourier series the calculated coefficients are
    used to evaluate the response function for the case of unit
    pulse and unit step input as an example the transfer functions
    are determined for three different amplifier characteristics in
    a receiver the accuracy of the method in giving the general
    shape of the transient response curve is verified using
    samulons method an appendix contains formulae for calculating
    the fourier coefficients required and tables of the functions
    sin and sin applying in cases and respectively
