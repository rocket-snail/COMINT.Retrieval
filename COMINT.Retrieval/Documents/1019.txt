rc cathode follower feedback circuits when certain rc
    circuits are associated with a cathode follower circuit a
    voltage gain can be obtained over a band of frequencies a
    number of prototype and derived rc circuits which can be used
    in this way are analysed and their response curves are
    determined the matrices of the derived networks can be formed
    easily from those of the corresponding prototypes the effect of
    circuit termination on response is discussed and the use of
    these circuits as feedback elements in amplifiers is considered
    in some detail experiments in confirmation of the theory are
    mentioned
