documentation and literary research. a paper presented at
    a 1980 quebec corporation des bibliothecaires professionnels
    conference, distinguishing the information needs of the
    literary researcher from other user needs. discusses in detail
    the kind of documentation required, and shows how the notions
    of obsolescence and exhaustivity are largely irrelevant. to
    meet these specific needs, quebec should establish a union
    catalogue of research resources and a national research
    library; here the computer is not the solution.
