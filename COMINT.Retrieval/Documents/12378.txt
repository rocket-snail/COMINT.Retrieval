a note on the world wide distribution of the sporadic e
    ionisation a discussion based on data obtained during from
    ionospheric sounding stations of them in n america in
    geomagnetic mid latitudes the prevalence of e clouds is
    greatest in local summer daytime in the northern auroral and
    the equatorial zones no seasonal variation is apparent in the
    auroral zone there is a daytime belt of intense e ionization
    and in the equatorial zone one at night time these belts have
    different characteristics and appear to have different causes
    very marked variation with longitude has been noted
