the suppression of switching transients by a shunt
    circuit a detailed analysis is presented of the phenomena
    occurring when apparatus including shunt capacitance is
    suddenly switched across a low impedance source of power
    through a short transmission line conditions for the transient
    voltage in the shunt damping circuit to be nonoscillatory are
    deduced it is proved that the current through the switch can be
    made unidirectional numerical illustrations are given
