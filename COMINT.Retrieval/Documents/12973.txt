the valley effect in the interpretation of ionospheric
    eclipse records the spurious maxima in electron density curves
    at fixed heights can be explained by the presence of a valley
    between the f and f layers effect of annular solar eclipse of
    april at sunrise on the f layer of the ionosphere results are
    given of observations made at three stations in south india a
    marked decrease in ionization density with the progress of the
    eclipse was observed
