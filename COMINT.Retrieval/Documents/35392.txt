what an immigrant needs in the library. examines the
    library service to denmark's 100,000 immigrants. the 'quest
    worker collection' in gentofte library, set up in 1970, has not
    yet solved the problem of selection or acquisition of suitable
    material. best results have been achieved with activities for
    children. meetings between library staff and immigrants could
    improve services. information to the danes about immigrants is
    varied and should be acquired by libraries. but there is a lack
    of material in danish on the immigrants' home background and
    cooperation is hampered by lack of immigrant leaders. the
    library school has not yet taken the subject up. 2 reports from
    the library inspectorate (1973, 1980) come up with proposals,
    and an ethiopian born librarian, i. abdullahi, in his
    'description of immigrants and libraries in denmark' (1981),
    contributes to the debate. he lists the information from
    libraries which immigrants need and suggests ways of improving
    services, some of which need mo ney, others only improved
    personal effort and reorganisation of existing work.
