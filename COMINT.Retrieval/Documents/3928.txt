antiferromagnetism the nature of the spin coupling in the
    antiferromagnetic oxide mno is discussed on the basis of a
    simplified mode the coupling between magnetic ions whose charge
    densities interact i with an intervening nonmagnetic ion but
    not directly with each other is described as the result of the
    polarization of the nonmagnetic ion
