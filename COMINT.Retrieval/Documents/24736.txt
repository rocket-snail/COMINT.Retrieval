reaction concept in electromagnetic theory a mathematical
    definition is given of a physically observable quantity termed
    the reaction which is a measure of the force exerted by one em
    source on another the concept is used to obtain expressions for
    scattering coefficients transmission coefficients and aperture
    impedances the advantage of using this concept rather than the
    variational approach is illustrated by treating the problem of
    scattering by a dielectric body
