the work of a county department. contribution to an issue
    devoted to public library services in sweden. describes the
    work of sweden's jamtland county, which comprises 2
    provinces-jamtland and harjedalen. the county is about the size
    of denmark, but with only 135,000 inhabitants, 40% of whom live
    in the municipality of ostersund. distances between towns are
    vast. the ostersund library became the official county library
    in 1947. county department work varies from county to county,
    and comparisons show that swedish county departments work more
    flexibly than, say, finland's provincial libraries.
