microwave diffraction measurements in a parallel plate
    region diffraction of a plane or a cylindrical wave by wedges
    covered with silver foil was investigated experimentally by a
    probe method the wedge the line source and the probe were
    located between two large parallel duralumin sheets spaced in
    apart the measured values of field strength are compared with
    values derived from previously published theory
