observations of sudden ionospheric disturbances observed
    phase changes for reflected waves of frequency are possible due
    to an increase in electron density extending to above the e
    layer maximum measurements of the absorption of cosmic noise
    transmitted through the ionosphere show that an increase occurs
    at heights as low as km or even
