libraries in colleges of higher education. a decline in
    the uk birth rate, the assumption that few teachers would be
    needed and an attempt to broaden the base of education have led
    to the appearance of colleges and institutes of higher
    education, formed as many colleges of education closed and
    others merged with polytechnics and other institutions. the
    libraries are as varied as the colleges themselves, and a lack
    of published standards makes library planning difficult. with
    staff doubled or trebled by amalgamations there is a paramount
    need for professional staff to think seriously about the most
    effective use of staff and resources. the potential for
    training and educating a substantial number of the country's
    workforce in the ches is enormous.
