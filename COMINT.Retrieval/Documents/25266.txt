college librarians in india. contribution to a section
    devoted to india. exposes the attitude towards libraries in
    india as a whole although aimed primarily at the department of
    library science at the university of delhi in 1947, there has
    been no specialisation in the course content-there is no
    special course in college librarianship. the college librarian
    is still made accountable for every loss, and equality of
    status and pay with academic staff has not been
    achieved.
