the clinical librarian in the department of surgery. a
    subjective account of the service offered for 2 years by a
    clinical librarian in the department of surgery, guy's
    hospital. the librarians were based in the user environment and
    aimed initially to identify the information needs of the
    clinical team by attending ward rounds and meetings, to meet
    these needs immediately by providing selected documents in
    response to patient care queries, to build multidisciplinary
    document collections relating to specific patient care
    problems, and to make these available to other hospitals in the
    district. they aimed also to compile various publications based
    on the document collections and to emphasise the importance of
    teaching literature searching techniques particularly to
    clinical students and newly qualified doctors. discusses why
    not all these aims could be fulfilled and describes some of the
    factors which influenced the way the service developed in the
    department.
