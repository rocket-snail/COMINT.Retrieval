the charging and discharging of nonlinear capacitors
    capacitors with semiconductor photoconductor or electroyltic
    dielectrics involving space charge polarization are discussed
    and a formula is derived for the characteristic the charging
    and discharging processes in such a capacitor are compared with
    those for a capacitor in which is control voltage for the
    klystron reflector elec an increasing exponential function of
    the time variation of the differential capacitance of the space
    charge type during charging and discharging is investigated and
    is compared with the behaviour of a linear capacitor exhibiting
    a distribution of relaxation times
