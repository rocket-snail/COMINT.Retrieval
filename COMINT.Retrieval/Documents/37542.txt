the future, change, and planning for libraries' a new
    epoch of dark ages for libraries?. examines concepts of 'the
    future' and of 'change' contending that library planning must
    begin with identification of future developments in terms of
    the changes libraries are responding to, the sphere of concern
    and scope of time in which changes will take place, the impact
    of the changes, and significance of effect which new approaches
    will have. analyses what the user actually expects from a
    library service, suggesting that creative planning and
    innovative approaches to the utilisation of resources available
    to libraries are essential, if librarians are to avoid plunging
    libraries into a new dark age.
