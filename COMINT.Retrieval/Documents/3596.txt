a new dc level control for adaptive systems a novel
    electronic circuit is described and analysed which maintains
    the potential drop across a load constant to within a fraction
    of while permitting the dc level of the load to be varied
    through a wide range the circuit requires only standard
    tolerance electronic components and high precision is obtained
    by an error compensation technique
