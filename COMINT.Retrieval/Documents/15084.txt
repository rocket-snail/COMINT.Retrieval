transistor trigger circuits analysis is presented for
    transistor trigger circuits which permits prediction as to
    whether operation will be monostable bistable or astable
    oscillatory and also of the amplitude and waveform of the
    output practical pulse circuits for various purposes are
    described which are so designed that their operation is not
    affected by reasonable variations of circuit parameters bias
