a comparative analysis of information retrieval thesauri
    and normalised scientific and technical terminologies with the
    aim of their coordinated development. analyses the specifics
    and results of the lexical processing of scientific and
    technical texts for the compilation of thesauri for information
    retrieval activities and for the unification of terminology.
    identifies methods for representing the meanings of terms in
    thesauri and terminological systems. proposes procedures for
    the correlation of thesauri construction and maintenance with
    terminological work, and the simultaneous solution of the
    problems of the 2 disciplines.
