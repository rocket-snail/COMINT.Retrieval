unpaid volunteers and professionals side by side. since
    the 2nd world war there has been a clear trend in the
    netherlands towards professionalisation in the social and
    cultural services. however, in the 1960s a reaction
    characterised by the growth of self-help organisations took
    place against the post-war bureaucratic society. with the
    sudden change in the economic climate and the rise in
    unemployment in the 1970s professionals employed in the social
    and cultural services came to resent the use of unpaid
    volunteers as a threat to their own positions. however,
    although voluntary workers in libraries may lack professional
    expertise they are often more socially-motivated than their
    professional counterparts. voluntary workers in libraries
    should be employed in demanding and useful duties but not at
    the expense of paid library staff.
