bypass and decoupling circuits in audio design the
    amplifier equation is put into a form which expresses the gain
    for ideal conditions of perfect bypassing and no reactive
    elements with separate terms taking account of the actual
    reactive effects these terms are evaluated for the limiting
    conditions at the low and high ends of the frequency band and
    the real and imaginary parts are separated design of triode and
    pentode circuits is considered
