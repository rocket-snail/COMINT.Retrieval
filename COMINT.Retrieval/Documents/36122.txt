influence of insulating films on the corona current and
    breakdown voltage of spark gaps experiments are reported in
    which a point to plate discharge path was used the plate being
    coated with lacquer or other insulator observed breakdown
    voltages are in some cases lower than with an uncoated plate an
    explanation of the results is presented
