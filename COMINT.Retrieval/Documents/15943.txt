what's to be done? measures for the development of
    comprehensive information and literature provision. the basic
    concept of the public library's tasks and duties in west
    germany must be changed; outdated standards are a hindrance.
    the concept should demand a fundamental unity of purpose agreed
    between local councillors and administration and provide tasks
    for the library without pedantic emphasis on theoretical
    niceties. the use of electronic data processing can assist in
    explaining the purposes and functions of librarianship to the
    administration. libraries must express the need for
    administrative reform through their staff associations. current
    plans for library development should be reassessed. federal
    ministries and advisory centres should be more closely involved
    with libraries and more use should be made of mass media
    publicity. surveys should be carried out on library use and
    large libraries should assist in the financing of library
    research.
