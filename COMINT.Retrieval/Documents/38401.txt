electric currents in the ionosphere part ionization drift
    due to winds and electric fields the motion of a cylinder of
    ionization of density differing from that of the surrounding
    medium tends to be such that the ionization density is greatly
    increased over part of its surface and diminished over another
    part the significance of this result in relation to sporadic e
    ionization and to long duration meteor trails is pointed out
    formulae are derived for the horizontal and vertical drift of
    ionization at all atitudes graphs are given which permit
    derivation of the true wind or field in a given ionosphere
    region from experimental observations of the drift
    velocities
