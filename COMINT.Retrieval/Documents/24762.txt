effects of electron electron interactions on cyclotron
    resonances in gaseous plasmas from the boltzmann fokker planck
    equation a set of equations is derived and solved numerically
    the results indicate that the real part of the electrical
    conductivity of the plasma power absorption is reduced by
    electron electron interaction at the peak of resonance and the
    width of resonance is increased
