amplitude limitation in oscillators an oscillator which
    includes two biased diodes in the grid circuit to limit
    oscillation amplitude is analysed amplitude of oscillation and
    harmonic distortion are calculated and represented by curves
    from these curves it is observed that oscillations can be
    modulated linearly no frequency modulation occurs during
    amplitude modulation and harmonic distortion is very low also
    the circuit is found to be adequate for high frequency
    stability the distinctive feature of the circuit is shown to be
    that the static conditions of the valve such as bias voltage
    and direct anode current are independent of the oscillation
    amplitude a practical circuit is described
