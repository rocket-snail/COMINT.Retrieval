a lick and a promise?: frans stein's interview with frans
    van de roer on the future of public library services. the views
    expressed in an interview with frans stein in bibliotheek en
    samenleving 8 (11) nov 80, 311-316 (see 81/3084), by frans van
    de roer, head of the library section at the dutch ministry of
    culture, recreation and social services represent a serious
    threat to the future of public libraries in the netherlands. in
    spite of government assurances that access to information
    should be available to all sections of the public, van de roer
    is clearly in favour of increasing membership charges for
    public libraries in an effort to reduce government spending.
    librarians must convince the authorities that public library
    services should be regarded as part of a national information
    policy and not as part of the local socio-cultural
    services.
