the ionosphere and artificial earth satellites two
    methods for investigating the ionosphere are briefly described
    the doppler shift of emitted signals and the observation of the
    times of radio rise and radio setting of the satellites from
    the difference between the optical and the radio observations
    of the rising and setting the electron concentration can be
    calculated
