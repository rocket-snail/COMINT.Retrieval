interaction of microwaves propagated through a gaseous
    discharge plasma experimental observations are reported on the
    interaction of and signals in discharge plasma produced in he
    ne ar kr xe and h gases over the pressure range mm hg pulse
    excitation being used the disturbing wave was pulse modulated
    and the wanted cw transmitted through the decaying plasma was
    detected by means of a cavity resonator the amplified envelope
    being displayed on a cro typical oscillograms showing the
    modification of the envelope of the wanted wave due to the
    pulsed disturbing wave are reproduced when a magnetic field is
    applied the interaction is observed at low signal levels for
    which no effect is found in the absence of the magnetic field
