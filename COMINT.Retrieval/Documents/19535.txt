transistor controlled magnetic amplifier a circuit is
    described in which the collector toroidal core this part of the
    circuit being completed via the secondary of a transformer
    primary coltage at and the load resistor back to the transistor
    base electrode with this arrangement output currents up to peak
    can be obtained in the load for emitter input signal currents
    peak complete response to a change of input signal is obtained
    in one cycle of the applied alternating voltage
