critical frequency variations twelve month running
    averages of f are plotted against twelve month running averages
    of the sunspot number for two stations in the northern
    hemisphere two in the northern hemisphere two in the southern
    hemisphere and one near the equator for the northern hemisphere
    stations the slope of the curve is less at the higher values of
    sunspot number for the southern hemisphere stations the slope
    is constant and for the equatorial station the slope varies in
    an intermediate manner these differences may be related to the
    differences in the annual variation of f in the various regions
    considered
