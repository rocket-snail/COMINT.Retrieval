a short modern review of fundamental electro magnetic
    theory the method of presenting concepts taking the inverse
    square law of force between magnetic poles or electric charges
    as starting point is recommended as stressing the symmetry of
    magnetic and electrical relations faradays laws of induction
    are discussed and maxwells equations are presented in terms of
    electric and magnetic flux density
