correlates of communication behavior in the research
    laboratory. (phd thesis-university of texas at austin.)
    explores the relationship between the selection potential of an
    individual as a source of information, and the 'nuclear'
    environment of that individual. the scope of the study is
    limited to scientific and technological information
    communicated between research scientists and research engineers
    in an r&d laboratory setting. results support the premise
    that there is a significant relationship between a scientist's
    'nuclear' environment and his selection potential as a source
    of sti. a multivariate model is designed for use in evaluating
    formal and informal communication networks in the
    organisation.
