continuing education of librarians through private study.
    report on a 2-year-scheme introduced by the central regional
    library in ruse, to encourage continuing education of
    librarians in the region through private study. initially, 75
    topics were offered, and 94% of full-time librarians took part
    in the scheme. even professional librarians with 10, 15 and
    more years of service were not excluded from theoretical,
    controversial and/or innovative themes. they also widely
    explored soviet periodicals and literature in russian. the
    attitude and response of beginners and some library assistants
    appeared to be less enterprising and enthusiastic, in some
    cases even formal. it is hoped, however, that their
    professional ethics will improve in future. regular meetings
    with their tutors, resulting in the inevitable exchange of
    views and opinions were of beneficial influence in the study. a
    positive evaluation of the scheme must be followed by further
    experimentation, searching and striving for improve
    ment.
