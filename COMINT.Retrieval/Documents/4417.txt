a stable voltage controlled logarithmic attenuator the
    variable impedance element is a triode operated so that the
    cathode impedance varies approximately inversely as the
    transconductance stabilization is achieved by the use of dc
    feedback with a suitable increase in loop gain design procedure
    is given for both high and low input types experimental results
    are discussed
