measurement-theoretical investigation of the mz-metric.
    develops a mechanism for describing and investigating the
    relation between (1) formal measures for evaluating the
    performance of information systems and (2) intuitive ideas, or
    viewpoints, about the quality of the systems. applies
    elementary viewpoints (formalised viewpoints on system output
    quality) to the mz-metric (a performance measure), discussing
    the measurement-theoretic problems attached to the mz-metric
    and the applications of the elementary viewpoints
    mechanism.
