transistor noise in circuit applications problems of
    linear circuits involving multiple noise sources can be handled
    by familiar methods with the aid of certain noise spectrum
    functions which are described several theorems of general
    interest in circuit work dealing with noise spectra and noise
    correlation are derived the noise characteristics of
    transistors can be described in terms of the spectrum functions
    for simple but arbitrary configurations of equivalent noise
    generators from these the noise figure can be calculated for
    any external circuit numerical results for a number of npn
    transistors are given in a table and many curves
