electron emission from metal surfaces after mechanical
    working measurements were made on various metals in gas at a
    pressure of about torr using an electron multiplier the
    surfaces were abraded with a steel brush within the vessel
    emission time curves are shown for pb ca al and na the activity
    of the elements is correlated with their position in the
    periodic system oxidation may be the cause of the emission but
    no explanation of the mechanism is yet available
