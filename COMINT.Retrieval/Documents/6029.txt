the university is a school of reading. students at the
    studencheskoe konstruktorskoe byuro aviamodelizma, (students'
    aircraft modelling construction bureau), start by reading the
    literature on a problem; the road to science starts in the
    library. the university course on students' educational
    research work inculcates the reading habit, independent work
    with books. for best results students should abstract the
    important parts of their reading, thinking it over unhurriedly.
    creative interaction with the text is most important. after
    lectures, the next stage is the library, following up points
    made in the lectures. tactful librarians help readers choose a
    book at their level of competence and, in a short conversation,
    can arouse strong interest in a book or, conversely, switch a
    reader over to an alternative choice.
