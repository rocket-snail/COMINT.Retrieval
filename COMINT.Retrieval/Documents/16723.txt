conductivity in copper at wavelengths measurements
    indicate that reduction of conductivity below the value is
    caused not only by surface roughness but also by the presence
    of surface layers having conductivity lower than that of the
    bulk material and by stress in the bulk material these effects
    can be overcome by etching and annealing or by covering the
    surface layers by a process involving oxidation and
    reduction
