revision of cataloguing rules again. the work being
    carried out by the committee for descriptive cataloguing must
    be seen on the background of international developments, such
    as ifla's work with isbd, aacr2, and scandinavian attempts to
    reach compatibility with international standards. the need for
    rules for the registration of different media, which aacr 2
    supplies, is pressing. but a direct translation of aacr 2 into
    swedish is not possible, as some points need discussion, such
    as aacr 2's restrictive rules for institutions and the
    differences between aacr 2 and some isbd variants. the
    committee hopes to present a manual in jan 82. the consequences
    of this should be elimination of differences in cataloguing
    rules for research and public libraries and more rational use
    of bibliographic material, both nationally and
    internationally.
