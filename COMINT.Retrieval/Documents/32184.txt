quantitative evaluation of the reference process. the
    quantitative evaluation of the reference process is discussed.
    a distinction is made between the behavioural outcomes of the
    reference process, and the causal factors that inhibit the
    delivery of reference service. data are presented on 16
    libraries that participated in a national study of library
    economics. data on behavioural and causal aspects are collected
    and analysed separately; group or composite values for the
    performance parameters are presented. these are transformed to
    provide independent measures of the performance of the staff,
    the collection, and the patrons. group values, together with
    the range and medians, are presented. the question of how the
    librarian's perception of success is related to the patron's
    perception, and to the validity of the answers provided, is
    discussed briefly.
