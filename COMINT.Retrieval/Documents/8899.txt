    devoted to information seeking patterns of selected
    professionals. summarises the interview findings of the 5
    papers in this special section. each individual has his special
    information needs and each works in a field in which current
    information is both essential and often hard to locate.
    co-workers are the most often consulted information sources,
    and libraries were rarely if ever used for on the job
    needs-perhaps there is little or no role for the library in
    this sphere for many workers. library staff, too, consult
    co-workers when planning the library's reference activities.
    potential users know what they need. librarians need to know
    the extent to which they can fill those needs.
