the diary of the human race: libraries in a troubled age.
    paper presented at library history seminar vi 'libraries &
    culture', austin, texas, 19-22 mar 80. libraries are an index
    to the culture within which they exist-providing a repository
    of what has been discovered, imagined or hoped, and serving as
    arenas within which people can grapple with present tasks and
    attempt to cope with the future. presents a brief historical
    review of the us library's role in cultural life, and
    highlights present and likely future difficulties in meeting
    that goal, as libraries are faced with inflationary pressures,
    the public's increasing use of television instead of books, and
    higher labour costs.
