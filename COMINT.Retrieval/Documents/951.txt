parametric amplifiers and cancellation of ferromagnetic
    hysteresis by orthogonal polarization measurements have been
    made on tubular samples of ni zn ferrites showing the effect of
    a uniform magnetic field parallel to the axis on the
    magnetization due to alternating current in a toroidal winding
    for a sufficiently high field intensity hysteresis becomes
    negligible and the magnetization curve tends to become linear
    this principle has been applied in the design of a variable
    inductance parametric amplifier operating at with a gain
    of
