learned societies and journal publishing. reports on a
    study of 500 uk learned societies. an initial discussion is
    given of the historical and present-day roles of learned
    societies and current perceptions of the relative roles of
    commercial and learned society publishers. characteristics of
    age, size and subject of uk learned societies are presented.
    the main focus of the paper is on the extent and nature of
    cooperation between learned society and other publishers. some
    30% of uk learned societies cooperate with publishers, to a
    much larger extent in science and technology than in the arts
    and humanities.
