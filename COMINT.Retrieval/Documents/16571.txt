children's culture in delhi. describes the children's
    book trust in new delhi, a publishing house for children, set
    up by yamuna shankar in 1957 with the aim of producing high
    quality, low priced children's books. books are published in
    english, hindi and 5 other languages; losses are financed by
    other printing business. the subjects are mostly indian
    mythology and history, and, recently, popular science. other
    activities include' writers' workshops, a magazine 2children's
    world1, drawing competitions for children, film festivals, book
    fairs, and a dolls' museum. the trust also runs a library with
    toys, games, and 25,000 books for children aged 5-16. the
    efforts of the trust are praiseworthy, but amount to little in
    a country where poverty and illiteracy prevail. more unorthodox
    media than the written word should be attempted.
