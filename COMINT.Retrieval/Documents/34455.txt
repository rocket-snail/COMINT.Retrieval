the lower e and d region of the ionosphere as deduced
    from long radio wave measurements an ionosphere model is
    proposed which is in reasonable agreement with experimental
    data during the day this locates the reflection region in the
    tail of the d layer around km height the ionosphere winds
    region in the nose of the layer centred on km and a region of
    minimum ionization density between the d and e layers at about
    km with electron density of about electrons cm
