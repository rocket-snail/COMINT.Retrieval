equivalence of library qualifications' problems.
    highlights the problems of lack of equivalence of
    qualifications obtained from library schools in the developed
    and developing countries and the barriers to the free flow of
    librarians between countries. presents findings of the
    commonwealth library association's (comla) working party on
    reciprocity of qualifications presented in 1975 and criticisms
    of its report at a comla seminar. discusses standardisation of
    courses internationally and suggests that comla should research
    standards for professional and sub-professional training, as
    well as school libraries, and should produce an updated list of
    schools reaching the required standards. also suggests that
    individual countries could set up committees to advise
    employers on foreign qualifications.
