community workers and information' from national
    resources to neighbourhood advice. the information requirements
    of community workers in the uk are examined from the
    perspective of the organisational and personal restraints which
    affect them. some local political difficulties likely to be
    encountered by community workers when obtaining and using
    information are considered as well as some limitations imposed
    through working with specific groups. 3 approaches to community
    worker involvement with neighbourhood information centres and
    the misconception underlying them are identified. a fresh
    approach is proposed to provision of a national information
    centre and regional resource centres for use by community
    workers.
