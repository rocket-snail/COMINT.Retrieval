an unusual subject library. describes a biology library
    for senior pupils in a grammar school. the library is open all
    morning; pupils may come in freely to study, borrow books and
    photocopies and examine specimens. they can make coffee there
    and chat to their friends. although the pupils themselves are
    responsible for issues, very few books have been lost. there
    are about 500 books, including reference books and textbooks,
    frequently with multiple copies. in 1979-80, 150 senior pupils
    borrowed, on average, 4 books each. general school libraries
    should be divided into subject libraries run by departmental
    heads. these libraries should be small, clearly arranged and
    freely accessible.
