does current affairs documentation increase library use?.
    in modern society where people wish to participate in the
    decision-making process it is essential that the public have
    access through libraries to information on all matters
    affecting their lives. for this purpose collections of material
    relating to matters of current, social concern should be formed
    in local libraries. however, material of this nature is often
    difficult to obtain and to organise. in addition, since the
    useful life of such material is often short, the librarian must
    ensure through careful publicity that the collection is used as
    heavily as possible. in the netherlands the nederlands
    bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and
    literature) plans to organise a meeting in 1982 for librarians
    to discuss the organisation and exploitation of such
    collections in public libraries.
