corpuscular streams solar emission of particles giving
    rise to variations of the geomagnetic field of is discussed if
    the stream of particles is borne in the wake of a shock wave
    with a velocity of the order of complete transport of material
    from the sun to the earth need not be postulated the steep
    nature of the shock front is consistent with the sudden
    commencement of magnetic storms
