a note on the network postulates kirchhoff law that the
    sum of the potential differences about any closed path of
    branches is zero is repl ced by a version making no explicit
    references to paths of branches the resulting law can be
    interpreted geometrically in terms of orthogonal subspaces of a
    certain vector space the network definition given is readily
    shown to be invariant under changes of basis the equivalence
    between the new definition and the classical one is
    established
