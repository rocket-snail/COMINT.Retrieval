on the world wide disturbance in f region the average
    disturbance in the value of f during magnetic storms is
    separated into the short time part and the local time part d
    these were calculated in the cases of typical storms from data
    obtained from stations in the northern hemisphere both their
    range and phase are correlated with the magnetic activity the
    phase of d during the active stage of the magnetic storm is
    almost entirely dependent on the local time but after the
    cessation of activity the disturbance moves with the rotating
