sideband correlation of lunar and echo satellite
    reflection signals in the range measurements are described and
    records of signal variation are illustrated with lunar
    reflections a correlation of was obtained between sidebands
    with separation the correlation of signals reflected from echo
    baloon with sideband separation was better than that of lunar
    reflections with separation
