hall effect in impurity conduction the existence of a
    nonvanishing hall effect in the impurity conduction regime of a
    semiconductor is demonstrated the theory is based on a three
    site transition process and in particular on a magnetic field
    dependent contribution to the jump probability between two
    sites
