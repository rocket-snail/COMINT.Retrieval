serial acquisition as a capital budgeting problem.
    examines the costs and benefits of purchasing periodicals on a
    1-year versus a 3-year subscription basis. the decision problem
    is viewed as a capital budgeting problem where the objective is
    cost minimisation over a 6-year time span. the variables
    considered critical to the decision include cost of capital,
    subscription reorder cost facing the library, annual rate of
    change of subscription rates, and ratio of 3-year to 1-year
    subscription costs. the model was developed and applied with
    the assistance of library managers at the university of
    rochester. results of the study indicate that, even under those
    conditions most favourable to maintaining a 1-year subscription
    policy, substantial savings can accrue by shifting to a 3-year
    subscription policy.
