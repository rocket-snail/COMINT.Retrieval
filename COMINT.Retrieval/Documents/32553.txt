library systems analysis 1: the objectives. examines the
    steps involved in drawing up a statement of objectives for a
    library system as a preliminary to carrying out an analysis of
    the system. discusses the definition of: internal objectives,
    which are determined by interviewing, job analysis, flow
    charting, and the development of decision tables; and external
    objectives, which are concerned with the efficient organisation
    of the 3 main library functions-collection, storage, and rapid
    retrieval of material.
