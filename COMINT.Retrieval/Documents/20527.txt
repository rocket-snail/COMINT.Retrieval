on asynchronous action an analysis is made of quenching
    and excitation of oscillations by an external oscillation of
    unrelated frequency the excitation depends only on the transfer
    of the position of equilibrium across the bifurcation point in
    the stability diagram and is hence observed only in hard
    systems whereas quenching can occur in hard and in soft
    systems
