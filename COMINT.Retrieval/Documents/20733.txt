effect of temperature on photo voltaic solar energy
    conversion theoretical investigation of the behaviour of
    materials with band gaps varying over a temperature range show
    that the best conversion performance is obtained for the ideal
    junction current it is degraded by the presence of
    recombination current experimental data are given for si gaas
    and cds cells and are compared with theoretical
    expectations
