production of radio waves by means of the tcherenkov
    effect the tcherenkov effect consists in the emission of em
    radiation by a particle travelling through a medium with a
    velocity greater than that of light the essential results of
    frank and tamms theory of the effect are quoted and references
    given to accounts of experimental verifications of the theory
    using electrons and also protons the possibility of producing
    em waves in he range between the far infra red and uhf by means
    of the effect in a narrow channel is discussed it is concluded
    that intense sources of em waves should result from the ue of
    powerful beams consisting of packets of electrons simple
    arrangements should suffice for cm a and mm waves but
    difficulties will certainly be experienced in the case of still
    shorter waves
