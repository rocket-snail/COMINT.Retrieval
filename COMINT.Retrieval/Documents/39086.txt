cataloging contributed to oclc' a look one year later.
    research libraries face difficult choices in establishing
    technical services processing priorities, especially in the
    selection of items to receive original cataloguing. the author
    designed a study to examine the disposition, 1 year after
    input, of a sample of original cataloguing contributed to the
    oclc data base by the indiana university, bloomington,
    libraries. findings indicate that most original cataloguing
    contributed by this library was not superseded or duplicated by
    library of congress cataloguing and that many items were not
    catalogued by any other oclc member library.
