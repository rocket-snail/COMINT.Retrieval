the british library' phenomenon of the seventies or
    prototype of national library planning. in its legislation, the
    composition and powers of its board, and its understanding of
    the role and responsibilities of a national library in the 70s
    and beyond, the british library might justifiably be deemed a
    prototype of modern national library planning; but since it
    began from a vantage point not accessible to other existing
    national libraries in the developed countries (and beyond the
    reach of those in developing countries), it may be viewed
    rather as a phenomenon of the 70s.
