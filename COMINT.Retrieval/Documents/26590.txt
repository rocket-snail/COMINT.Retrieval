resonant cavity measurements of the relative permittivity
    of a d c discharge measurements at and on low pressure d c
    discharges in a mixture of hg vapour alone decrease of
    permittivity with increase of discharge current was noted in
    all cases in case the cavity q factor exhibited a minimum at a
    value of discharge current depending on the resonance frequency
    this is attributed to electron resonance theory of the method
