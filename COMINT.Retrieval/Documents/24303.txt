a conductivity storage transistor pulse width modulator
    transistors of both point contact and junction types exhibit in
    certain pulse applications prolonged conduction generally
    ascribed to hhole storage this can be controlled in a circuit
    to provide a simple means of pulse width modulation for time
    division multiplex the technique is described for use with
    selected point contact transistors
