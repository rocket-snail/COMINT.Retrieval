in the iron age of cataloguing. cutter described the 19th
    century history of cataloguing as the golden age. extends this
    metaphor to the 20th century to elucidate current trends in
    cataloguing, especially those involving the use of the
    computer. does the automation of the catalogue represent a
    technological advance that will free us from the difficulties
    of main entry and provide for cutter's 2nd object? argues that
    the cataloguing tradition of panizzi, cutter, and lubetzky will
    be even more valid, and that a better understanding of the
    principles of cataloguing will be required in the
    future.
