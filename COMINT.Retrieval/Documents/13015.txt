graphical analysis of nonlinear circuits using impedance
    concepts approximate values of the reactance of moderately
    nonlinear inductors and capacitors are obtained by adding to
    the usual linear expressions terms involving the square of the
    current using this approximation the total impedance of an lrc
    circuit is obtained and plotted in the iz plane with frequency
    as a parameter the method gives a physical picture of the jump
    phenomenon in nonlinear circuits
