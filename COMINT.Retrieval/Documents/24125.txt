vector modifications inherent in the doppler effect for
    waves propagated in a dielectric medium the propagation of
    plane em waves in a moving medium is characterized by four
    vectors as compared with two for a stationary medium because
    the directions of the electric and magnetic fields no longer
    coincide with the respective inductions relations between these
    vectors are derived and their physical significance is
    discussed
