correlation between the mean level of atmospherics and
    the degree of intelligibility in a kilometre wave radio link
    measurements made on june at the laboratoire national de radio
    electricite using a wavelength of are reported the signalling
    speed was words min and the signal strength at the receiver a
    vertical aerial was used and atmospherics were received
    simultaneously with the signal the numbers of wrong or
    indecipherable figures and letters received are indicated on a
    graph of mean field strength of atmospherics plotted against
    hour of day good correlation is observed
