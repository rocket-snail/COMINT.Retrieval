system of imprints. report and proposals. a description
    of a franco-british project of 15 years' duration to develop a
    formula for matching all copies of the same edition, for use in
    compiling an automated union catalogue of old books. the agreed
    method is described in detail, with examples of cases where it
    applies easily, and a report on research to establish the
    incidence of fallibility, and possible solutions. the function
    and application of the formula in cataloguing is demonstrated,
    with proposals that its use be extended to complement
    traditional cataloguing practice and show the history of a text
    by establishing 'families of imprints'. the guide for users, to
    be published shortly, is reproduced in an appendix.
