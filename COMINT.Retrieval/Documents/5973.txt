the p.a. tiele school of librarianship and the handbook
    of librarianship and documentation. during feb 81 staff of the
    p.a. tiele school of librarianship in the hague, netherlands
    discussed the use of 2bibliotheek en documentatie' handboek ten
    dienste van de opleidingen1 (2libraries and documentation' a
    handbook for students1) 2nd edition, 1979 as a teaching
    instrument. the handbook is used at the school as a basic
    introduction for students to a number of course subjects.
    however, inadequate coverage of a number of topics and the use
    of specialised terminology make the work unsuitable for use as
    a student textbook. in addition, the text of the book, which
    was written by several authors, suffers from a lack of balance
    and is further marred by an inadequate index.
