a stable gain transformer coupled transistor af amplifier
    the amplifier is designed primarily for use with dc choppers
    giving a square wave output at cs circuit diagrams are given
    and the performance is illustrated by graphs changes in the
    transformer design for use at other frequencies are
    discussed
