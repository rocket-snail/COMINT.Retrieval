regional cooperation for development of medical
    information service. the japan medical library association is
    the most powerful association of special libraries in japan. it
    owes much for its development to the usa and europe, and as
    such has virtually no contact with medical libraries in asian,
    and particularly southeast asian countries. whilst the
    southeast asian medical information center (seamic) held its
    1st workshop in tokyo in 1973, the problem of the variety and
    complexity of the region is a barrier to the establishment of a
    network of libraries in southeast asia. only by removing these
    barriers and establishing strong regional cooperation, can
    information be exchanged freely, which will be a sure step in
    the development of medical information.
