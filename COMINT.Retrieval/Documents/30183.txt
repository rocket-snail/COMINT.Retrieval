agc by means of miniature ntc resistors with heating
    element the negative temperature coefficient resistors are
    surrounded by the heating element and enclosed in an evacuated
    glass tube the resistor being included in the input circuit of
    an amplifier and the heating element in the output circuit to
    obtain efficient agc practical circuit details are given and
    operating characteristics of the ntc resistors are shown
