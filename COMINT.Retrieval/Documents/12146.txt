electron spin and phonon equilibrium in masers it is
    pointed out that the successful operation of in three level
    steady state masers is incompatible regardless of the operating
    frequencies of the maser with the assumption that the
    relaxation rates are determined by the interaction between the
    lattice vibrations and the helium bath
