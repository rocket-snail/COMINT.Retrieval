cost-effectiveness of soviet serial exchanges. while the
    traditional view has been that soviet publications were best
    acquired through exchanges, a recent review of soviet serials
    at duke university library suggests that this may no longer be
    as true as it once was. the availability of soviet publications
    through normal trade channels has increased in recent years.
    because of this fact, the importance of maintaining equitable
    exchanges in economic terms has increased. our examination has
    shown that it should not be assumed that such exchanges are
    equitable. regular reviews are recommended to serve the needs
    of libraries best.
