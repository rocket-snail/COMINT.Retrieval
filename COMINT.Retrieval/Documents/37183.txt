the frequency response of a certain class of nonlinear
    feedback systems a method is described for predicting the
    frequency response of feedback systems including one single
    valued nonlinear element followed by a low pass filter the
    conditions giving rise to gain discontinuity or jump phenomenon
    are investigated experimental results obtained with an
    electronic servo simulator justify the use of the analytical
    technique
