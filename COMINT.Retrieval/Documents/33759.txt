effect of geophysical factors on the motion of a
    satellite the orbital calculations based on the use of
    differential equations in terms of elliptical osculating
    elements depend on the accurate estimation of geophysical
    factors such as air resistance and gravitational anomalies the
    determination of these factors from satellite observations is
    considered
