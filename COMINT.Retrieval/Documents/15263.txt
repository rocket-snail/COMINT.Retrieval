multiple element interferometer for locating sources of
    solar noise at the interferometer uses five aerials each with a
    paraboloidal reflector of diameter arranged at intervals of m
    the distribution of brightness observed at over the quiet sun
    is consistent with the conclusions that the diameter of the rf
    disk is about greater than that of the optical disk and the
    outer ring is about times brighter than the optical disk of
    uniform temperature about
