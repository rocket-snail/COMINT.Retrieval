propagation in electron ion streams mathematical theory
    is developed for streams composed of n discrete beams the
    solution of the propagation equations is obtained in vector
    form by an extension of hansens theory and takes explicit
    account of initial and boundary conditions when certain
    restrictions are placed on the transverse boundary conditions
    the general solution satisfying arbitrary initial conditions
    can be expanded in terms of a complete orthogonal set of
    elementary vector solutions for this case the necessary and
    sufficient conditions are found for amplification and
    instability in the terminated and the unterminated stream the
    analysis is extended to a continuous velocity distribution see
