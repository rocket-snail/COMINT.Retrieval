tuned circuits containing negative resistance analysis
    indicates that the combination of a current controlled negative
    resistance with a parallel tuned circuit or of a voltage
    controlled negative conductance with a series tuned circuit
    yields a bistable circuit rather than a self sustaining
    oscillator
