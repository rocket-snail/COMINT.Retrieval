on-line, new aid in reference work, 2' computer searches
    for the business world. examines on-line systems in english
    public libraries on the basis of visits in connection with a
    conference on on-line information in public libraries held in
    sept 81. luton central library has found that availability of
    on-line search methods has increased use of their reference
    service by businessmen and hospital medical staff in
    particular. hertfordshire county library installed a terminal
    in 1975 and carried out on-line searches; as a result it was
    able to cancel subscriptions to some reference works. in 1981
    it acquired an scl microcomputer for accession and issue
    control. birmingham central library has a terminal in the
    technical reference room, with access by all departments, but
    not the public. it regards the on-line service only as an
    additional reference tool. none of the libraries undertook
    computer searches of their own stock, but only in international
    data bases. librarians found that search effic iency increased
    if users were interviewed first, but not present during the
    actual search, and that those carrying out the search should be
    experienced reference librarians specialising in a particular
    base. raises the question of the effect on publication of
    reference works in paper editions of the growth of on-line
    search facilities. (for part 1 2see bibliotek 70 1(17) 1981,
