resistance capacitance networks in amplifier design two
    types of rc network are distinguished the first of which
    includes all networks with a simple series or shunt capacitor
    this type only is considered frequency and phase
    characteristics are derived and reduced to simple graphical
    form impedance matching and loading effects are discussed
    typical equalizer and tone control circuits are examined
