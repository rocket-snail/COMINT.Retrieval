effect of surface roughness on losses in microwave
    resonant cavities measurements of value were made on a
    cylindrical mode cavity specially designed so that the internal
    surface could be treated in various ways eg by plating or
    polishing the magnitude of the discrepancies between the
    measured values and those calculated for a perfectly smooth
    surface depends on the dimensions of the surface irregularities
    and is very small when the surface unevenness is no greater
    than the skin depth
