a simple electronic multiplier the multiplication process
    described is based on the equation xy a method of squaring is
    used which depends on the fact that the areas of similar
    triangles are proportional to the squares of their heights a
    triangular waveform generator is described the device accepts
    both positive and negative input voltages
