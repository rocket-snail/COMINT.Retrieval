on the faithful reproduction of the flat top of a pulse
    in a high fidelity pulse amplifier the pulse amplifier analysed
    comprises a pentode with rc coupling circuits two methods of
    determining anode current and hence amplifier response are
    applied the one based on the overall amplification reduction
    due to voltages across the parallel rc screen circuit and the
    rc cathode circuit the other based on the superposition
    principle correction of pulse top distortion is achieved by the
    anode supply rc decoupling circuit the conditions for
    satisfactory correction are derived
