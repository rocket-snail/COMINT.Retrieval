the handicapped and libraries. the handicapped are
    dependent on the general public for spreading knowledge of
    available aids and the role of libraries. society creates the
    handicap by making activities unavailable. it is therefore the
    responsibility of society and individuals to see that obstacles
    are removed not just to better living conditions, but also to a
    full cultural life for the handicapped. the demand for
    information on material for the handicapped available in
    libraries was shown in a campaign led by kalmar regional
    library to be growing among teachers trying to integrate the
    handicapped in schools. staff within the social institutions
    can also act as links between the handicapped and the library.
    the regional library must stimulate local libraries to initiate
    domiciliary services and establish systems for lending of
    speaking books and personal contacts with users. the mass media
    and special teachers are other means of reaching the
    handicapped with information about library servi ces.
