microstrip applied to band pass microwave filters
    impedance measurements are made by connecting the microstrip
    line through a network to a waveguide or a coaxial slotted line
    characteristics deduced are phase velocity is constant over a
    wide range of frequencies wavelength in microstrip is greater
    than the value corresponding to a transverse em mode between
    infinite parallel plates approaching this value asymptotically
    for very wide strips the dominant mode propagated is not a pure
    transverse em mode the characteristic impedance of a microstrip
    line is approximately equal to the reciprocal of the product of
    capacitance per unit length and phase velocity the design of
    resonant sections by placing obstacles such as posts at proper
    distances is discussed in detail
