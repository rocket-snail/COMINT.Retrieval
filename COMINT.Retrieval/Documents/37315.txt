postcards are popular, but not in your library. presents
    the results of a survey of us and canadian public, academic,
    special and art museum libraries regarding collections of
    postcards-how they were organised, how updated and who, if
    anyone, used them. makes particular reference to art
    reproductions, mail art and artist's postcards. a list of
    libraries responding to the survey is appended.
