fluctuations of temperature accompanying the solar
    eclipse during the eclipse there was a depression of the rms
    value of the fluctuations which was accompanied by a
    temperature inversion with a steep gradient as the eclipse
    passed the maximum blackout period the rms value of the
    temperature fluctuations between two points vertically
    separated was found to increase with diminishing inversion and
    to continue to increase as the gradients changed from positive
    to negative values
