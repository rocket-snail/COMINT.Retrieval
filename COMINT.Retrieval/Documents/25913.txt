the compatibility of library systems. there are 2 ways to
    achieve system compatibility' develop or acquire an integrated
    system, or make the best of what you have to tie your current
    systems together. compatible systems can treat library data as
    an organisational resource, reduce data duplication, improve
    management information, reduce the overhead required for
    separate systems operations, and make conversion to future
    technology more feasible. planning for computer systems
    compatibility must be coordinated by the central administration
    of the library, who can referee departmental conflicts.
