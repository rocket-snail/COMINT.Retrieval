a correlation between the transient and frequency
    responses in servomechanisms statistical evidence is used to
    relate time and frequency response parameters these empirical
    relations together with a new theoretical relation for the
    delay time enable the step response to be sketched given the
    open loop response some nontypical closed loop responses may be
    broken down into two subtransient step responses which are
    separately determinable
