library censorship and the permissive minority.
    re-analyses a nation-wide survey of us adults conducted in 1970
    for the commission on obscenity and pornography to permit new
    comparisons of the large majority who favoured library
    censorship of 'erotica' with the minority who opposed it. as
    expected from previous studies, there were significant
    differences between the 2 groups-for example, those opposing
    censorship were younger, better educated, more open to mass
    media, and by a number of measures, more liberal or permissive.
    the anticensorship position appears to be part of a general
    liberal ideology that extends to such issues as racial
    integration and evnironmentalism. further, the anticensorship
    group has much in common with the group identified by other
    studies as users of public libraries.
