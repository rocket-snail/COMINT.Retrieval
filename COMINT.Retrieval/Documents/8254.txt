determination of the conservation time of periodicals for
    optimal shelf maintenance of a library. a method based on a
    constrained optimisation technique is presented to determine
    the time of removal of scientific periodicals from the shelf of
    a library. the problem is that of minimising shelf maintenance
    cost on the condition that the loss of the information is less
    than some specified rate. the solution obtained indicates that
    all the utilities of the periodicals should be equal at the
    removal time. a geometrical interpretation of the theoretical
    result is given. a numerical example is given to show how this
    technique is applicable to real bibliographical data.
