study of the ionospheric d region using partial
    reflections pulse echo observations were made with a
    transmitter of peak power and with the receiver located where
    the noise level was very low results showed that below the e
    layer there were two reflection regions a region of greater
    electron density around extending up to the normal e layer and
    having minimum ionization at noon a region around km where a
    distinct ionized layer forms during the day attains a maximum
    ionization at noon and disappears at night in echoes from this
    region both magneto ionic components were present the
    extraordinary being the stronger the ratio of the two magneto
    ionic components of a discrete echo at a particular range was
    within the uncertainty of observation independent of fading but
    varied with time of day and from day to day from this ratio the
    collision frequency and electron density for this range of
    heights were determined
