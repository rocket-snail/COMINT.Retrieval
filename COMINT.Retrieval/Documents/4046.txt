emergence into vacuum of the cherenkov radiation produced
    by longitudinal waves in a medium the em radiation of an
    electron moving into a vacuum from a medium with spatial
    dispersion is considered under certain conditions in addition
    to the transition radiation there is cherenkov radiation from
    longitudinal waves in the medium at large distances from the
    interface this radiation is a spherical wave confined to a
    narrow range of frequencies near the plasma frequency
