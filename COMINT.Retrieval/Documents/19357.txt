satellite telecommunications-some potential applications
    sti transfer. discusses the use of communications satellites as
    an example of potential changes in methods of disseminating
    scientific and technical information. it briefly reviews the
    basic relevant characteristics of communications satellites
    (bandwidth, very high data rates, multi-destination properties
    and small-receive-only earth stations). the work of cosadoc,
    set up by the european space agency to review possible
    satellite application areas in information transfer is briefly
    noted, including delivery of pictorial data (earth resources
    photographs), full-text document delivery with on-line browsing
    and data base distribution.
