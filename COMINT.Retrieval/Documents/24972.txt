nirrc spectrograms of a type of whistler observed at
    college alaska made by analysing tape recording the nose
    whistler a new high latitude phenomenons are reproduced and
    discussed the initial or nose frequency depends primarily on
    gyrofrequency hence such observations should enable the effects
    of gyrofrequency and plasma frequency on dispersion to be
    separated thus leading to more reliable estimates of the
    ionization density in the outer ionosphere
