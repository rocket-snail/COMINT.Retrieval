changes during the last ten years (1969-1978) in the
    academic library decision process for the placement and renewal
    of scholarly periodical subscriptions. an overview of the
    impact of funding restrictions on large us academic libraries
    during 1969-78. through most of the decade, the libraries
    relied on a series of strategies designed to minimise or hide
    their financial problems, shifting from monographic to serials
    expenditure and eliminating duplicates. only in the last few
    years have they been forced to turn to consortia and networks
    to alleviate the pressures on them. the libraries must face
    their problems squarely in the 1980s and produce leaders with
    the astuteness, courage, and persuasiveness to make faculty and
    administrators understand the problems. only then, within the
    framework of inter-institutional accord, will academic library
    cooperative activities move forward more rapidly and
    purposefully.
