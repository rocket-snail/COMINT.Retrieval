shoddy and pernicious books and youthful purity' literary
    and moral censorship, then and now. paper presented at the 41st
    conference of the graduate library school, university of
    chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access to services and
    materials in school and public libraries. though some
    librarians and teachers believe censorship is a recent
    phenomenon, it has been a part of librarians' lives for more
    than a century. indeed, many late-19th century librarians
    regarded themselves primarily as censors, duty-bound to protect
    the young from shoddy and pernicious books, especially fiction.
    some librarians and teachers today carry on this censorial
    tradition by circulating or teaching only works of high
    literary merit or the proper moral content. those censoring on
    literary grounds often provide only subjective criteria,
    justifying censorship by their own personal tastes. those
    censoring on moral grounds often provide no better criteria,
    justifying censorship by their own personal morality. libr
    arians and teachers have no right to impose personal literary
    or moral standards on the public, young or old. they have a
    duty to provide materials of all sorts to allow clients and
    students to search through and seek out ideas.
