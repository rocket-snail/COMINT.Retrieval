    dissertation-university of california, berkeley). an attempt to
    make some general observations about the manner in which people
    search for information which they know or believe to exist.
    analyses language and the development of a semantic theory that
    would help explain the process of inquiry; demonstrates that
    even such straightforward uses of language as authors' names
    and citations are very complex linguistic phenomena; analyses
    general methods used in the conduct of inquiry; and identifies
    and considers the major consequences of the pragmatic theory of
    inquiry.
