corpuscular radiation and the acceleration of artificial
    satellites observations of satellites and more accurate values
    of acceleration have been calculated at twice the original
    resolution of august correlation with cm solar radiation is
    higher for than probably due to greater observational accuracy
    an increased acceleration of at the time of two major
    geomagnetic disturbances following flares indicates the effect
    of corpuscular radiation on atmospheric density at the km
    level
