the influence of the solar radiation pressure on the
    motion of an artificial satellite results of theoretical
    investigations of the radiation pressure perturbation have been
    applied to orbital calculations for vanguard one producing
    significant perturbations in its perigee height in the case of
    a satellite with a large area mass ratio the major terms
    introduced by solar radiation pressure can reduce the perigee
    distance at the rate of km day
