on information equivalence of data bases. uses an
    algebraic approach to explain the concept of relational data
    bases. a query language based on predicate calculus, a query
    algebra, an algebraic structure on the set of classes of
    equivalent formulae, and a corresponding relational algebra are
    constructed. in terms of these, definitions are given for data
    base scheme and subscheme, the equivalence of subschemes of
    different users, and data base state.
