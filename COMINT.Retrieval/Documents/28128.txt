a simple microwave correlator the correlator described
    uses the ring modulator circuit as a rapid response multiplier
    it accepts signals on coaxial cables and has a wide frequency
    range two types those with positive and those with negative
    output pulse applications in the following computer circuits
    are described single ended electrical delay line store shift
    register circuits performing logical operations
