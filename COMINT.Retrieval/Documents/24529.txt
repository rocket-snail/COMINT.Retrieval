the future of the book' a historian's perspective.
    examines the future of the book in the academic library using a
    historical approach. its thesis is that there will be both
    continuity with the past and breaks with tradition, and that
    both forces will impact the future library. it distinguishes
    between cumulative and noncumulative knowledge and basic and
    applied research and concludes that knowledge in certain
    disciplines is best communicated using the traditional
    print-on-paper format, while communication of knowledge in
    other disciplines is likely to incorporate the newer
    technologies.
