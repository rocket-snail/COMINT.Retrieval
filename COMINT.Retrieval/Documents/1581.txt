the stability of relaxation oscillations synchronized by
    pulses a finite difference equation is derived for the pulse
    synchronization of relaxation oscillators solutions are
    obtained by a graphical method and possibilities of
    simplification are considered the procedure is also applied to
    the case of frequency division calculated parameters are
    verified by measurements on a multivibrator circuit
