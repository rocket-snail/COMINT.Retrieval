purchasing keys' methods of carrying out ideas on
    stock-building. much attention is being paid at present to
    stock-building problems, including the distribution of material
    within a public library network. working out stock-building
    principles can be time-consuming and this is only one aspect of
    stock-building, even if it is the most important. a purchasing
    key is a coding system for the practical application of these
    principles; experiences in magdeburg have proved the key to be
    a useful rationalisation method. through the coding symbols the
    librarian can see quickly what types of literature are in which
    libraries in the network. the symbols are flexible and can
    easily be kept up to date. other stock-building criteria are
    literary merit, specialist demand, functions of individual
    libraries in the network, numbers of readers, space and
    money.
