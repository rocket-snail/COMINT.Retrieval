incidence of an electromagnetic wave on a cerenkov
    electron gas analysis is presented for the interaction of an
    wave in a retarding medium with an electron gas moving through
    or near the medium at a velocity exceeding that of the wave in
    the medium for electron densities exceeding a critical value
    the gas acts as a mirror for the incident wave possible
    laboratory experiments for investigating the problem are
    outlined
