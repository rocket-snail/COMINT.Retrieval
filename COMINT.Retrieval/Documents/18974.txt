my wish is your command??. the increasing number of data
    bases and data bank suppliers has brought with it the problem
    that different host computers must normally be accessed using
    different command languages. many of these languages bear
    relationships to one another, by virtue of common ancestry,
    common design philosophy, etc. even so, the same language can
    be implemented differently by 2 suppliers. different
    implementations and/or languages must be considered by on-line
    users before contracting with a host. the consequences of
    learning a new command set, buying additional manuals, and
    attending extra courses are all economic ones, and are
    particularly relevant when a data base is offered by several
    suppliers.
