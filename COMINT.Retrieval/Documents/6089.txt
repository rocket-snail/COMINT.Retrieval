tunnel diode one sho and triggered oscillator th one
    tunnel diode flip flop described by kaenel of june which
    requires a bidirectional pulse can be made to operate as a
    triggered oscillator the switching mechanism of the schmitt
    trigger circuit using transistors equivalent circuits and
    characteristic curves ar derived results of measurements are
    given for comparison by the addition of an identical circuit
    with modified bias
