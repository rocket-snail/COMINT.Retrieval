reduction of the cathode fall of a normal glow discharge
    by illumination of the cathode experimental results indicate
    that the relation between the normal cathode fall the cathode
    work function and the current density due to illumination is
    given by where is constant whose magnitude depends on the
    ionization potential of the gas and i another constant a
    special based cathode with and adsorbed layers was used
