a term weighting model based on utility theory. 3
    information retrieval term-weighting models (inverse document
    frequency, term discrimination value, and term precision) are
    described and related to one another using utility theory as an
    evaluation model. demonstrates that all 3 lead to the same
    conclusion' when term independence and binary indexing
    (non-weighted) are initially assumed, the most important terms
    exhibit medium frequency and the worst ones are the high
    frequency terms.
