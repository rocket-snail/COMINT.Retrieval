analysis of transmission line directional couplers five
    different types of transmission line systems are analysed and
    are shown to possess directional properties at the lower radio
    frequencies the conditions of mismatch on either transmission
    line or on both transmission lines have been taken into account
    as well as lengths of coupling greater than a fractional
    wavelength a new and more general scatter matrix for
    directional couplers which includes the condition of mismatch
    is developed in addition lumped circuit directional couplers
    have been developed as a consequence of the general
    transmission line theory
