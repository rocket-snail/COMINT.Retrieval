movement of the f region using three spaced receivers
    continuous recordings were made in massachusetts during the
    period august december of a vertical incidence and two oblique
    incidence pulse transmissions the base lines for the latter
    being km and km in directions roughly we and nw se horizontal
    speed and direction of winds in the f region were determined
    from the time displacement of echoes at an average virtual
    height of average speed was and mean direction nearly parallel
    to the earths magnetic field monthly averages of mean direction
    showed a semiannual period with maximum deviation e of n around
    the equinoxes monthly verages of speed varying between nd sh w
    d n annual period with higher values in winter than in summer
    speed increased with height
