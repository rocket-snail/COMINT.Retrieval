low frequency plasma oscillations theoretical
    consideration of plasma comprising both electrons and ions with
    maxwellian velocity distributions shows that in the absence of
    an external field the low frequency plasma oscillations decay
    in the presence of an applied electric field undamped
    oscillations are possible
