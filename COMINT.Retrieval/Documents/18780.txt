reference retrieval without user query formulation.
    describes a computer program for the purpose of satisfying
    incompletely defined user needs through a man-machine dialogue
    which does not require a query formulation by the user. the
    program attempts to satisfy the user's needs from a model which
    it builds of his interests; a model which is a subset of its
    own world model (the data base). explores the possibilities of
    the program creating virtual world models to prevent the need
    for unnecessarily accessing the whole data base and
    incorporating a form of weighting based on association
    strengths between items in the data base.
