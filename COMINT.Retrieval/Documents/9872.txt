information processing in industrial concerns. discusses
    a thesis by j. luef' storage and retrieval of information in
    industrial concerns, presented to the danish technical
    university. the problem of how knowledge which is important for
    selection of material for constructions, for example, can best
    be described in data form is now internationally recognised
    with the creation of the international council of scientific
    unions' committee for scientific and technical data. luef
    distinguishes between retrieval of references and of data; very
    detailed specifications are needed to describe physical objects
    so that they can be referred to in a system. he studies the
    area of anticipative intelligence, i.e. the possibility of
    creating new solutions to a problem and thereby increase
    innovation within the firm. the theoretical discussions are
    soundly based on practical experience and he regards the
    process of retrieval as a tool to be used by the
    decision-maker. the thesis has sections on software and
    hardware, including discussion of the role of man in the search
    process. the 2nd part concerns practical system design in 4
    concerns and description of a demonstration system dart (data
    analysis, retrieval and taxonomy), with cost-benefit
    analysis.
