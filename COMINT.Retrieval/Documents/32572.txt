low noise in solid state parametric amplifiers at
    microwave frequencies the principles of parametric
    amplification are described through the use of simple low
    frequency electrical circuits and their mechanical analogues
    extension of these principles to low noise amplification at
    microwave frequencies is made in a qualitative way which
    emphasizes the physical processes involved amplification is
    only achieved when energy is transferred from a microwave
    oscillator or pump to the signal frequency and it is shown why
    such a transfer may take place in circuits exhibiting variable
    capacitance or inductance but not in circuits where only a
    resistance is varied major noise sources are discussed and the
    special role of the image or idler frequency is noted finally
    experimental data on four different types of parametric
    amplifier using semiconductor diodes and using ferrite are
    given
