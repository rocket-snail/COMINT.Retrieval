the lock in performance of an afc circuit for t the case
    of rc coupling between phase detector and reactance valve in an
    afc system an explicit relation is derived which determines the
    lock in condition in an afc system using a reactance valve
    controlled oscillator the relation involves the filter time
    constant the initial frequency error the phase detector
    constant and the sensitivity of the oscillator
