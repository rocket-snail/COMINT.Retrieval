some indices of solar activity based on ionospheric and
    radio noise measurements methods are described for producing
    indices of solar activity based on the ionization of the e and
    f layers and monthly mean figures thus derived are tabulated
    the two indices are compared with each other and with solar
    noise flux at and the correlation is high practical
    applications of the indices are discussed briefly
