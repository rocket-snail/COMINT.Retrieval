circuit analogues of suhl type masers a tuned circuit in
    which inductance varies with time and two coupled tuned
    circuits in which mutual inductance varies with time are
    analysed and shown to act as amplifiers under certain
    conditions these considerations are preliminary steps to the
    final problem leading to the suhl type maser see also of
