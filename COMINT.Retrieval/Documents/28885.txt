note on the motion of electrons and holes in perturbed
    lattices a new set of orthogonal localized functions is
    discussed the functions bear the same relation to the functions
    of luttinger and kohn as the wannier functions bear to the
    bloch functions the new functions are used to give an
    alternative derivation of the effective mass equation
