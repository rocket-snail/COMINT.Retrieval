a possible explanation of th long duration radar echoes
    of ionized trails in the upper atmosphere in ionospheric
    regions where the plasma frequency is near the frequency of the
    incident wave the local wavelength of the latter is very long
    and the destructive interference of the fields scattered from
    the dispersed trail is less effective
