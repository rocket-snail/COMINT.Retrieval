research into ways in which libraries can best provide
    scientific information. the 1st stage of research has been the
    definition of the role of libraries within the national
    information network. from there, study has continued on the
    relationship between the longterm development of information
    needs and current information work in libraries. information
    needs can be differentiated according to whether they can best
    be satisfied by automated search systems, or by traditional
    methods. a 3rd group can best be satisfied through informal
    channels. all these procedures can be evaluated in the everyday
    work of a library and comparison between practice in the ussr
    and the usa is instructive.
