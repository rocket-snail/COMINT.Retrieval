a microprocessor architecture for bibliographic retrieval
    system. features of a microprocessor based architecture for
    bibliographic retrieval system are illustrated. the proposed
    system consists of the following 3 functional blocks: the
    'query processor', the 'simple query executers' and the 'answer
    composer'. the query processor parses the queries and breaks
    the complex query into simple queries. each simple query
    executer is able to perform the operations satisfying a simple
    query. finally, the answer composer puts together the results
    of all simple query executers and produces the response to the
    query originally raised.
