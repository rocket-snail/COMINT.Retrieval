a variational formulation of the multi stream electro
    dynamic field equations a non relativistic approximation to
    diracs new variational formulation of the single stream
    electrodynamic field equations is presented using vector
    notation and mks units throughout the hamilton jacobi theory of
    a rotational space charge stream is developed the variational
    formulation is generalized to the multi stream case both for a
    finite number and a non denumerably infinite number of
    streams
