discrimation of a synchronized oscillator against
    interfering tones and noise the discrimination exercised by a
    nonlinear regenerative tuned circuit against unwanted signals
    accompanying a synchronizing tone is due partly to the
    frequency response of the system and partly to the nonlinearity
    provided that the synchronizing signal has a greater amplitude
    than the unwanted signals after allowing for frequency response
    the phenomenon is analysed and measurements of discrimination
    against noise are reported the degree of discrimination can be
    very great when the synchronizing frequency is very close to
    the natural frequency of the circuit when the synchronizing
    tone is absent or is not dominant there is no reduction of the
    interference intensity or bandwidth
