the spherical coil as an inductor shield or antenna the
    coil is a single layer winding of constant axial pitch on a
    spherical surface its properties can be expressed by simple
    formulae and can be used to evaluate the shielding effect of a
    closed nonmagnetic metal shell resonance effects are
    studied
