use of microfilm in french provincial archives.
    thirty-five years' experience. following a preliminary detailed
    account of the introduction of microfilm in french provincial
    archives and its gradual integration into normal archive
    management practice, with reference to the elaboration of
    official norms and regulations for use, statistical evidence of
    the expansion of the photographic service is given, showing
    progressive increase in workshop space, specialist personnel
    employed, and microfilm footage production, with reference to
    relevant state publications. the recently implemented programme
    of duplicating important holdings is briefly described, and
    comments made on attitudes in general to use of microfilm,
    positive and negative. concludes that to maintain efficiency,
    the french archive service needs to keep abreast of
    technological development, secure its financial basis, and
    solve the legal problems of reprography.
