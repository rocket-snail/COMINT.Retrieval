the acquisition of and bibliographic access to
    information-a task for libraries?. libraries should be
    responsible for acquiring 2informationsmittel1 as defined by
    georg schmoll supplying a summarised form of information
    sources and presenting it to the user in a practical form. at
    present this type of material (bibliographical material,
    including library catalogues) is not collected by libraries in
    sufficient quantities as it is often not available through
    normal market sources via publishers. as information material
    is generally in a processed form, libraries do not always
    classify the contents further. however, the form in which the
    material is made available to the user is very important as it
    should be possible to make independent use of the information.
    often the material is classified to be used by particular user
    groups, firms, library collectives or sectors of the
    information and documentation system. libraries must take into
    consideration which user groups need which information material
    in their area and also work with other libraries to provide a
    larger selection of national and international information
    material.
