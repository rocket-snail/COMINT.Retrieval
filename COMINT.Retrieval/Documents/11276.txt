information handling in the office of the future.
    information handling in the office of the 1980s will assume new
    conceptual dimensions, as the power, economy and user-empathy
    of a new generation of microprocessor-based equipment open up
    new avenues of systems development and applications potential.
    discusses increasing economy and reliability of computers,
    user-empathy, integrated information handling and
    communication. homogenising the corporate information resource,
    and devising systems to make it universally available and
    acceptable to each potential user at the level required and is
    authorised to work at, calls for a new breed of information
    scientist-cum-diplomat not yet seen on any extant corporate
    scenario.
