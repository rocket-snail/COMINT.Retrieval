the influence of electrical current on the contact
    between metals experiments are reported in whic two blocks of
    gold were pressed together in such a way as to localize contact
    in a single region and current pulses were passed whose
    duration was chosen in relation to the time constants of the
    contact so as to produce the effect of a continuous current the
    constriction resistance between the blocks was measured before
    and after passage of a pulse from these values the changes in
    the contact area were calculated the results indicate that
    below a critical value of current the contact area is unchanged
    but above this current value the contact area is increased by
    passage of current
