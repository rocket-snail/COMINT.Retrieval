    magnetic field when singly ionized an alkaline earth element
    such as be is a strong resonant scatterer of solar radiation
    released in a gaseous state at a distance of earth radii or by
    atom bomb at about above the magnetic pole it could be used to
    mape the geomagnetic field in the vicinity of the earth
