the conception of primary, secondary and tertiary
    information from the point of view of the theory of reflection
    of symbols. using the universal model of transformation of
    information and through structure of data from the point of
    view of the theory of reflection, the similarities and
    differences between primary, secondary and tertiary information
    are outlined. according to whether the symbol is a reflection
    of phenomena or a reflection of a symbol (sign), various orders
    of the reflection are recognised, i.e. the order of the symbol
    reflection. thus primary information is a reflection of a
    phenomenon deposited without a sign/mark, secondary information
    is a reflection of the deposited signs, etc. the statement
    giving the space and time in which a phenomenon is valid is
    called the address.
