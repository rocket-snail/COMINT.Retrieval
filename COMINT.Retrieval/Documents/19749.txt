tatolectromagnetic field equations for a moving medium
    with hall conductivity the well known equation representing the
    electromagnetic field in a moving isotropic conductor is
    adapted to treat the case of an anisotropic conductor such as
    an ionized gas moving in a strong magnetic field by introducing
    a tensor conductivity the modified equation is used to analyse
    astrophysical problems including the propagation of
    magnetohydrodynamic waves
