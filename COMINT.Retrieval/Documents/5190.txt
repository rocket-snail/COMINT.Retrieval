printed circuits some general principles and applications
    of the foil technique methods of producing printed circuits are
    discussed from the viewpoint of the printer the foil technique
    is suitable for both general and special applications the main
    processes involved namely printing etching fusing mechanical
    patterning transfer and multilayer technique are described
    various characteristics of foil conductors are examined and
    some particular applications are indicated
