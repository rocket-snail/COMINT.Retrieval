electron collision frequencies in nitrogen and in the
    lower ionosphere by using an improved version of the electron
    drift velocity tube in the laboratory measurements and an
    improved analysis of rocket data the two sets of results are
    brought into agreement reevaluation of the rocket data involves
    the energy dependence of the electron collision
