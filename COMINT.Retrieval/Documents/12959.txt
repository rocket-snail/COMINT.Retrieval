the structure of the f region of the ionosphere the
    effects of temperature cycles of a decay coefficient which is
    nonuniform with height and of vertical tidal drifts are
    considered the diurnal and seasonal height variations of the f
    region are explained qualitatively by postulating in addition
    to the vertical tides acting on an isothermal chapman region a
    diurnal temperature cycle this requires a decay coefficient
    which does not change rapidly with height on an alternative
    hypothesis involving discontinuities in the height gradient of
    the decay coefficient tidal drifts are still necessary but a
    diurnal temperature cycle is not of major importance
