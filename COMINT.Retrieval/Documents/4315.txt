the ade photo electric integrator the instrument which is
    in the developmental stage is capable of evaluating surface
    integrals of any function over a domain with boundaries not
    containing pooles of the function it comprises essentially a
    bottom lit light diffusing table with a photoplate grating and
    photoelectric cell arranged above the grating represents the
    function and an opaque mask represents the domain of
    integration integrals of a bivariate normal distribution
    function over a domain with irregular boundaries have been
    obtained
