double scattering of electrons with a dipole moment
    quantum mechanical analysis of the case where magnetic and
    electric fields are present between the two targets gives the
    same results as are obtained by treating the electrons as
    classical spinning tops with magnetic moments and classical
    electric dipoles interaction between electron beam and magnet
    the diffraction effect noted when an electron beam grazes a
    sharp edge of a magnet is described and interpreted
