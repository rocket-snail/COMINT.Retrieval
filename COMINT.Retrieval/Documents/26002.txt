doppler shifted radio echoes from aurora note on the
    results of an experiment in which alternate pulsed and cw
    signals at were transmitted northward from a transmitter
    signals recorded at a receiver miles away with aerial beamed
    north showed a doppler frequency shift upward or downward
    correlating respectively with homogeneous and rayed structure
    both shifts may be recorded simultaneously
