excitation processes in the aurora and airglow absolute
    intensities relative ultraviolet intensities and electron
    densities in high latitude aurorae excitation of forbidden
    atomic lines in high latitude aurorae the excitation processes
    are evaluated on the basis of optical and observations
    calculations show that electron densities occur in bright high
    latitude aurorae a summary is given of the various excitation
    and de activation processes which may occur and an attempt is
    made to decide which of these will be of major
    importance
