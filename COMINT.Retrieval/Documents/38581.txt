characteristics of the beam type maser velocity
    distribution of molecules in a beam type maser is analysed by
    an approximate method the average velocity of the molecules is
    much less than the most probable velocity when the power level
    and focusing voltage are low the relations between amplitude
    focuser voltage and frequency agree well with experimental
    results to be detailed in part
