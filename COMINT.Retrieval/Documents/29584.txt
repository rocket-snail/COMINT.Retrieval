the regenerative pulse generator pulses are circulated
    repeatedly in a feedback loop including an expander and a
    filter being alternately shortened in the expander and
    lengthened in the filter and giving an output at each traversal
    a loop gain of unity is maintained by agc for microwave pulses
    the nonlinear expander characteristic may be obtained by means
    of a crystal microwave pulses of duration down to and dc pulses
    down to have been produced possible applications include
    communications radar and measurements were coherent pulse
    trains are required
