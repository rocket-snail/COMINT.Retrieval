the cylindrical te mode cavity including a semiconductor
    sample with tensorial electrical conductivity the impedance
    matrix and characteristic s matrix are derived for two
    configurations of the input guides one case is suitable for the
    measurement of hall mobility and for the other the proper
    conditions for use as an isolator are investigated
