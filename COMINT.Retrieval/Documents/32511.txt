connection and measurement of transform functions on an
    analogue computor the transfer function of linear systems is
    split into products of partial transfer functions which
    facilitates the solution of network problems by analogue
    computer circuits representing the partial functions are given
    and methods of measuring the frequency and time characteristics
    of filter networks are described
