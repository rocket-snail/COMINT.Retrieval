fixed length transmission lines as circuit elements
    resonant systems consisting of fixed length transmission lines
    with a capacitor at each end have decided advantages compared
    with short circuited transmission line sections for use at
    frequencies of the order of analysis is presented which leads
    to simple graphical determination of the line and capacitor
    parameters the analysis is extended to include interstage
    coupling circuits and wide band coupling of an aerial to the
    output stage of a transmitter numerical examples are
    given
