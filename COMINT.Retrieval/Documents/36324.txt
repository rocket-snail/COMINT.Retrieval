an electromechanical stabilizer of the frequency of a
    klystron in the method proposed a portion of the klystron
    output is applied to a cavity resonator the natural frequency
    of which is modulated by a separately excited vibrating
    diaphragm the output of the resonator is detected amplified and
    through a phase detector applied to the klystron reflector the
    theory of the method is discussed and its accuracy is
    determined a comparison with the resonance frequency of the
    absorption line of ammonia has shown that the relative
    frequency error of the method is of the order of
