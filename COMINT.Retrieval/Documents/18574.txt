measurement of a high refractive index for transmission
    of microwaves through a plasma propagation of signals between
    two aerials apart in the afterglow of a argon discharge was
    studied a strong magnetic field was applied propagation of the
    whistler mode was noted and satisfactory agreement with the
    appleton hartree equation was obtained
