library networks. the most efficient type of network has
    global as well as local elements that provide system standards
    as well as local flexibility. such a network structure is now
    possible due to computer technology. the result of this
    development will be the integration of large-scale library
    services with the user-oriented services of local libraries to
    create a national information network.
