unified formulae for filters with tchebycheff type
    insertion loss formulae are derived for the determination of
    zeros and poles of the transfer function based on the
    tchebycheff polynomial or on cauer parameters the
    characteristics and treatment of elliptic functions are
    discussed and curves are given for relating the insertion loss
    requirements to the parameters of the transfer function
