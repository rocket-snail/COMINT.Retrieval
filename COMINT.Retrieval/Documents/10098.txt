trends in modern bibliotherapy. gives an insight into
    author's own work carried out in cooperation with the
    psychiatric department of the district medical centre.
    psychiatric patients are given 1 hour per week of group
    reading, discussions, and writing short essays on selected
    literature in the presence of a librarian, a psychologist and a
    psychiatrist. bibliotherapy aims at breaking the silence
    barrier and helping self-expression. new trends are being
    introduced which take bibliotherapy from clinics into libraries
    for patients released from institutional care. schools of
    librarianship should take an interest, as specialised
    librarians are required for this work.
