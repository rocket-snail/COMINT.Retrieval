the influence of computerised iud-databases on the
    structure of service programmes in academic libraries. since
    the 1970s on-line data bases covering a variety of subjects
    have started to be installed in academic libraries. these
    libraries should be considering how data bases can be used now
    and in the future to improve their service programme structure.
    most data bases cannot be used directly by library users and
    specially trained staff are necessary. it is also important to
    differentiate between the massive range of information services
    now available. the introduction of data bases providing
    immediate access to literature references means that methods of
    increasing the speed of access to the literature itself should
    also be developed.
