the architect's view of multi-purpose plans. using
    libraries and schools for other purposes outside opening hours
    is a natural and good consequence of their developing liaison
    with other cultural activities. the tradition of charging at
    most a nominal rent is less defensible. extra use involves
    upkeep and staffing costs, and organisations may rent
    unsuitable premises for financial reasons. the district centre
    at lyngen, norway, housing a wide range of organisations and a
    potential example of integrated activity, has to charge a rent
    unacceptable to smaller groups. for effective use, all cultural
    premises should have the same financial standing and joint
    administration. in planning or conversion, the needs of
    individual users should be analysed and coordinated. the
    librarian, for instance, should be able to rent certain areas
    full-time (e.g. the necessary space for storing equipment,
    shelving and books) and other areas for the library's actual
    opening hours, outside which they could be used by other
    organisations.
