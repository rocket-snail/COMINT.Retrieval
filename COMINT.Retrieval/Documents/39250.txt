nonlinear filtering and waveshape multiplexing a method
    of providing two channels on one carrier consists of
    differentiating the combined signal clipping to remove one
    component and re integrating to restore the other the removed
    component is recovered by subtracting the retained component
    from the original input experimental circuits and waveforms
    obtained are illustrated the two components being respectively
    a sine wave and a square wave
