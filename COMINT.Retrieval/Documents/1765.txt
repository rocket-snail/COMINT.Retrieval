heavy duty high stability dc power supplies series valve
    stabilizers are considered as a simple step by step development
    of the cathode follower by shunting a resistor or barretter
    across the series valve substantially constant loads of several
    amperes can be stabilized to per cent full circuits are given
    of two typical units providing outputs of and watts with
    efficiencies of and per cent respectively the latter includes a
    device providing audible warning when supply voltage variations
    exceed the range stabilized automatically
