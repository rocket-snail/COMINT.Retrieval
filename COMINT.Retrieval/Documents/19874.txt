library services to patients in scottish hospitals.
    scotland's 15 health boards, 41 local authorities and 2
    voluntary organisations were circularised for information on
    library services to patients in scottish hospitals. of the 41
    local authorities, 5 did not reply, and 7 had no service,
    leaving 70% of authorities providing a service to 62 hospitals.
    this is 17&h% of scotland's 348 hospitals. only 2
    authorities provide a full-time qualified librarian. in many
    instances it is the ward sister who administers the deposit
    collection left by the local library. further details of
    services are given, with particular emphasis on services in the
    cunninghame district, which is in receipt of an urban aid grant
    for the expansion of services to the housebound and to hospital
    patients. appended is 'an ex-patient's view' by j.
