a design for a constant volume amplifier the so called
    constant volume amplifier is used extensively on overseas
    telephone circuits so that a reasonable modulation depth can be
    used without the risk of overmodulation circuit details are
    given of an amplifier which is simple to set up and reliable in
    operation and which uses a cathode follower circuit as a
    variable impedance the results obtained are comparable to those
    given by conventional networks using metal rectifier bridge
    networks
