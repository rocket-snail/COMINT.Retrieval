preliminary report on cosmic ray intensity during
    magnetic storms in july observations at three stations show
    that there was no appreciable change in the primary variation
    spectrum for three successive forbush decreases this may be
    interpreted as an indication of a linear superposition of
    cosmic ray modulation effects during the july disturbances for
    an analysis of cosmic ray intensity recorded at mina aguilar
    during this period as a function of time
