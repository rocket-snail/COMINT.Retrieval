subject cataloguing in large universal libraries. review
    of systems of subject cataloguing (classification) in large
    general libraries, particularly in socialist countries, western
    europe and north america' national, university, large public
    and academy of sciences libraries were taken into account.
    discusses subject headings and use of the main classification
    schemes, including dewey, library of congress and colon.
    classification methods employed in national bibliography
    production are also described. the largest group of libraries
    uses its own systems, then successively ddc, lcc, udc and bbk.
    the situation is unlikely to change much in the future, but the
    number of libraries using their own schemes will diminish,
    while the classed catalogue together with the alphabetical
    subject catalogue will probably become more common.
