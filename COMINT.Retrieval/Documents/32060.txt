government printing reform' an independent managerial
    perspective. contribution to a special issue on us federal
    government printing and publishing reform. there is no
    managerial precept to support the present anomaly of
    congressional operation and control of federal printing and
    publishing matters other than for the priority given to
    production of documents required by congress. the provisions of
    the printing reform legislation promise to perpetuate the
    bureaucratic inefficiences, squabbling, red tape, and
    subterfuges prevalent in the printing and publishing policy
    system. remedies which should be pursued include removing
    congressional intrusion in these matters and establishing
    central responsibility in the executive branch.
