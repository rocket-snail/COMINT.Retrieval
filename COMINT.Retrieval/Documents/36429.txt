the influence of noise on radar meteor observations an
    experimental investigation has been made of the minimum
    detectable echo power from meteor trails using radar equipment
    with incoherent detection for optimum signal noise ratio the
    pulse width must exceed the width of the tube spot
    extraterrestrial noise is predominant receiver noise figure
    being of second order importance variations in the effective
    aerial temperature introduce corresponding variations in the
    observed meter rate using artificial echoes a minimum signal
    noise ratio of is found to be necessary for detection the most
    important parameter is the total received signal energy it is
    not likely that meteors of smaller size can be made observable
    by improving receivers
