a library in brixton. describes a visit to the main
    public library in brixton shortly after the riots in 1981. the
    cultural contrast between life in the street and in the library
    was striking. brixton serves a population of about 90,000, 25%
    of whom are users. the library emphasises outreach services and
    teamwork among the 20 staff employed by the main and 2 branch
    libraries. thus the library serves institutions such as old
    people's homes, hostels for the homeless, youth clubs, prisons.
    help is given to advice centres and 100 people are visited in
    their homes. the children's section contained few books and was
    little used. the riots had not affected the library and good
    relations existed with the young people and their leaders. the
    stock includes books in many foreign languages for the
    immigrant minorities.
