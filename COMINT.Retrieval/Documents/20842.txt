partial drift compensation in electronic dc analog
    computers for differential equations a method particularly
    suitable for computers with time shared elements is described
    the number of compensation points can be much smaller than the
    number of drift sources the method is illustrated by describing
    the compensation of a machine for computing direction
    cosines
