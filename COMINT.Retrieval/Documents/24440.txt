the method of analytical signals study of the
    synchronization of amplitude limited oscillators a method based
    on that of ville of is used to determine the frequency limits
    within which synchronization can be effected for a single tuned
    self limiting valve oscillator the synchronization range is
    given by where is the difference between the frequency of the
    synchronization voltage and the natural frequency of the
    oscillator and e is the amplitude of the oscillation in the
    steady state the phase angle between the two voltages varies
    from o for to a system with wide synchronization range is
    discussed this incorporates a phase discriminator whose output
    proportional to the phase angle between synchronization and
    oscillator voltages is applied to a reactance valve which in
    turn controls oscillator frequency and
