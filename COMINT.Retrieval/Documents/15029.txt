ionospheric heating by hydromagnetic waves the
    dissipation of hydromagnetic waves in the ionosphere causes
    heating this heating is greatest between heights of and km it
    appears that the heating only becomes important during magnetic
    storms it may explain the lifting of the f region and the
    decrease in critical frequency during these periods
    hydromagnetic heating cannot however explain the variations in
    the horizontal component of the earths field during the main
    phase of magnetic storms
