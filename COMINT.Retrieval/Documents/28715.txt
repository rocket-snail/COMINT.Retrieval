explanation of the inaccuracy of secondary electron
    measurements a recording arrangement used for the measurements
    is described a variation of the secondary electron ratio with
    beam density was observed in several metals this variation is
    probably due to the formation of positive ions at the target
    when this is taken into account the secondary electron velocity
    distribution is found to b independent of temperature in the
    range contrary to several other published results
