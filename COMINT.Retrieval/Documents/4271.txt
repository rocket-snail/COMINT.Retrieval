corporate authorship-its role in library cataloguing. an
    exploration of previous attempts to provide a satisfactory
    justification for the treatment of corporate bodies as authors
    reveals a history of partial answers and insufficiently
    detailed analyses both of corporate authorship in particular
    and of authorship in general. the reason for the failures
    probably rests in the fact that authorship is both a complex
    phenomenon and necessarily such a fundamental concept in the
    construction of a library catalogue that it is taken for
    granted. part i deals with the development of the concept of
    corporate authorship and part ii with the nature of authorship
    in general under the headings' authorship by origination,
    authorship by assumption of responsibility, corporate
    utterances and corporate authorship. in conclusion relates
    corporate authorship to library cataloguing.
