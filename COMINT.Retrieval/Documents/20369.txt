thermally compensated crystal oscillator frequency
    stabilization without the use of a temperature controlled oven
    is obtained by varying the effective shunt load of the crystal
    a thermistor bead being the temperature sensitive element
    transistor circuit varies reactance frequency control of a
    oscillator to within is achieved by means of a variable
    reactance circuit which produces an effective capacitance
    change of up to for a change in emitter current from zero
    to
