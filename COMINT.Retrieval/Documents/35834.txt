need for a multipurpose cadastre. the increasing demand
    for land information at all levels of government and in the
    private sector, and the increasing involvement of federal
    agencies and programmes in the development and maintenance of
    land-information systems induced the federal agencies to
    support this study. the report considers the basic components
    (reference frame, base map, and cadastral overlay) of a
    multipurpose cadastre, which, if properly established and
    maintained, would provide the common framework for all land
    information systems.
