visual literacy' a vital skill. the ability to draw
    appropriate meaning from a visual representation (of whatever
    kind) is an important information skill. students should be
    able to interrogate maps, diagrams, paintings, photographs and
    other visual images, including moving pictures, recognising
    specific conventions in use and their limitations. critical
    examination of content and context, the implications of
    supporting textual or aural accompaniment, and an understanding
    of the possibilities of manipulation and bias, need to be
    carefully nurtured. the value of pictorial sources for primary
    research data is emphasised.
