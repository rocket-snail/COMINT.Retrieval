the travelling workshops experiment: an attempt at
    'illuminative evaluation'. contribution to an issue on the
    application of qualitative approaches to the study of
    information problems. an account of the background against
    which a non-traditional strategy of evaluation was adopted in
    newcastle-upon-tyne polytechnic's travelling workshops
    experiment (see 77/3731). the clear-cut distinctions originally
    envisaged for the internal and external components of the
    evaluation became blurred and there was conflict between
    pressures for a traditional, tightly-controlled evaluation and
    the researchers' preference for a more explanatory evaluation
    strategy. illuminative evaluation was used; this eschews pre-
    and post-testing in favour of a wide-ranging study of the
    contextual determinants of a venture's success. its use poses
    many problems because it is a broad strategy rather than a set
    of specific techniques.
