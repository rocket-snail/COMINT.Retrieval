the cultural and artistic heritage in libraries. lecture
    given at a meeting of the library association of east germany,
    jan 81. in order to rectify unsuitable differences in the
    provision of the german literary heritage in libraries of
    various sizes, a list has been published of recommended stocks,
    according to library size, from the main works of 43 german
    writers and poets from 1750 to 1848. all public libraries
    should check their stocks and transfer material to places where
    it is most needed. to arouse public interest in this period,
    lectures, readings and exhibitions will be organised and
    critical bibliographies and collected works published. it may
    be possible to attract readers through a growing interest in
    modern writers.
