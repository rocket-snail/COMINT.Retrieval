a long lived packaged amplifier for aircraft the
    development and construction of units with a probable life of
    hours are described selected valves are pressed into cast al
    wells lined with a silicone rubber paste which is hardened by a
    short curing process this is more effective for heat transfer
    than al dust or foil deposited carbon resistors and capacitors
    serviceable at are mounted on a phenolic board supported by the
    al base and wired to a recessed plug the assembled unit after
    testing is embedded in liquid plastic which is then solidified
    test figures for heat dissipation under different conditions
    are given
