the agent and the learner' interactions in assisted adult
    library learning. relationships between adult independent
    learners and assisting librarians were examined using the
    critical incident technique, a means for eliciting narrative
    data. 39 learner's advisors provided descriptions of important
    effective and ineffective encounters with adults who sought new
    skills or knowledge through systematic library assistance. the
    agent and the learner create complex encounters in which the
    information given is less important to learning than the
    quality of the giving.
