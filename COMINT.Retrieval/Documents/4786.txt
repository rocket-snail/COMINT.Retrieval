adjustable electronic delay circuit for the microsecond
    range a modification of a pulse discriminator circuit of a type
    described by moody et al using secondary emission pentodes is
    described by means of an adjustable capacitance coupling dynode
    and grid the time interval between successive negative and
    positive pulses derived in the circuit can be adjusted between
    and for an application of the method in a delayed coincidence
