the distribution of temperature along a thin rod
    electrically heated in vacuo the theoretical solution presented
    in part is considered in the light of formulae discussed by
    stead relating the temperature distribution in a finite rod to
    that in an infinitely long rod heated by the same current a
    useful expression is found for the temperature at the centre of
    a finite long rod as a function of its length detailed
    experimental verification of the main theoretical results is

    follow from the theory developed the physics of experimental
