investigation of the inelastic reflection of electrons by
    a cuprous oxide surface the energy losses of electrons on
    reflection at monocrystalline or polycrystalline surfaces are
    equal to the energy required to transfer electrons of the
    crystal lattice from filled to permitted zones the mechanism
    involved is similar to that responsible for the appearance of
    discrete groups of true secondary electrons
