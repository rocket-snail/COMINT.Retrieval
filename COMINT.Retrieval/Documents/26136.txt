determination of voltage current and magnetic field
    distributions together with the self capacitance inductance and
    hf resistance of single layer coils a theoretical investigation
    is made which is applicable to coils of intermediate lengths
    the number and magnitudes of the harmonics are calculated and
    their effect on the self capacitance is indicated experimental
    results obtained by other workers support the theoretical
    results
