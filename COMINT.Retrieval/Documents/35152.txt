on the dielectric constant of the water in wet clay an
    explanation is put forward of the variation with moisture
    content of the permittivity of soil samples previously observed
    by cownie and palmer of it is suggested that relatively dry
    clay consists of closely packed water coated particles in an
    air matrix while relatively wet clay consists of particles
    uniformly distributed in a water increasing from the value for
    bound water about to that for free water about as the
    percentage of water is increased
