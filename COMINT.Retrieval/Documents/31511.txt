the effective recombination coefficients in the and
    layers during the solar eclipse of the contribution to the
    ionization of each of two isolated sources of radiation assumed
    to exist near the east and west limbs of the sun is derived and
    expressed as a linear function of where is the effective
    recombination coefficient during the eclipse on equating the
    corresponding functions for khartoum and ibadan it is found
    that for both places as against the value obtained for khartoum
    on assuming that the intensity of ionizing radiation fell to
    zero at second contact for the layer it is concluded
    that
