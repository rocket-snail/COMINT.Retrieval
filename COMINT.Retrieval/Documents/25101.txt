visual communication technology' priorities for the
    1980s. since the late 1970s, the japanese nippon telegraph and
    telephone public corporation has been conducting research to
    determine which visual communications services and study
    programmes will be required in the 1980s. market research was
    carried out to ascertain the major visual communications
    requirements in leading business organisations. the systems
    found to have the greatest potential for development were
    videoconferencing, interactive information retrieval,
    facsimile, document processing, and office automation (the
    latter integrating all 4 systems). in the light of these
    results, suggests a study programme for the 80s and indicates
    which technologies should be developed.
