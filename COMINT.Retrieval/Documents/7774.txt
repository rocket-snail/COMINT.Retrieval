theoretical and experimental investigation of distortion
    in low frequency junction transistor quadripoles expressions
    are derived for calculating distortion by differentiating the
    quasilinear hybrid parameters of the quadripole methods are
    described of measuring distortion in junction transistor
    quadripoles in earthed base earthed emitter and earthed
    collector circuits calculated and measured results are compared
    for the earthed emitter circuits close agreement is found the
    application of the results of the investigation to the design
    of transistor amplifiers is discussed see also of
