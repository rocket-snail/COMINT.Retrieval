the determination of the electron density distribution of
    an ionosphere layer in the presence of an external magnetic
    field the electron density distribution is determined by
    finding the actual heights at which waves of various
    frequencies are reflected these true heights are obtained from
    experimental curves by obtaining the exact solution as a
    convergent series of integrals of the integral equation giving
    the group height as a function of frequency the errors arising
    in the numerical work are shown by applying the procedure to hf
    curves obtained theoretically from layers of known shape and
    such errors are seen to be small compared with those made
    through use of other procedures
