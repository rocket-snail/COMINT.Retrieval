viewdata systems' designing a database for effective user
    access. viewdata systems, still in their infancy, have the
    potential for revolutionising access to information.
    realisation of this potential requires a user-oriented system,
    based on sound principles of information retrieval, with
    maximum use of available technology. examines user requirements
    in accessing viewdata systems, discusses the problems and
    principles involved in providing effective access to present
    systems, and considers future directions in their development
    and improvement.
