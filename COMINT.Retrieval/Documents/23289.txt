practical calculation of jacobis sn elliptic function
    with special reference to the determination of the cauer
    parameter for filters with operative attenuation
    characteristics elliptic functions encountered in calculations
    of tchebycheff type filters are considered the method of
    deriving these functions and hence the attenuation frequency
    curve is shown in detail for the case of an antimetrical low
    pass filter formulae for calculating the functions are
    tabulated in an appendix
