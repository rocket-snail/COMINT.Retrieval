unimarc. several agencies that were formerly satisfied by
    single conversions from another format are beginning to require
    data from multiple agencies. either multiple conversions must
    be written or a switch to unimarc could take place. the cost
    savings with unimarc are obvious. multiple conversions
    programmes represent a high initial investment and a tremendous
    problem in keeping up with all of the changes to necessarily
    dynamic national formats. the introduction of aacr2 and
    resultant national format changes are at this time causing
    several agencies to rewrite conversion programmes. a major
    obstacle to a truly international unimarc exchange is that the
    change takes a joint commitment since an agency's ability to
    receive unimarc records is useless if the sending agency cannot
    send them. ifla and its members need to undertake a major
    effort to bring a unimarc programme into service.
