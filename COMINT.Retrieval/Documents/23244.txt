quality issues in retrospective conversion projects. late
    in dec 79 a questionnaire was sent to 446 members of oclc,
    inc., to ascertain their views on the development of a special
    minimal standard to be used only for retrospective conversion
    projects. it was found that 74.5% would oppose the creation of
    a new lower standard. despite the possibility of extra
    requirements to upgrade an earlier catalogue record to meet
    current standards, librarians, in general, showed a strong
    commitment toward quality and compliance with current
    standards.
