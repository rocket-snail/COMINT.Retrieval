diffraction of electromagnetic waves by an aperture in a
    large screen the approximate solution of the three dimensional
    diffraction problem is obtained by using a single component of
    the hertz vector the results are applied to the calculation of
    the field in the plane of a circular aperture which is large
    compared with the wavelength experiments confirm some of the
    theoretical results
