amplification using a precessing magnetic moment an
    account is given of the analysis of an arrangement in which two
    tuned circuits are coupled to a precessing magnetic moment it
    is shown that with where and are the resonance frequencies of
    the circuits and the precession frequency useful amplification
    can be obtained in the course of the analysis the bloch
    equations are solved to a higher order in approximation than is
    usual parametric amplification of the fast electron wave
