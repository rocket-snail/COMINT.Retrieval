a stabilised extra high tension rectifier for description
    of equipment using a triode control valve which functions as a
    variable resistor in the dc circuit the reference voltage is
    provided by a dry battery the output voltage fluctuations are
    only of those of the mains supply the output voltage
    fluctuations are only of those of the mains supply the output
    voltage is variable between and in four overlapping stages each
    subdivided into steps which can be varied continuously
    protective measures are described
