wiser from experience: a study of practical work as an
    element of library education. library school courses have for a
    long time included periods of practical work to enable students
    to apply their theoretical training to practical situations in
    libraries. such periods may take the form of 'self-orientation'
    periods, providing the student with all-round experience of
    library techniques or 'experience' periods, during which the
    student may carry out detailed study of a particular topic. in
    the netherlands most library school courses are too short to
    allow students to gain more than a brief view of library
    routines in practice. in addition, students often fail to
    derive the maximum benefit from their practical training
    because of inadequate preparation by the library schools and
    the heavy workload of course tutors. there should be regular
    consultation between student, course-tutor and training library
    to ensure that all aspects of practical training are being
    covered.
