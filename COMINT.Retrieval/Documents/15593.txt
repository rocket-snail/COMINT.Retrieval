experiments on radiation by fast electron be ms the
    design of a magnet system for an undulator in which the field
    direction alternates periodically along th electron path of is
    described a electron beam from a linear accelerator was p ssed
    through the system light radiated by the beam was determined
    using a small linear accelerator with good bunching action and
    beam energy r diation at wavelengths below was observed peak
    power output was millimetre waves were also generated in the
    accelerator tube
