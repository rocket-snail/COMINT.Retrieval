the electrical conductivity and current noise of carbon
    resistors the variation of resistance with temperature pressure
    and magnetic field in several types of carbon resistor was
    measured down to liquid he temperatures the dependence of the
    noise spectrum on the current intensity temperature and
    magnetic field was also investigated the law holds at all
    temperatures
