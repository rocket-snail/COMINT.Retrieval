the utilization of degenerate modes in a spherical cavity
    formulae are derived for calculating the coupling coefficients
    between an arbitrary number of modes excited simultaneously in
    a cavity resonator the perfect symmetry of the sphere gives
    rise to a high degree of degeneracy ie many independent field
    configurations with the same natural frequency experiments on a
    spherical cavity gave results in good agreement with the theory
    practical coupling devices discussed include irises loops and
    small volumes of conductor placed within the cavity
