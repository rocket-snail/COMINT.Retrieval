theory of the radio echo meteor height distribution in a
    non isothermal atmosphere the height distribution of echoing
    points of shower and sporadic meteors belonging to a
    homogeneous velocity group is calculated for a model atmosphere
    whose scale height is a linear function of height experimental
    cut off and the theoretical approximations involved limit the
    accuracy with which actual scale height and density may be
    found from observed meteor trails
