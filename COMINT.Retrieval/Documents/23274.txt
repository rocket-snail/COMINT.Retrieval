effect of valve noise on oscillators the magnitudes of
    the valve shot effect and circuit thermal noise in oscillators
    are compared when the oscillatory circuit is connected to the
    grid the valve noise is relatively negligible when the
    oscillatory circuit is connected to the anode the valve noise
    preponderates
