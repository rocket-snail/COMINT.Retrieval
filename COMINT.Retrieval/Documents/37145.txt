in the poet's land. the muzei-zapovednik a.s. pushkina
    (a.s. pushkin museum-preserve) is a literary mecca in june on
    pushkin's name-day. poems are read and songs performed in his
    honour. librarians should help readers to appreciate pushkin's
    poetry. the regional library could compile a work on pushkin
    based on the museum's visitors' books, dating from 1899.
    readers could be encouraged to describe how they discovered
    pushkin. pushkin literary evenings should treat only one of his
    works and adapt to the audience's age group. for these,
    librarians could study variants of his poems, the social life
    and popular culture of his time. the pushkinogorets regional
    library should become a repository of pushkin area legends. the
    museum strives to encourage a lively perception of
    history.
