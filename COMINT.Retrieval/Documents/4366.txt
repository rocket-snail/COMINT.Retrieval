diffraction by two parallel planes of finite length the
    diffracting system comprises a pair of parallel perfectly
    conducting planes of infinite width and finite length an
    incident em wave polarized perpendicular to the edges of the
    planes is considered the theory thus applies equally to the
    diffraction of a plane sound wave two integral equations are
    derived approximate solutions are obtained for the condition an
    equation is derived giving the value of for resonance of the
    system this is solved approximately and a formula is given for
    the end correction ie the difference between the resonant
    length and
