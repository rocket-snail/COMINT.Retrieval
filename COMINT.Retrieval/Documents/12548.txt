some general properties of nonlinear elements part small
    signal theory the analysis of nonlinear capacitor modulators
    demodulators and negative conductance amplifiers with only two
    signal frequencies present gives results that agree with the
    general energy relations of part of in addition the gain
    bandwidth terminal admittances and sensitivity to changes in
    terminal admittances or in local oscillator drive are given
    together with their dependence upon the amount of nonlinearity
    generally the bandwidth of these devices approaches zero as the
    nonlinearity approaches zero
