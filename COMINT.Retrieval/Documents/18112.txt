motion of clouds of abnormal ionization in the auroral
    and polar regions a study has been made of unusual types of
    echo exhibited by film records of rapid succession sweep
    observations at several stations in northern canada three
    distinct types of echo are identified probably corresponding to
    horizontally moving e clouds clouds descending vertically from
    the f to the e layer and clouds moving at extremely high
    velocities in the e layer type echoes were observed only at
    stations very close t the auroral zone maximum and may be due
    to sweeping of the auroral ionizing agent type echoes also
    appear to be related to an auroral ionizing agent
