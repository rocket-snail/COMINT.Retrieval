relations between the lenin state library and the royal
    library. paper presented at the 1st swedish-soviet seminar on
    'the national library within a country's library and
    information services' development prospects' held in moscow,
    21-22 nov 78. outlines the development of the swedish-russian
    library cooperation during the past 20 years. an important step
    in this respect was the bilateral exchange agreement in 1964
    which became the mainstay of the royal library's russian
    collection. although the gosudarstvennaya publichnaya
    biblioteka sssr im. v.i. lenina (lenin state library) is the
    largest partner, cooperation is also established with other
    libraries in the ussr. over the years many personal contacts
    have been developed between russian and swedish librarians and
    extension activities, based on materials from the ussr
    organised.
