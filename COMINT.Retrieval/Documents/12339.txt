model for the surface potential barrier and the periodic
    deviations in the schottky effect the model is based on the
    quantum mechanical calculation by bardeen on the form of the
    potential at the surface of a sodium like metal and the
    analysis of sachs and dexter on the quantum limits of the image
    face theory the periodic deviations are recalculated and
    results compared with previous theory and experiment
