a transistor digital fast multiplier with
    magnetostrictive storage the multiplier is operated at a basic
    frequency of and comprises timing waveform generator arithmetic
    unit and storage system except for the use of junction
    transistors in the amplifiers associated with the storage
    system point contact types are used throughout out of a total
    of point contact transistors junction transistors and crystal
    diodes three point contact units have failed in seven months of
    daily operation no selection of transistors is required the
    total power consumption is
