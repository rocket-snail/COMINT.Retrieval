the public library in the technological eighties. the
    history of computerisation in the east london public library
    (south africa) is outlined. an evaluation of the current status
    shows that the system is dated in relation to new technology. a
    change to an on-line system is foreseen. since aacr2 and samarc
    were not in existence at the time of initial computerisation,
    the present system is incompatible with them-a factor that will
    affect cooperation with other libraries in a possible future
    network. the possible use in public libraries of computers and
    other technological advances, such as reading aids for the
    blind, is discussed and public librarians are urged to be
    forward-looking and enterprising in adopting
    innovations.
