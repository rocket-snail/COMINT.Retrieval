theory of diffraction of electromagnetic waves at a
    perfectly conducting disk and related problems the problem
    considered in of for plane em waves is solved generally for the
    case of spherical waves particular solutions are also obtained
    for the diffraction at an ellipsoid of revolution for a
    solenoidal em field a method for the numerical solution is
    outlined for the case of diffraction at a disk at a circular
    aperture and at an ellipsoid of revolution valid for
    approximately where as is the radius or half the distance
    between the foci as appropriate
