user reactions to precis in the british education index.
    reactions of users to precis (preserved context index system)
    subject indexing in british education index were studied by
    structured interviews as part of a wider survey of precis user
    reaction in the uk. findings are presented in terms of ease of
    use, effective retrieval of citations, whether too much
    information is provided in entries, the structure of index
    entries and the relationship between terms, and the possibility
    of a '1-stage' index. conclusions are that in a specialised
    field like education a sophisticated indexing technique cannot
    obviate the indexer's specialised subject knowledge, but that
    the basic principles of precis are not under attack, and
    entries should not be further simplified. a majority considered
    precis better than the publication's previous indexing
    method.
