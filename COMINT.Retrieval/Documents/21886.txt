the longer the number, the smaller the spine' or, up and
    down with melvil and elsie. discusses the paradox of
    traditional library classification' the aim of expressing on
    subject in detail is in conflict with the aim of providing an
    inexpensive and useful device by which books can be shelved and
    retrieved. suggests the use of 2 different schemes (or 2 levels
    of the same scheme). the 1st scheme would provide
    classification numbers of reasonable lengths to arrange items
    in broad subject groups whilst the 2nd scheme (or variant of
    the 1st) would provide longer numbers for detailed subject
    access and comprehensive browsing capability in on-line
    systems. these schemes could be applied to all types of library
    materials.
