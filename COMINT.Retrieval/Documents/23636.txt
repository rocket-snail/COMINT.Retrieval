a proposed modification to the csiro mark computer the
    suggestion is put forward that a facility be built into the
    machine for distinguishing between machine commands and
    interpretive or hyper commands so that the former are performed
    directly while on receipt of one of the latter control is
    directed to the head of the interpretation routine with
    simultaneous storage of the link datum to enable return of
    control to the nedt programme command after performance of the
    hyperfunction this would result in a considerable gain in speed
