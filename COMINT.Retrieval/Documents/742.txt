amplifier noise particularly in the audio frequency range
    noise in input stages is investigated nyquists formula is taken
    as starting point and only simple mathematics is used noise in
    resistors is dealt with by the usual device of substituting an
    equivalent noise voltage source in series with a noise free
    resistor the input circuit of a capacitor microphone is
    considered particularly its noise voltage is determined largely
    by the slope and position of the low frequency flank of the
    response curve noise in oscillating circuits is associated with
    the damping resistance formulae are given for calculating the
    equivalent noise resistance of valves for the same operating
    point a valve produces much more noise in the af range than at
    higher frequencies the signal noise ratio of a circuit with
    ideal input transformer is considered and the condition for
    obtaining maximum sensitivity is derived
