theory of forced oscillations in electrodynamic systems
    the method of analysis using vector series progressing
    according to the eigenfunctions of the wave equation is applied
    to a system comprising cylindrical resonator and coaxial line
    the theoretical assumption underlying the method are examined
    and the green tensor appropriate to linear electrodynamic
    processes is formulated
