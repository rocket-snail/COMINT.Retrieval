law of legal deposit relating to 'library materials' in
    the light of the new media act. the austrian law of legal
    deposit was due for reform, partly to bring up to date the
    price limits for books deposited, and partly to extend the
    scope to include multi-media categories. the new act, which
    came into force in june 81, is criticised for its exclusion of
    non-book materials (especially films) in spite of the fact that
    the austrian national library has a legal obligation, since
    july 81, to maintain multi-media archives. there is also
    criticism of the inclusion of parliament as a deposit library,
    of the extended categories of exemption and of the decision to
    allow publishers 1 month in which to deposit instead of 8 days
    as previously.
