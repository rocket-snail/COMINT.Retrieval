series capacitors multiply battery voltage the voltage
    obtainable by charging capacitors in parallel and discharging
    them in series is increased by using a set of capacitors of
    graded capacitance values and charging the first by the battery
    only th second by the battery in series with the first
    capacitor and so on the method has been used to provide using
    six capacitors with a battery
