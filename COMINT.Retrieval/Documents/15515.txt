on the filter problem of the power spectrum analyzer in
    an analyser for determining the power spectrum of random noise
    a signal derived by repeating a finite sample of the noise
    record is d heterodyned with another signal whose frequency is
    swept over the whole spectrum and the resultant is passed
    through a narrow filter and then detected an investigation is
    made of the optimum filter response for minimizing the
    intrinsic error associated with the finite size of the sample
    the lowest probable error for various types of filter is
    tabulated the rate of the frequency sweep must be small
    compared to the half bandwidth squared for the filter response
    to remain substantially the same as its steady state
    response
