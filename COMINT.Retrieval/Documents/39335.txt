the results of a cataloguing in publication experiment.
    on 1 sept 80, the royal library of the netherlands and the isbn
    bureau of the dutch central bookhouse began a 6-month study of
    cataloguing-in-publication. a cip office was created in the
    royal library, to which 19 publishers agreed to submit details
    of new books in preparation. from information supplied
    catalogue entries were prepared and forwarded to the publishers
    for inclusion in the appropriate books. at the end of the study
    a questionnaire was circulated to the publishers who had
    participated in the scheme, together with 21 academic libraries
    and 26 booksellers in the netherlands. almost all concerned
    felt that the experiment had been a success. however, the
    experience of cip bureau staff showed that it was essential to
    maintain close contact between publishers and the
    bureau.
