evangelical parish public libraries past and present.
    protestant parish libraries in germany began in the 19th
    century, partly through missionary impulses and partly through
    the development of the school system. their work was
    interrupted in the 1930s and began again in 1945, when walter
    schwarz and eva lindber refounded the deutsche verband
    evangelischer buchereien (german association of evangelical
    libraries), which has overall control of the parish libraries,
    providing advice, organising conferences and compiling
    statistics. a library school was founded which had to close in
    the 1970s through lack of funds. the parish libraries are
    staffed mainly by volunteers, for whom short training courses
    are provided, with professional staff in top posts. a quarterly
    periodical is published containing library news and 1,800
    reviews annually of new publications, for one of which an
    annual book prize is awarded.
