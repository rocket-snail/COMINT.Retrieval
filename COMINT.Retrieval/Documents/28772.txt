liberalisation of the use of british telecommunications
    network. report to the uk secretary of state for industry,
    exploring the economic implications of leasing the british
    telecommunications (bt) network to others who 'would have
    unrestricted use of the capacity to provide services'. finds
    that consumer benefits are likely to outweigh the projected
    loss of net revenue by bt; bt should continue to decide prices
    at which circuits are to be leased; and bt should be free to
    engage in competition for the non-voice markets, subject to
    regulatory safeguards and pro-competitive mechanisms.
