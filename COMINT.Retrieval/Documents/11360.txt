an new index of solar activity based on ionospheric
    measurements the monthly mean relative sunspot number is
    assumed to contain a component constituting a direct index of
    solar activity together with an error component having a
    standard deviation of about a new index based on an analysis of
    the critical frequency of the layer over the period has been
    constructed whose residual error component is only one tenth
    that the magnitude of for a given month is computed from the
    mean noon layer critical frequencies at slough huancayo and
    watheroo and is based in effect on a calibration of the layer
    critical frequencies in terms of
