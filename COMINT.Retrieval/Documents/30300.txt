some comments on the future of public librarianship.
    since world war ii there has been an unprecedented growth in
    the netherlands in the provision of public services, including
    medical care, social welfare and education. this growth has not
    been achieved in an orderly manner but has come about by the
    sudden expansion of separate sectors. in the last 10 years
    control of the public services has become a subject for much
    discussion in the dutch parliament with the result that the
    government has made provision for members of the public to have
    a greater say in the running of these services. in future
    factors which will seriously affect public library services
    include the slowdown in economic growth, increased unemployment
    and the reduced birth-rate. to meet these challenges a reform
    of local government services is necessary.
