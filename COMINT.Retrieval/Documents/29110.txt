computers in public libraries. a norwegian county
    librarians' conference (sept 80) defined 2 main purposes of
    automation' (1) library technology and administrative routines;
    (2) indexing, storage and retrieval of information. norwegian
    public libraries should probably begin with administrative
    routines and proceed gradually, while discussing major
    long-term objectives, such as' an integrated system; a
    decentralised system utilising central services; libraries not
    using computers themselves, but largely dependent on
    computerised productions. the library centre will eventually
    act as a data base for public library literature and a centre
    for public library computer operations. local systems are
    viable only for the largest libraries; small and medium-sized
    libraries must be linked to a central authority, and hence to
    the resources of the large libraries. public libraries must
    formulate their own policy for automation, evaluating systems
    accordingly.
