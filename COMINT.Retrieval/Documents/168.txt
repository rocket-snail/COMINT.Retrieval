feedback amplifier design discussion of the pole pattern
    required for a low pass amplifier with overall feedback
    analysis is presented for an amplifier whose gain function
    contains no internal zeros and for which the feedback fraction
    is independent of frequency a general solution applicable to
    any number of poles is obtained for the case of critical
    damping for amplifiers with maximally flat response curves of
    graphical solutions are given for systems with n poles where n
    ranges from to the synthesis of a prescribed pole pattern is
    considered and the method of realizing conjugate poles by
    feedback pairs id described
