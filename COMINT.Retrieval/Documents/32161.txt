sorption properties of thin nickel films the sorption of
    o and h by ni films is studied oxygen the diffraction of
    electromagnetic waves at a conducting circular disk and at a
    circular aperture in a conducting plane screen numerical
    results of calculations based on the rigorous theory of
    diffraction of meixner and andrejewski of are given these
    describe the characteristics of diffracted waves in the near
    and far fields and are valid when the circumference of the disk
    and the wavelength are of comparable magnitude the methods of
    approximation commonly used are critically examined
