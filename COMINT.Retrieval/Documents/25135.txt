rigorous solution of a particular diffraction phenomenon
    diffraction of a plane wave by a perfectly conducting
    infinitely thin screen is analysed using an infinite system of
    algebraic equations and an infinite number of unknowns for th
    case of the electric vector parallel to the screen edges the
    procedure is to calculate the vector potential for the surface
    assuming a sinusoidal distribution of parallel straight line
    currents extension of the method to the more general case of
    arbitrary direction of electric vector would be feasible using
    electronic computers
