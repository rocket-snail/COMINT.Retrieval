rak (rules for alphabetical cataloguing) discussed. the
    authorised edition of rak was published in berlin in 1976 and
    in wiesbaden in 1977. this completed alphabetical cataloguing
    reform in germany. from 1976-79 much literature dealing with
    rak was published. many of the publications were concerned with
    adaptations of rak to specific types of libraries such as
    rak-wb (wissenschaftliche bibliotheken) academic libraries or
    rak-ob (offentliche bibliotheken) public libraries. this was
    also the case in east germany where adaptations of rak for
    public libraries, research libraries and union libraries were
    published. literature is available explaining in detail the use
    of rak in certain subject areas such as law, biblical
    literature, archive literature, journals, newspapers and
    congress reports. reports and discussions on experiences of
    libraries in the introduction of rak and the best methods of
    training staff mostly stem from east germany and are only first
    initiatives in this field.
