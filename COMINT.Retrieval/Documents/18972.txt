the mean free path of conduction electrons in bismuth
    experimental results for bi single crystals are given from
    which it is concluded that in agreement with the suggestion of
    sondheimer of the mean free path of the conduction electrons in
    bi is much longer than in normal metals and that for electrons
    travelling perpendicular to the triad axis the path length is
    probably in the range at room temperature
