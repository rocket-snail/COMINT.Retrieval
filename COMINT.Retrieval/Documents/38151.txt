the effect of noise on the frequency stability of a
    linear oscillator the standard conditions for a sinusoidal
    oscillation are that the attenuation and net phase shift around
    the closed loop be zero random fluctuations are relied upon to
    start the oscillation if the level of oscillation is to remain
    finite in the continued presence of noise the oscillating loop
    must hav some attenuation and functions like a highly
    regenerative amplifier with a loop gain very nearly unity
    accordingly the oscillator produces not a single frequency but
    rather a narrow band of noise that causes instability in the
    magnitude and in the apparent frequency of the output thes
    instabilities are discussed for oscillators in which all
    elements are linear except for some slow acting amplitude
    control the bandwidth of the noisy oscillation can be predicted
    from easily measured system characteristics several methods of
    defining the frequency of the output are considered with
    special reference to precision measurements in general the
    measured frequency departs from the zero phase shift criterion
    and is dependent on the measuring equipment methods of
    minimizing instabilities due to noise are investigated
