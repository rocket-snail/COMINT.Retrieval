variations of d layer attenuation at results of daytime
    reflection coefficient measurements made over a period of
    several years are analysed the noon value of the attenuation is
    neper in winter nearly neper in summer though the scatter of
    values is considerably greater in winter than in summer the
    excessive absorption observed in winter on short waves is not
    observed at this frequency the influence of the d layer on the
    propagation of atmospherics is discussed and the attenuation
    variations are compared with those of geomagnetic
    activity
