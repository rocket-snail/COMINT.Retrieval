the statistical mechanics dynamics and
    magnetohydrodynamic of plasmas a system of equations is
    established in particular to denote the movement the current
    and the compression tensor of an ionized gas these are applied
    to partially and completely ionized gases and used to obtain
    the general equations of magneto hydrodynamics propagation
    modes of different types of wave are determined
