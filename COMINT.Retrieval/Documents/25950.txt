diffraction of cm electromagnetic waves by cylindrical
    objects a brass tube and a hard rubber rrod both of diameter
    and length were used as obstacles in the path of a plane pulsed
    wave with the electric vector parallel to the cylinder axis
    observations were made of the diffraction patterns in planes
    perpendicular to the direction of incidence experimental
    results for the brass cylinder are in good agreement with
    calculations based on scalar diffraction theory the patterns
    for the rubber rod exhibit a pronounced peak immediately behind
    the rod and differ in other ways from the patterns for the
    brass tube particularly in the vicinity of the shadow the
    results are compared with those obtained by kodis of
