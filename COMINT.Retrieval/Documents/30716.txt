the design of a radio frequency coaxial resistor
    characteristics of the cylindrical coaxial resistor intended
    for use as a reflection free termination are discussed and
    design curves given the jacket diameter is chosen to maintain
    the resistive component of the resistor at the required value
    the reactive component may be compensated in two ways the first
    suitable for resistor lengths consists in undercutting the line
    the second requires the insertion of a short circuited
    transmission line in series with the resistor and will give
    either perfect compensation over a restricted frequency range
    or less accurate compensation over a wide range the effect of
    the holder is taken into account
