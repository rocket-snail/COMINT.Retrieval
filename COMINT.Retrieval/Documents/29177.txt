american library scene (impressions of american libraries
    and librarians). a ussr librarian, for 8 years (1970-78) the
    director of the un library in new york, describes impressions
    made on her by us libraries and us library life. dependence of
    both public and research libraries on private capital is the
    reason for their uneven development throughout the country.
    modern library equipment in both small and large libraries,
    automation, development of integrated library systems and
    library cooperation are seen as the main achievements. library
    administration, management, personnel (with special reference
    to the status of women), education, employment situation, the
    role of library associations in us librarianship, and library
    conferences and their organisation are discussed.
