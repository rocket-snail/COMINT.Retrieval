transistors and saturable core transformers as square
    wave oscillators the use of transistors as switches for the dc
    supply to saturable core transformers is described and it is
    shown that by this means small and efficient convertors and
    invertors can be constructed the common base common emitter and
    common collector configurations are considered and methods of
    obtaining a multiphase output are described
