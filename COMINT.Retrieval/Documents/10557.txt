abnormal ionospheric absorption observed during february
    observations from stations all over the world are analysed very
    high absorption was observed during the period february within
    a limited region the eastern and western limits of the affected
    region are not known accurately because of the sparseness of
    stations no effect was observed in america or in the far east
    the southern limit was observed in africa roughly along the
    line joining casablanca and djibouti an explanation involving
    corpuscular radiation fits the observations better than one
    based directly on wave radiation from the sun the absorption is
    thought to occur in low altitude ionized layers such as that
    detected by gnanalingam and weekes of
