    r & d. note. an english translation of this article is
    published in scientific and technical information processing,
    (1) 1980, 63-65. suggests that information centres are in the

    expenditure connected with new projects. such evaluations must
    be based on an analysis of literature data, inventions and
    technical reports; the range of the documentation covered by
    the analysis should be as wide as possible.
