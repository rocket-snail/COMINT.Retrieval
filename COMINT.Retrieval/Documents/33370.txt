alternatives for future library catalogs' a cost model'
    final report of the library catalog cost model project prepared
    for the association of research libraries. under arl
    sponsorship, king research, inc., developed a library catalog
    cost model to assist 72 participating libraries in comparing
    the cost of alternative future forms of catalogue, emphasising
    the cost of implementing aacr2. 68 libraries prepared inputs
    characterising their costs and modes of operation, and these
    were used, with the model, to compute costs of alternative
    catalogue forms. inputs and outputs of the model were highly
    variable. costs of implementing aacr2 were estimated to be 4-7%
    of the total cost of developing and maintaining a catalogue.
    the model can be a useful planning, budgeting and staffing
    tool, and may be seen as a prototype, adaptable to project
    costs of other library operations, especially acquisitions.
    recommendations are made for future model development.
