library journal and choice: a review of reviews.
    discusses the methods by which library journal and choice
    choose books for review and their reviewers. presents the
    results of a computerised content analysis of 1,300 reviews
    from each journal, randomly selected from issues published in
    1978. concludes that key decisions are made by the editors
    rather than the reviewers; reviews are relatively uncritical;
    there is little difference between reviews by college teachers
    and those by librarians; and that unsigned reviews are no more
    critical than signed ones.
