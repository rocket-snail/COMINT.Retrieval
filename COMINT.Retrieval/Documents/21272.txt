inflexible control system. complains of the necessity for
    norwegian branch libraries to make separate annual returns to
    satisfy the county library and the national library office. 1
    coordinated report compiled by the central library should be
    sufficient. separate returns can be positively misleading,
    since, for instance, books transferred or circulating within a
    library system cannot be accurately recorded. puts forward
    proposals to reduce the time spent on statistics; the type
    required to justify the library's place in society were to be
    the responsibility of a salaried committee of librarians.
    bookstock standards would also be more viable if formulated for
    1 authority, with the necessary divisions into central library
    and branches. the status and function of the county librarians'
    conference is queried, and the right of workers' organisations
    to representation on the national library council is
    stressed.
