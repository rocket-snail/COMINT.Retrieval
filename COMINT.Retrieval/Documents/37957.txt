staffing for reader services in polytechnic libraries.
    (mls dissertation). 5 uk polytechnic libraries (at manchester,
    oxford, hatfield, trent, and coventry (lanchester)) were
    surveyed with special reference to the influence of multi-site
    operation on the effectiveness of reader services. the
    libraries placed much emphasis on the role of subject
    specialists in maintaining good user relations. all found it
    easier to build up such relations in smallsite rather than
    large central libraries. opinions and policies concerning
    subject specialist duties varied. alternatives to subject
    specialist systems were not favoured. financial constraints
    were having a profound effect on the efforts of polytechnics to
    concentrate their work on 1 campus.
