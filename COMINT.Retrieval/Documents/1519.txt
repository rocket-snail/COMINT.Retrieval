developing an evaluation strategy: a client research
    model. the wisconsin cancer information service, a specialised
    telephone i&r service, designed a 17-question client survey
    to evaluate' (1) adequacy of office operations; (2) service
    impact; (3) client satisfaction; and (4) demographic
    distribution of population served. their research methodology
    was developed to assure selection of a representative sample
    and high response rate through random sampling and 3-fold
    follow-up procedure. the wcis study objectives and methodology
    can be used, with modifications, by other i&r services to
    meet particular needs and to fit within different programme
    structures.
