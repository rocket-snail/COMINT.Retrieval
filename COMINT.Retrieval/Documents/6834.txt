is automation necessary?. in the netherlands supporters
    of the introduction of automated systems in library service
    point to the computerised loans systems already in operation in
    libraries in rotterdam, amsterdam and elsewhere, and to the
    growing number of libraries making use of computerised
    cataloguing networks. opponents of automation point to the
    social implications of the replacement of man by machines. a
    further group suggests that the use of automation in libraries
    depends on the nature of the work to be done and asserts that
    certain technical aids, such as the telephone and the
    photocopier, are regarded as essential to a library's services.
    in spite of unemployment it is becoming increasingly difficult
    to attract and retain staff for certain tasks in libraries. in
    such cases automation can be of great assistance.
