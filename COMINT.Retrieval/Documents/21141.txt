longitudinal magneto hydrodynamic waves alfvens theory
    indicates that the velocity of sound waves in a conducting
    fluid will be changed by application of a strong magnetic field
    theory of this effect is presented for a fluid with finite
    conductivity and is applied to predict effects that should be
    obtained in propagation of sound in hg in a very strong field
    in sea water under influence of the geomagnetic field
