an analogue solution of the continuity equation of the
    ionospheric f region an electromechanical analogue computer is
    used to solve an idealized f layer continuity equation the
    results show how the layer above the f peak is mainly
    controlled by vertical diffusion of ionization and below the
    peak by the production and loss processes the machine can also
    simulate the effect of a solar eclipse
