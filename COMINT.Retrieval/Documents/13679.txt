ionospheric drift measurements in the long wave range as
    a contribution to the problem of general circulation of the
    upper atmosphere spaced receiver measurements at of ionospheric
    drift at altitude indicate distinct seasonal reversals in the
    circulation of the upper atmosphere small diurnal variations
    are superimposed on the normal drifts and an additional ns
    component is observed during magnetic storms
