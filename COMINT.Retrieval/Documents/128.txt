a cathode ray tube analogue to serial digital converter
    small fluctuations of the cr tube screen equilibrium potential
    cause proportionate fluctuations in the steady secondary
    emission current arriving at a collector anode the parameters
    affecting changes in this current are investigated using an
    external electrode on the cr tube face to modulate the screen
    potential experiments are described to determine minimum
    electrode width and spacing consistent with the production of a
    discrete pulse output from each electrode when a pattern is
    scanned
