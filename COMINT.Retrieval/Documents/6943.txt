general method of analyzing bilateral two port networks
    from three arbitrary impedance measurements the method consists
    in mapping stereographically on the surface of the riemann unit
    sphere three given output quantities and their corresponding
    measured input quantities the fixed points and the multiplier
    of the normal canonic form of the linear fractional
    transformation representing the network can be obtained by
    using kleins three dimensional generalization of the pascal
    theorem the different constructions of the geometric part can
    also be performed analytically simple numerical examples are
    worked out
