the australian and new zealand response to ccny grants
    for library development. australian and new zealand
    librarianship had much in common in the 1930s, stemming from a
    common uk tradition, yet each country made quite a different
    response to the carnegie corporation of new york aid programme
    to stimulate library development. the new zealand response was
    much more positive and many developments took place in the
    1930s-40s; in australia, some equivalent developments were not
    accomplished until the 1960s. examines the reasons for
    this.
