the use of public libraries in quebec in relation to
    certain inbuilt variables. report of a study carried out at the
    university of montreal in 1980-81, to investigate under-usage,
    and the effects of such elements in the internal system of
    library organisation and operation as the number of documents
    available, staffing arrangements, and hours of opening. data
    were collected from a sample of the total population of
    potential users by interview and questionnaire, and analysed
    manually. details are given of calculations to establish the
    rate of under-use, and the significance of the effect of the
    variables tested. findings showed hours of opening to have the
    greatest influence on use. concludes that ultimately the level
    of staffing is crucial in promoting library use, and recommends
    that government regulations on library personnel take this into
    account.
