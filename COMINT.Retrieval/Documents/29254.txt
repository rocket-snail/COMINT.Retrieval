    independence, education and libraries were dominated by 2
    colonial powers, the arabs in the 11th century and the french
    in the 19th. since independence in 1960 education and libraries
    have developed to try and overcome illiteracy. the former
    library of the french institute for black africa became the

    collection of material and administration of the national
    policy for libraries. libraries have been established in
    schools and in institutions for higher education and research.
