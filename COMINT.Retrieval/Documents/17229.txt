approximate calculation of the relaxation process and
    time delay in the multivibrator calculations are presented
    based on representation of the valve characteristic curves by
    third degree polynomials a delay of about sec between the
    initiation of instability and the commencement of the anode
    pulse is found for a particular circuit using type ef
    pentodes
