user fluctuation as the totality of user movement.
    statistics produced by kopenick district library in berlin
    between 1969-79 show that each year a considerable number of
    new users are registered although the total number of readers
    grows only slowly. these figures reflect national trends. the
    use of the term fluctuation in this context is discussed. users
    may leave a library for various reasons' unavoidably, through
    illness or death; from social necessity, as when transferring
    from the children's to the adult library; for socially
    acceptable reasons, e.g. moving house, military service;
    undesirably, because they find the library service
    unsatisfactory. analysis of all available statistics shows that
    2/3 of the kopenick residents do not use the library at all,
    which again reflects a national trend.
