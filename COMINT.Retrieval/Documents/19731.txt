on the cooling of the upper atmosphere after sunset
    cooling in the and regions of the ionosphere is investigated
    theoretically assuming that heat transfer takes place only by
    conduction at a time after sunset the temperature is unchanged
    at altitudes below at a height of the maximum drop is there
    should be an appreciable increase of ion density in the layer
    but this will be offset except in equatorial regions by
    downward diffusion
