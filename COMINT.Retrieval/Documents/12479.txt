a high efficiency high quality audio frequency power
    amplifier the circuit uses a type valve as phase inverter
    amplifier driver stage direct coupled to two output beam
    tetrodes operating in class b push pull with db of feedback the
    output transformer has a bifilar wound primary and the feedback
    winding is electrostatically shielded from the secondary but
    very closely coupled to it full power output is at frequencies
    design of the circuits and performance details are
