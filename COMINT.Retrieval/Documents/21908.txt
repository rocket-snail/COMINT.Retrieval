whistlers in the antarctic observations made from at
    scott base showed considerable activity including bonks tweeks
    long and short whistlers and periods of strong sferics but no
    dawn chorus it is probable that the whistlers are propagated
    from lower latitude regions first along the appropriate
    magnetic flux line and then by ionospheric reflection
