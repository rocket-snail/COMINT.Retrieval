the physical principles of a negative mass amplifier
    negative effective masses for relatively low energies may be
    obtained if the energy contours are reentrant near the edge of
    the frequency band as in the case for heavy holes in germanium
    and certain other semiconductors with degenerate band edges
    operation at frequencies up to mm is envisaged
