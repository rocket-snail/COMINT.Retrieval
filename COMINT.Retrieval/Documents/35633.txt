solution of the field problem of the germanium gyrator
    analysis is presented for the hall effect gyrator described by
    mason et al of treated as a two dimensional boundary value
    problem and assuming that only one type of carrier is involved
    and that there is no surface recombination the efficiency is
    calculated as a function of electrode size shape of boundary
    and magnetic field strength some of the results have been
    checked experimentally with fields up to gauss the calculations
    have been carried out for even higher fields and may be useful
    for studying materials with higher mobilities such as
