designing optical mark forms for reference statistics.
    data are recorded on optical mark forms using a soft pencil to
    place a series of marks in specified areas, a technique that is
    commonly used on examination answer sheets. the data are then
    available for computer tabulation and analysis. reference-desk
    statistics can efficiently be collected in machine-readable
    form by using such a technique. information relevant to the
    design of an optical mark form is presented along with
    important software considerations. the overriding concern when
    designing an optical mark form to be used at the reference desk
    is to provide the ability to record all necessary information
    while requiring as few marks as possible. useful data
    categories are identified, and figures illustrate how data can
    be recorded for each category. presents information resulting
    from the design and use of such a programme at the university
