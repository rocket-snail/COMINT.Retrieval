the relationships between the secular change and the non
    dipole fields the drift and decay contributions to the secular
    variation have been estimated from isomagnetic and isoporic
    charts for in canada the westward drift in recent years was
    found to be significantly smaller than the world wide average
    relations are obtained between the gaussian coefficients in the
    spherical harmonic analyses of the earths main field and the
    secular variation it is shown that one half of this variation
    is produced by westward drift and that the decay terms are
    unimportant
