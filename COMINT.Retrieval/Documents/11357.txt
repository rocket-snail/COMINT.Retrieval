improving the system of methodological guidance.
    methodological guidance is an essential feature of soviet
    librarianship. the involvement of the government in the
    provision of this guidance can be traced back to the 1920s.
    today it has reached a higher level of efficiency in acting
    through the centralised library networks set up throughout the
    ussr. the ways in which the library serving as the guidance
    centre within a network can influence the work of its dependent
    libraries can be clearly defined, and illustrated in tabular
    form, but there is still a need for more cooperation and better
    training for staff working in these centres.
