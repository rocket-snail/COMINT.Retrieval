critical examination of the theory of plasmas based on
    mean free path in the light of the method based on the
    distribution function derived by solving boltzmanns equation
    discussion indicates that the distribution function method is
    more suitable than the mean free path method for calculating
    the conductivity of anisotropic plasmas velocity analysis of
    thermionic emission from single crystal tungsten it is
    suggested that the departure from a maxwellian distribution
    observed by hutson is due to the finite resolution of the
