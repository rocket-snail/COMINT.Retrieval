answering the challenge of teletext, viewdata systems and
    other fast growing communications, such as home computers.
    newspapers are facing challenges from the new media of
    teletext, viewdata systems, and home computers. teletext
    provides news immediately, simply, conveniently, and
    inexpensively. however, it does not provide the browse and scan
    options of newspapers. of greater potential impact is the
    development of viewdata systems which use the television,
    telephone, and computer so that on-line searching can be done
    from the home. the system can also be modified to use a home
    computer rather than a television screen. changes in how people
    spend their leisure time and their disposable income, combined
    with the stagnation of newspaper readership and the
    increasingly important role of information in society, suggest
    that newspapers should look into new options. report not
