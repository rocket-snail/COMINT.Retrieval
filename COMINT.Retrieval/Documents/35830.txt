the crisis of danish specialised bibliographies. argues
    that, whereas the danish national bibliography is in no danger
    as it is subsidised through the library centre and acquired
    widely by all types of library, the selective, specialised
    bibliographies are given low priority. the national
    bibliography has traditionally formed the basis of compilation
    of selective bibliographies, but with automation it is less
    suitable for subject searches. gives examples of specialised
    bibliographies whose selections are not based on the evaluation
    of qualified people of the total production within a subject.
    the danish joint bibliographic committee set up on the
    instigation of unesco lacks influence on the production of
    specialised bibliographies. urges the library centre and public
    libraries to pay as much attention to the analytical, danish
    specialised bibliographies as they do to the national
    bibliography.
