a new method for the solution of a problem of diffraction
    of electromagnetic plane waves at an unlimited rectilinear slit
    and related problems using the method described a good
    approximation to the exact solution of the diffraction problem
    can be obtained for normally incident plane waves of wavelength
    much smaller than or equal to the width of the slit
