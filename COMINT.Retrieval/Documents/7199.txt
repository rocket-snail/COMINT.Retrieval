a note on the cause of sudden ionization anomalies in
    regions remote from high altitude nuclear bursts the sudden
    changes in vlf propagation characteristics associated with the
    nuclear explosions over johnston island are attributed to bomb
    induced ionization in the ionospheric d layer it is suggested
    tht this ionization is caused by particles resulting from the
    decay of fission neutrons
