electron interaction in solids general formulation a
    general hamiltonian formalism is developed to treat from first
    principles the motion of electrons in solids including their
    mutual coulomb interaction it is shown that under suitable
    circumstances plasmons the quanta of the plasma oscillations
    represent a well defined elementary excitation of the solid the
    existence criterion for plasmons is found to be a high
    electronic polarizability after the plasmon modes are separated
    out the remaining electron interaction is found to be screened
    with a range of the order of the interelectron spacing the
    usefulness of this effective hamiltonian for the calculation of
    the electronic energy levels and cohesive energy in solids is
    discussed briefly
