space charge field emission and the ionic condenser high
    es fields measured at the electrodes during gas discharge
    experiments in h indicate that the mechanism initiating a flash
    of intermittent glow is field emission from the cathode or from
    the negative space charge the hypothesis is applied to the
    experimental results of other workers and is confirmed it is
    shown to provide simple explanations for many gas discharge
    phenomena it is suggested that the measured high fields are due
    to concentrated space charges forming ionic condensers with the
    electrodes or within the gas itself in the form of stationary
    striations
