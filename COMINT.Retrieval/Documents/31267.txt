financial impacts of networking and resource sharing.
    library cooperatives will evolve more into automated library
    networks which are generally more cost-effective, less
    labour-intensive, and provide more and better service. the more
    successful us networks are those where the member libraries
    have a significant commitment with funds from their local
    libraries' operating budgets and which view the services as an
    integral part of their essential operations. cost-effective
    networks are characterised by greater competition, less state
    and federal control, and more research and development. the
    network's economic revolution for public libraries is beginning
    to occur where automated networks have extended services
    directly to the users in their homes.
