terrestrial extremely low frequency noise spectrum in the
    presence of exponential ionospheric conductivity profiles
    expressions are derived which are derived which are applicable
    to a nonhomogeneous ionosphere the exponential model gives
    slightly lower resonant frequencies and less damping of the
    resonant peaks than a sharply bounded model of agreement with
    measurement is improved
