lunar tides in the ionosphere f layer at dakar hourly
    records of and for the years have been analysed maximum
    variations and times of occurrence of maxima are tabulated for
    the different seasons the semi diurnal component is predominant
    except in summer during winter the tidal variations of and have
    amplitudes of and respectively the phases and amplitudes are
    considerably different from those observed at other tropical

    layer at dakar is very thick in summer the ionization maximum
    occurs at the equinoxes and not in winter
