numerical calculation of filter circuits with tchebycheff
    characteristics after the method of w cauer formulae for
    tchebycheff type filters are derived from those previously
    given for filters with generalized parameters of three types of
    antimetrical filter are considered the formulae necessary for
    numerical calculation of both symmetrical and antimetrical
    normalized filters are derived and applied to examples by
    suitable frequency transformation the normal type of
    tchebycheff filter can be dealt with a complete set of curves
    is provided for evaluation of the required parameters
