the organization of structured files a data file is an
    integral part of a data processing system. in many systems, the
    selection of an organization for the data within the file can
    be critical to the system's operating efficiency. this paper
    provides the systems designer with an information source which
    describes ten techniques that may be employed for organizing
    structured data. the characteristics of the organizations
    described are application independent, thus providing the
    designer with a reference which allows him to limit the number
    of file organizations he must consider for his system. july,
