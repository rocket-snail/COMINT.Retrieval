an associative interactive dictionary for online
    bibliographic searching. a prototype associative interactive
    dictionary (aid) system has been developed to assist in search
    strategy formulation on a large operational free-text on-line
    bibliographic retrieval system. the primary design objective is
    the automatic generation and display of related terms, broader
    and narrower terms, and other semantic associations for given
    search concepts. the associative text analysis procedures rely
    on statistical frequency distribution information about term
    occurrences in the data base and in retrieved sets of
    documents.
