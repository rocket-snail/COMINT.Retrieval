thermoelements and thermoelectric dc generators detailed
    theoretical investigation of thermodynamic efficiency taking
    account of the various thermoelectric effects and changes in
    resistivity and thermal conductivity higher efficiencies should
    be obtainable than those indicated by other authors problems of
    construction and mechanical strength are also considered
