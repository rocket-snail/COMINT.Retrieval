variable inductance and its application in frequency
    sweep oscillators the modulation principle described consists
    in varying the voltage across an inductor while the current
    through it is maintained constant alternations of the control
    grid voltage of a pentode cause anode and screen grid currents
    to vary in magnitude developing a voltage variation across an
    anode inductor coupled to the inductor in the cathode circuit
    the current through l is maintained constant by an alternating
    voltage applied to the suppressor grid a frequency shift of
    around is attainable the use of the method for fm and frequency
    sweep tuning is indicated
