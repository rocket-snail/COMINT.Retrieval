examination of wastage and protection against theft;
    experiences from gothenburg city library. when gothenburg city
    library introduced bums, (bibliotekstjanst utlanings och
    mediakontroll system) which necessitated a total stocktaking of
    the books listed in the card catalogue, it was found that 25%
    of the stock was missing. spot checks after bums was
    established showed losses of 4% annually, or 10,000 volumes.
    introduction of a theft prevention system was combined with a
    new computer check-out system. after study visits, the
    checkpoint by-pass system was found most suitable for a public
    library of gothenburg's size. a metal strip is embedded in the
    book which releases a sound signal if the book is taken out
    unregistered. after some teething troubles the system is
    working well and the staff handle guilty borrowers without
    difficulty. it is hoped to obtain 80% security.
