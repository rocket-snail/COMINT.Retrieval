the chances of a university education within the
    framework of communication sciences for librarians in public
    libraries. in berlin the library school is now completely
    integrated into the university as part of the communication
    science faculty, the 1st time that this has occurred in
    germany. objections to university status for librarianship
    courses were formerly made on the grounds that the
    librarianship courses occupy only 6 semesters where other
    university courses require 8 or 9 and that a university course
    would provide inadequate practical training. if librarianship
    is to be regarded as part of communication science new
    theoretic fields must be developed which will affect
    librarianship training. librarians must be trained in critical
    media selection and information dissemination; in public
    librarianship personal communication between staff and readers
    must be improved to counteract the impersonal effects of
    increasing centralisation. librarians need a better general
    education and knowledge of connected academic subjects like
    sociology and psychology.
