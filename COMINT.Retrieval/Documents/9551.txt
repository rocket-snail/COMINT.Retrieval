atomic negative ion photodetachment cross section and
    affinity measurements the spectral distributions of the and
    cross sections for photodetachment have been measured the
    measurements are consistent with the theory of chandrasekhar a
    curve has been fitted to the results for the threshold of this
    cross section the affinity of is found to be electron volts no
    evidence is found for resonance at the threshold or for the
    existence of excited ions the apparatus is described in
    detail
