notes on the theory of magnetic storms a non mathematical
    account is given of the model problems and their solutions by
    which chapman and ferraro have sought to illustrate some
    aspects of the theory of magnetic storms these problems are
    here used to develop a qualitative solution of the motition of
    an infinite neutral ionized plane sheet of gas or of a
    succession of such sheets towards a unidirectional magnetic
    field whose intensity decreases as an inverse power of the
    distance from an axis to which the sheet is parallel the gas in
    the centre approaches to a minimum distance from the axis and
    then recedes again the gas far to either side moves onward with
    little distortion between these central and outer parts there
    are two strips of the sheet whose ions and electrons separate
    from each other under the influence of the magnetic field
    partly because these strips become much extended and reduced to
    low density some charges are deviated away to infinity others
    are captured by the field and build up a westward electric
    current to which is ascribed the main phase of a magnetic
