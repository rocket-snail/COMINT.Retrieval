investigations of laboratory production of printed
    circuits for communication equipment a brief report is
    presented on the practical aspects of very small scale
    production of printed circuits using the simplest tools only th
    electrical and mechanical properties of different chassis
    materials are tabulated as well as the properties and the
    treatments required by seven different conducting materials
    applications described include the production of components an
    amplifier a rc oscillator and a heterodyne receiver for the
    frequency band this receiver contains no inductive components
