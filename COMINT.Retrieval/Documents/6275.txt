resistance as dissipation into many reactive circuits
    landau damping and nyquists noise theorem nonradiative
    dissipation is not a loss of energy but its dispersal into a
    large number of degrees of freedom resistance can be simulated
    by purely reactive elements this lead to an understanding of
    landau damping and nyquists noise theorem
