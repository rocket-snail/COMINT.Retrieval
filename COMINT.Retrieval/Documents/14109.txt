the solion an electrochemical transducer the operation of
    this device is based on concentration polarization where an
    electric current passing through an electrochemical system is
    limited by dif usion and convection variables such as fluid f
    ow the solion consists of a small cylinder of p astic material
    containing a potassium iodide solution in which two or more
    electrodes are immersed polarization is effected by a battery
    when the unit is stimulated by light heat sound pressure or
    movement the resultant hydraulic flow within the cell produces
    a current output these r actions are reversible
