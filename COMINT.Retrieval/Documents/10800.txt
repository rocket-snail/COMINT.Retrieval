particular problems in the training of higher-qualified
    library and research staff. many library schools suffer from
    having too few qualified lecturers, over-loaded and ill-planned
    syllabuses, and from paying too little attention to
    post-graduate work. until these faults are remedied there is
    little hope of improving significantly the further education of
    librarians. there is a need for a more general syllabus, so
    that students emerge with detailed knowledge of a wide range of
    library activities. post-graduate students need to be more
    carefully selected and their dissertations more closely
    supervised.
