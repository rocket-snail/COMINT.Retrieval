neighbourhood information centres and community workers.
    examines reasons why community workers in the uk get involved
    in neighbourhood information and advice centres, describes the
    form that their involvement often takes and tries to show how
    unrealistic expectations on the part of some community workers
    have limited and disguised the achievements of these
    centres.
