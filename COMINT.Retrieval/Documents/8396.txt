the legal position of polytechnic ('fachhochschul-')
    libraries after the new polytechnic (university) laws. in 1979
    new university laws were passed which affected polytechnic
    ('fachhochschul-') laws and the legal position of polytechnic
    libraries. although polytechnics differ in form slightly from
    one state to another within west germany, there are some
    general points in the new laws which influence polytechnic
    libraries in the same way. the status of the libraries has
    become more precise; they are recognised as central working
    units. the libraries now have the right to make decisions
    concerning budget expenditure and the allocation of new staff.
    the polytechnic library has thus become an independent
    institution with its own duties and rights within the
    polytechnic. however, libraries still depend on the size of
    allocations from the central polytechnic bodies. final
    decisions on the choice of literature acquisition can still
    only be made by the relevant polytechnic department with the li
    brary merely acting in an advisory capacity.
