    report of a working visit. the authors toured south africa in
    aug-sept 80, visiting 42 schools, 8 universities, and 6
    colleges of education. presents their impressions of school
    library provision-all schools for each racial group possess a
    library room (usually with an adjacent projection room for
    class use) and full-time teacher-librarian; book and materials
    provision is average to good; provincial authorities exercise
    considerable control over selection and provision; local
    initiative does not seem to be encouraged; and school libraries
    are used mainly for formal teaching and drilling. discusses the
    effect of the tour on the authors' concept of their profession
    and the uk situation.
