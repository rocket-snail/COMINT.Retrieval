the algebraic theory of linear transmission networks the
    theory is based on the series combination of two networks with
    equal numbers of input and output terminals to form a semi
    group the theory is developed in a series of definitions
    theorems and proofs fundamental properties of transmission
    networks are derived and principal types of network are
    classified by means of a factorization theorem a simple
    criterion for symmetry can be derived the necessary and
    sufficient conditions for the existence of a characteristic
    impedance are determined the theory provides a concise
    definition and a method of rigorous treatment of the general
    transmission line
