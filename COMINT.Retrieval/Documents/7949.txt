a method of designing transistor trigger circuits a
    fairly general technique was developed after the war for
    designing circuits that would operate with valves having
    characteristics which varied within fairly wide tolerances
    without component adjustments being necessary when valves were
    changed a similar technique is outlined for point contact
    transistors this is based on valve circuit technique and
    particularly on the analogy between the characteristics of
    transistors and pentodes basic pule circuits considered include
    state devices timing circuits counters and relaxation
    oscillators their application in digital computers is reviewed
    in detail
