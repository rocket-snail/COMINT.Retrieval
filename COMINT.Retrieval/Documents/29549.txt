precise measurement of the microwave absorption
    frequencies of the oxygen molecule and the velocity of light
    ten microwave absorption frequencies of the oxygen molecule in
    the region have been measured with an accuracy of about the
    result is interpreted by successfully refining the existing
    theory comparing the resultant value of the rotational constant
    b with the value obtained in ultraviolet spectra the velocity
    of light is calculated to be km
