scientific information strategy of chinoin. in hungary,
    pharmaceutical works devote much of their income to the
    development of new compounds. patents may only be issued for
    new materials and methods, so information on patents and
    special literature must be up to date. for this the chinoin
    technical library uses classic and modern computerised
    services. the library subscribes to only 212 journals, but uses
    derwent manual card and abstracting services, and the 2chemical
    abstracts1 search system. retrospective searching is carried
    out manually through, for example, 2chemical abstracts1. it is
    proposed to cooperate directly with the computer station at the
    office for system analysis of the national committee for
    technical development. the establishment of a data bank,
    including new compounds of chinoin represents a further
    development of information within the system.
