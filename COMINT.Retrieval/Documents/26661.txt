reduction of the loss in ferrite materials in the
    microwave region the loss in microwave gyrators of the type
    comprising a ferrite rod inside a circular waveguide surrounded
    by a solenoid producing an axial magnetic field has in certain
    cases been reduced by application of an auxiliary transverse
    static magnetic field
