teletext systems are approaching with caution. comments
    on the report by the teletext committee, set up in 1978 by the
    prime minister's office to examine whether there was any
    justification for introducing 1 or more teletext systems in
    denmark and to evaluate the costs involved. the report
    recommends the introduction of text-tv, which is regarded as a
    useful and cheap means of texting tv programmes and
    distributing general information. teledata's direct connection
    to data bases with unlimited information makes it especially
    useful for information searches. it can also be used by
    libraries for location of books, loan information, and readers'
    advice. other uses include' updating of reference works and all
    social information of a changing nature' timetables, address
    lists, etc. however, teledata is very costly and demands a high
    degree of adaptability by users. its introduction as a
    permanent public service should therefore await the results of
    the planned experiment expected in 1983 and sho uld also be
    discussed by the media commission.
