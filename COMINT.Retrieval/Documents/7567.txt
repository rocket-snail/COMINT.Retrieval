libraries' role in information on developing countries.
    while all the scandinavian countries contribute to aid for
    developing countries, the financial resources devoted to
    information services are comparatively small. the 14th
    scandinavian library conference is urged to take up the
    library's role in information for developing countries, which
    is not merely a question of statistical economic and social
    documentation, but covers all forms of literary and artistic
    expression. some swedish public libraries have already provided
    facilities for discussing current topics in the field, in
    cooperation with local study groups and sida, the swedish
    organisation for international aid. a seminar for librarians
    was held in summer 77 on kenya and tanzania, and a unesco
    seminar is producing a handbook of practical hints for
    librarians on information regarding developing countries. a
    pilot project on boras has been granted finance to stock a
    special 'corner' of developing country information, and hopes t
    o man it continuously for enquirers.
