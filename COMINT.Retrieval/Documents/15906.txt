simplified solution of phase shift networks the method is
    particularly applicable to phase shift circuits in rc
    oscillators and selective amplifiers the arbitrary initial
    assumption is made that all reactive network elements can be
    treated algebraically as resistances ie as scalar quantities
    this enables mesh equations to be written down and solved
    simply the results being then interpreted in terms of the
    complex quantities involved three illustrative examples are
    worked out
