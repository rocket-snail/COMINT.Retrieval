am fm analogy a method is described for analysing the
    response of a circuit to a fm signal and for determining
    spectral distribution based on considering the equivalent
    signal produced by a series of sequentially pulsed am carriers
    whose frequencies range between the extremes of the fm
    deviation the required fm response is obtained as the synthesis
    of the responses to these separate am signals both aperiodic
    and periodic signals are considered the method is particularly
    appropriate and gives exact results when the modulating
    waveform is rectangular for other cases the results are
    approximate
