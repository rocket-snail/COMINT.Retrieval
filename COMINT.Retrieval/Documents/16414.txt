index system for personal reference sources. several
    norwegian business information organisations cooperated during
    1974-76 to develop a computerised reference system (usis) for
    linking enquirers with personal, not bibliographical, reference
    sources. people produce knowledge; the human brain is an
    unsurpassed 'data base'; and precise information can be
    requested and obtained through conversation. the basic
    reference unit chosen was the specialist department or
    institution, and in apr 79 1,200 reference sources were
    registered, representing 550 norwegian institutions. indexing
    of sources is based on annual reports, checked by the
    institutions. institutions can be approached individually if
    the problem requires precise definition, or the index used
    alone via a computer terminal. data on personal reference
    sources must be constantly updated. similar systems exist in
    other countries, and the idea could be extended' all users of
    computer terminals (8,000 in norway in 1978, estimated to reach
    2 0,000 in 1985) are potential clients. possible dangers of
    monopoly, abuse, or takeover by a foreign power should be
    technically avoidable.
