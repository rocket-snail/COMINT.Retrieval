librarianship will be my vocation. discusses
    librarianship education on secondary school level. the 1st part
    is an analysis of the results of an enquiry, carried out among
    4th year students of one of these schools, as to students'
    motivation, information provided to them on which they based
    their decision to select this vocation, which branch of
    librarianship they are interested in, and how they assess their
    4 year course. the next part deals with practical work in
    libraries in which the 4th year students take part. the course
    is completed by final examinations which count as equivalent to
    final exams at an ordinary secondary school.
