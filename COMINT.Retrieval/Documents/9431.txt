the diploma in academic librarianship: a critical study.
    reply to an article in open 12 (9) sept 80, 397-404 (see
    81/1865) in which professional education for the diploma in
    academic librarianship in the netherlands was criticised for
    the lack of a practical base. however, students following the
    course in academic librarianship at the p.a. tiele school of
    librianship in the hague receive lectures from practising
    academic librarians and the syllabus is reviewed annually in
    consultation with students and with staff from academic
    libraries. in addition the variety of posts in academic
    libraries open to students completing the course makes it
    impractical to suit the syllabus to a single type of library.
    it is also clear that too little is known about the course by
    practising librarians.
