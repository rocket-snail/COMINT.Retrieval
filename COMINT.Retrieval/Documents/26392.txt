the emission polar diagram of the radio frequency
    radiation from sunspots the variation in received sunspot
    radiation with solar rotation was determined from a statistical
    analysis of observations made over a number of years half power
    widths of the radiation pattern of an average sunspot derived
    from this analysis are for frequencies respectively results
    indicate that the lifetime of the radiation sources is shorter
    for the lower frequencies the lifetime is comparable with that
    of a visible spot
