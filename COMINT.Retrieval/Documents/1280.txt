some studies of the upper atmosphere in the auroral zone
    observations show close correlation between blackouts complete
    blanketing of f by e slant and geomagnetic ba y disturbances
    the height of the absorbing region responsible for the daytime
    polar blackout appeared to be lower than when the event
    occurred at night to explain these results the effect on the
    ionosphere of x rays generated by solar particles is
    discussed
