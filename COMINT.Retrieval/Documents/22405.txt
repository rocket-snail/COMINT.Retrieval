a framework for computer network planning. a framework is
    presented for planning a network for a computer service
    delivery system. this framework makes explicit a planning
    matrix for factoring the computer needs of the users in
    manageable units and develops the parameters for deciding on a
    suitable network to meet the political and economic
    requirements of management. the matrix gives the basis for
    studying alternative configurations for merging the individual
    needs of the users. for studying configurations beyond a
    stand-alone system, the concept of a node is introduced,
    permitting the consideration of a set of 6 categories of
    parameters. viewpoints of network structures having various
    degrees of organisational complexity are defined in terms of
    the nodal parameters.
