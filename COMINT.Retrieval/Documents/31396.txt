electromagnetic induction in a two layer earth the theory
    developed by is extended to determine the induced field on the
    surface of a medium whose conductivity is a function of depth
    the results are applied to evaluate the field induced when an
    oscillating magnetic dipole is placed on the surface of a flat
    two layer earth
