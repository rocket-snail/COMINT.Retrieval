party-in-power as a determinant of state aid to public
    libraries. this study measures changes over nearly 30 years in
    the amount of aid provided by state governments to public
    libraries and the relationship of these changes to the party in
    power. aid is examined at 2 levels' the 1st views the party in
    power at the inception of state aid, the 2nd notes the party
    when a significant increase is made in aid levels. neither
    condition produces a definitive relationship to the party in
    power as defined by the study, and progress in aid seems nearly
    evenly divided between the ascendant parties, or at least in
    proportion to the dominant party across the usa at the time.
