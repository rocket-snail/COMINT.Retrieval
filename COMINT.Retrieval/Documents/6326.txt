results of observations of scattering of rf waves by
    electron inhomogeneities of the solar corona results similar to
    those reported by machine and smith were obtained in
    observations of the occultations of june and the observations
    were made at wavelengths between and in interferometer base
    lengths of and were used at giving beam widths of and
    respectively rapid amplitude changes were noticed those
    associated with changes within a few seconds are believed to be
    due to the relativistic motion of electron inhomogeneities
    those of the order of a few minutes to corpuscular
    streams
