teaching and training for on-line work in libraries.
    final report of a project which examined the methods of
    teaching and training relating to on-line work in libraries
    with special reference to cost. the cost of using outhouse data
    bases (lockheed dialog and blaise marc) within programmes
    designed to make maximum use of inhouse packages was
    investigated. inhouse programmes are essential for practice
    work-the blaise editor would be prohibitively expensive to use.
    software for handling marc was found to be generally
    inadequate. the hewlett-packard 2645a display station was found
    acceptable for training purposes.
