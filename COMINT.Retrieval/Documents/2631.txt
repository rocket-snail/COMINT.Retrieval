an examination of book buyers and library users. very few
    people either only buy their books or only obtain them from a
    library and many people buy books as often as they borrow them.
    library users who borrow few books buy a larger proportion of
    their books than library users who borrow many books. however,
    whereas over 1/2 the population of germany buy books, only
    about 1/4 use public libraries. investigations have revealed
    that important influences on behaviour regarding the use of
    books include the home background, school and general social
    environment. an individual's sense of values also plays its
    part, often influenced by the media and communication
    possibilities. perhaps the main influence is the social
    learning process and an individual's own attitude towards it.
    there are still numerous unexplored possibilities for
    influencing children and adults in their use of books.
