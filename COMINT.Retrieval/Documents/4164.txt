performance of height-balanced trees this paper presents
    the results of simulations that investigate the performance of
    height-balanced (hb[k]) trees. it is shown that the only
    statistic of hb[1] trees (avl trees) that is a function of the
    size of the tree is the time to search for an item in the tree.
    for sufficiently large trees, the execution times of all
    procedures for maintaining hb[1] trees are independent of the
    size of the tree. in particular, an average of .465
    restructures are required per insertion, with an average of
    2.78 nodes revisited to restore the hb[1] property; an average
    of .214 restructures are required per deletion, with an average
    of 1.91 nodes revisited to restore the hb[1] property.
    moreover,the execution times of procedures for maintaining
    hb[k] trees, for k>1, are also independent of the size of
    the tree except for the average number of nodes revisited on a
    delete operation in order to restore the hb[k] property on
    trace back. the cost of maintaining hb[k] trees drops sharply
    as the allowable imbalance (k) increases. both analytical and
    experimental results that show the cost of maintaining hb[k]
    trees as a function of k are discussed. january, 1976 karlton,
