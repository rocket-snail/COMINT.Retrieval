electronically tuned wide range oscillator a hel
    transmission line with ge diodes mounted at intervals of is
    used as tuning element in a colpitts circuit tuning is
    accomplished by applying a switching pulse to a selected diode
    to short the line the five tuning positions give frequencies of
    about and respectively the length of helical line required is
    very much less than that of a parallel conductor line for the
    same frequency satisfactory operation of an experimental model
    was achieved at switching rates up to pulses sec
