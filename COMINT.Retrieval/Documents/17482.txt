relationships between aurora and sporadic echoes at
    barrow alaska report of observations of visual aurora made
    simultaneously with ionospheric soundings during the
    observations for three nights are described in detail analysis
    of the results shows that echoes at frequencies tend to occur
    when the aurora is near the zenith that there is a direct
    relation between the brightness of inactive aurorae and the top
    frequency of echoes and that echo ranges correspond with
    estimated slant ranges of visible auroral forms
