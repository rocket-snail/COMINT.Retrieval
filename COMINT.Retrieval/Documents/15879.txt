theory of electron phonon interactions the theory of the
    interaction of electrons and acoustic phonons in nonpolar
    crystals has been formulated in terms of a new set of basis
    states whose wave functions are essentially bloch functions
    that deform with the lattice the major part of the interaction
    may then be calculated in terms of ten be calculated in terms
    of the strain tensor rather than the displacement of the
    lattice a result of the theory is a generalization of the
    deformation potential theorem
