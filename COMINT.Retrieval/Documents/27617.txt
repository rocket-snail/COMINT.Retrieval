fine graduation of the timing pulse generator disk of an
    electronic computer the construction is described of a disk
    providing the synchronizing pulses for the storage system of a
    digital computer the nonferromagnetic disk of about diameter
    carries a thin layer of nickel near the rim the layer is cut by
    radial grooves of width and there are five concentric tracks
    with differing numbers of grooves the outer track thus consists
    of ferromagnetic teeth which at rev min generate pulses at a
    repetition frequency of about details of the dividing and
    engraving machinery are given
