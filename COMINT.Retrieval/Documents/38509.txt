a curve analyzer and general purpose graphical computer
    the analogue computer described comprises five photoelectric
    curve followers two integrators nine adding amplifiers and a
    pen recorder the independent variable is represented by a low
    alternating voltage increasing linearly with time the from of
    the equation is determined by the connections between the units
    and the values of constants are set by potentiometers
