millimeter wave absorption in superconducting aluminum
    available experimental evidence indicates that for wavelengths
    above the absorption is different for the normal and the
    superconducting states measurements are reported on a high
    purity al waveguide the ratio of surface resistivities for the
    superconducting and normal states is plotted as a function of
    temperature for various values the results are discussed in
    relation to alternative energy gap models
