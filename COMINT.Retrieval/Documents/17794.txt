union-library relationship. contribution to an issue
    devoted to papers presented at the canadian library association
    annual conference, june 81. examines the impact of unions on
    canadian libraries, and presents the results of a survey of
    library staff organisations in anglophone canada. discusses how
    library managers can try to ensure that their ability to manage
    the library remains as unimpaired as possible after
    unionisation. argues that the service function is the aspect of
    library operations most endangered by the impact of unions, and
    urges those responsible to ensure that the service goal of
    libraries remains as unfettered as possible by a collective
    agreement.
