some properties of mathieu and related functions
    exemplified by the regenerative modulation process a frequency
    divider using regenerative modulation can be used as an
    analogue method for the solution of mathieu and meissner
    differential equations an experimental frequency divider is
    described and a number of waveforms obtained with it are
    reproduced
