a junction transistor scaling circuit with resolution the
    basic circuit discussed is a binary scaler using a
    differentiating transformer instead of capacitors for coupling
    the speed of operation thus depends only on the transistor
    characteristics scale of and scale of circuits built up from
    the basic circuit are described
