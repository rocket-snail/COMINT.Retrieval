school media centres' possibilities and limitations, as
    exemplified by a school in pfullingen. in most school
    libraries, audio-visual media have taken second place to
    printed works, which may explain why school libraries are only
    sporadically used as a base for teaching. demonstrates the
    requirements, possibilities and limitations of the
    incorporation of media centres in the learning processes in a
    school setting, using a school in pfullingen as a case study.
    shows that the media centre is affected strongly by the general
    uncertainty surrounding the use of media in schools.
