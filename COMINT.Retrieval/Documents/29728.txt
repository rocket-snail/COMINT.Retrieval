the diffraction of an arbitrary pulse by a wedge an
    extension of the conical flow method used by keller and blank
    the coordinates chosen are such that the characteristic cone
    and the two planes intersecting to form the wedge each become
    constant coordinate surfaces the problem is then solved by
    separating variables and expanding the boundary conditions in
    terms of solutions of the ordinary differential equations which
    appear the results are shown to apply to the special case
    investigated by keller and blank
