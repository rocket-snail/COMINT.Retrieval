atmospheric radio noise at frequencies between and the
    results are described in terms of a voltage envelope at the
    output of a narrow band receiver between points the rms voltage
    deduced by integrating the measured amplitude distributions
    varies between four and eight times the average voltage the
    noise is always much more impulsive than fluctuation noise the
    structure of the voltage envelope is considered in two ways the
    amplitude distribution of pulse peaks and the amplitude
    distribution of voltage see also of
