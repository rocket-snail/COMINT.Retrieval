a comparison between mobile and stationary libraries in
    rural areas with reference to costs and performance. there is
    still disagreement over whether mobile or stationary libraries
    provide the best service for rural areas with populations under
    5,000. mobile libraries permit flexible organisation and can
    come close to users' homes; they are operated by professional
    staff who bring a large and varied book stock supplemented by
    central reserves. since they are only in 1 place for a short
    time, however, they cannot easily become cultural centres.
    small stationary branch libraries in rural areas have small,
    restricted stocks and are rarely served by professional staff.
    a comparison of initial and running costs for mobile and small
    stationary branch libraries in middle franconia reveals that
    mobile library provision is the cheaper method and a comparison
    of performances, that it is the more efficient.
