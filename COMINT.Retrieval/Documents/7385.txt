the use of biblio-data in classification. the german
    library's national bibliographic data bank is called
    biblio-data (bd). bd consists of a data base; german
    bibliography (deutsche bibliographie) and the ibm full text
    dialogue system, stairs (storage and information retrieval
    system). bd aids the classification department of the german
    library in many ways' it makes research in various locations
    unnecessary and concentrates the entire process of information
    retrieval in one place; it provides a multidimensional
    classification system with access to many general and
    specialised catalogues which were not available in such a
    complete and efficient form before; it provides a means of
    locating material of which only fragments of the title are
    known as it is able to combine unspecific pieces of search
    information very rapidly; also it is no longer necessary to
    deal with an increasing number of monthly or quarterly
    registers as bd acts as a continuous processer updating the
    complete mass of title material.
