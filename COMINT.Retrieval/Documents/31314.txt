horizontal wind systems in the ionospheric e region
    deduced from the dynamo theory of the geomagnetic variation
    wind systems are deduced from sq data for the solstice seasons
    in both northern and southern hemispheres and the diurnal and
    semi diurnal components are examined a comparison of the
    theoretical system with observed winds is made wind velocities
    are calculated taking account of coriolis forces and assuming
    the electron density at night to be that at noon parts
