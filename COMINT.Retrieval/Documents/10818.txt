a turns index for pulse transformer design by assuming
    certain ratios between core and coil dimensions which represent
    average values of normal practical designs it is found possible
    to generalize design relations so that coil and core dimensions
    are eliminated from first design considerations the only
    parameter remaining being that of the turns of the windings for
    a step up pulse transformer of ratio a formula is given for the
    number of turns on the secondary in terms of performance
    requirements and properties of the dielectric and magnetic
    materials used the formula was checked against actual values
    for existing transformers covering a range of pulse widths from
    to and secondary voltages from to
