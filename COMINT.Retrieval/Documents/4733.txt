picture books: what do reviews really review?. to find
    out whether reviews of picture books really review the
    pictures, 50 reviews published in 1979 by each of 4
    widely-respected reviewing sources ((1) 2hornbook1, (2)
    2booklist1, (3) 2school library journal1, and (4) 2bulletin of
    the center for children's books1) were selected at random. a
    count was made of the proportion of words describing the
    illustrations and all factors contributing to the 'look' of a
    picture book. 70% of reviews in (1), 82% in (2), 78% in (3),
    and 94% in (4) devoted 30% or less of their words to visual
    qualities. these results expose an omission in the reviewers'
    responsibilities and a disservice to readers.
