self trapping of an electron by the acoustical mode of
    lattice vibration when the coupling constant between the
    electron and acoustic mode vibration exceeds a critical value
    the effective mass of the electron increases discontinuously
    and the electron takes a localized self trapping state as an
    eigenstate
