differential analyser the npls new analogue computer for
    solving differential equations brief description of a large
    analyser recently brought into use the machine i actuated by a
    motor driven shaft representing the independent variable the
    three principal types of mechanism used are integrators ger
    trains and differential gears function tables permit an
    arbitrary function of any variable to be inserted from the
    graph and also allow solutions to be obtained in graphical form
    setting up time is low since all units are coupled by means of
    servomechanisms which may be connected in any combination
    through a telephone type switchboard
