on the integral width of cascaded tuned amplifiers a
    formula is derived by which the overall integral bandwidth of
    an amplifier containing a number of noninductively coupled
    circuits is expressed in the effective quality factors of the
    separate resonance circuits the quantity can also be expressed
    in the integral widths of the separate circuits for two or
    three stages very simple relations are found
