extension of the possibilities of filter circuit
    construction by means of regions of imaginary characteristic
    impedance in the pass bad and regions of real characteristic
    impedance in the stop band the choice of filters with
    favourable transient characteristics the design of networks
    with the desired characteristics for pulse shaping circuits is
    based on an analogue computer method of examples are given of
    filters with idel idealized response or with transfer function
    approximated by polynomials
