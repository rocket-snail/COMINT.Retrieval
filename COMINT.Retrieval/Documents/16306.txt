the correspondence between ladder filters connected
    between a resistance and zero or infinite impedance and ladder
    filters connected between two resistances the response curve of
    a quadripole defined in terms of image parameters and inserted
    between two finite resistances is determined by separating the
    actual insertion loss into components the analysis is developed
    for the case of one of the resistances becoming infinite or
    zero alternative analysis is given for the quadripole defined
    in terms of its component impedances relations are derived for
    transforming a ladder filter connected between two resistances
    to a network giving the same attenuation frequency
    characteristic when the source impedance is infinite or
    zero
