resistor temperature coefficients tests were carried out
    on four types of pyrolytic cr carbon film resistor and one type
    of metal film resistor several samples of each type of
    different resistance ratings being used the results obtained
    for the temperature range from to are shown graphically the
    temperature coefficients of the carbon film resistors are
    considerably lower than those of carbon composition resistors
    the coefficients are negative and much greater than those of
    wire wound resistors though this is not the case for borocarbon
    film resistors of et al
