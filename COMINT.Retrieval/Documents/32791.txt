some experiments with miniature power triodes description
    including complete circuit diagrams and discussion of
    performance of two af amplifiers with an output of about one of
    which uses valves in push pull and the other four valves in
    parallel in a single ended output using unselected components
    the latter amplifier gave a more satisfactory
    performance
