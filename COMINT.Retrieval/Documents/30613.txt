fundamentals in the synthesis of loss free quadripoles
    from lines with continuous non uniformities the synthesis is
    facilitated by appropriate choice of line coordinates and a
    polynomial representation of the characteristic impendance
    application to problems of wide band transformation and
    matching are illustrated
