the stability of the equilibrium configuration of a
    current carrying wire in a magnetic field the problem is
    considered in relation to the investigation of the trajectories
    of charged particles by the floating wire method as discussed
    by loeb analysis shows that in certain cases when the field has
    focusing properties the configuration of the wire is unstable
    application of the results to a betatron problem is briefly
    indicated
