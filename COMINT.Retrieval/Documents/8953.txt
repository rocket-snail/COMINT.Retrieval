book losses from public libraries' the national library
    experience. the commonest reasons for book losses from public
    libraries are theft, non-return of books, and losses whilst on
    loan to readers. thefts may be prevented by such measures as
    closed access systems, better reader supervision, security
    devices and library user education; non-return may be combatted
    by better membership registration and issue procedures,
    revision of fines, or legal action; and losses by borrowers are
    outside the effective control of the librarian.
