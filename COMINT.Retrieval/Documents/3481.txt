requirements and supply of literature in pharmaceutical
    training. it is impossible to draw a line between the training
    of pharmacists and other natural science training. it is
    questionable what the purpose of training actually is, but it
    is obvious that pharmacists must be trained to practise
    immediately in a pharmacy, at a sick-bed, in a research
    institute or a pharmaceutical factory. those involved in
    training need specialist books and journals. in hungary, these
    can be purchased by everybody, although purchase of foreign
    materials may be financially difficult. library budgets should
    permit the purchase of expensive bibliographies and abstracting
    journals, and reference books, librarians insisting on their
    continuous acquisition. financial problems may be solved by
    budgets which follow proportional price increase, and by
    governments willing to reduce import profit rates of materials
    for education, research and medical treatment. librarians
    should be well acquainted with the terminology, training system
    and literature of their field, and be qualified to introduce
    readers to intellectual work.
