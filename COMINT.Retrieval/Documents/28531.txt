a national lending library for australia. presents a
    model for the future supply of interloans in australia.
    proposes a national loan/photocopy collection at the national
    library of australia (n.l.a.) for current journals, supported
    by a highly selective union list. access to locations for dead
    titles and last runs would be through a less volatile union
    catalogue covering 60-70 libraries. reports would be supplied
    from a single centre for the whole country. likewise, central
    provision for books would be made by the n.l.a., supported by a
    union catalogue covering those libraries with significant
    unique holdings and intake.
