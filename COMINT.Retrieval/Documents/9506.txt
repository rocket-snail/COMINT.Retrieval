legibility aspects of coded online information. on-line
    services provide highly structured material, like bibliographic
    information, but normally no specifications for typographical
    layout. the increasing use of textual data bases makes it
    necessary to include some generalised codes into the text.
    these flags are needed to assist the output device in
    presenting the material in the best possible way according to
    the accepted rules of legibility research. this coding should
    be suitable for different types of display equipment. modern
    legibility research covering typography, layout, colour usage
    and better knowledge of reading is beginning to supply the
    tools which help to make it clear that text is more than
    strings of characters suitable for visual perception in a given
    sequence.
