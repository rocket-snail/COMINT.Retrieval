diode cuts transistor cut off current drift amplified
    thermal variations of cut off current in grounded emitter
    amplifiers can be compensated by compensated by connecting a
    diode experiencing the same thermal changes and having similar
    collector base junction saturation current characteristics
    across the transistor base emitter junction
