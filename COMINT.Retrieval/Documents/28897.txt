geographical distribution of australian library
    resources. extract from recent trends in resource acquisition
    in australian academic and research libraries, a paper
    presented by g.g. allen and j.r. brockman at the 47th ifla
    conference, leipzig, aug 81. tabulates and discusses the
    distribution of library resources by state as a percentage of
    national resources, distribution of population, and library
    books/inhabitant (all 1933-79). resources are far from evenly
    distributed among the major population centres; canberra is
    particularly well served; and victoria (2nd most populous state
    and centre of australia's establishment and business activity)
    is surprisingly badly served.
