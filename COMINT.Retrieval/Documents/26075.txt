correlation function for a system of particles carrying
    like charges a description of a mathematical method for the
    determination of correlation functions for systems of particles
    carrying like charges this method could be extended to charges
    of different sign and also to the kinetic theory of charged
    particles see also of tyablikov and tolmachev
