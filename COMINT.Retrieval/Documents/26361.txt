machine-readable output from online searches.
    machine-readable output (mro) from on-line searches is useful
    in the compilation of large bibliographies. arrangements were
    made with a major on-line retrieval vendor to obtain (for a
    fee) output in the form of magnetic tape, rather than
    conventional off-line prints on paper. a programme was written
    to transform and process the data; part of this programme is
    similar to a computer compiler. a method of checking for
    duplicate items was developed. mro is cost-effective and
    eliminates the time-consuming and labour-intensive data entry
    process. it is a natural extension of the powers of on-line
    retrieval systems.
