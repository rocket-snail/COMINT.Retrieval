on some characteristics of the e layer some aspects of
    the dependence of e ionization on the geomagnetic field are
    discussed an attempt is made to deduce the mean world wide
    drift direction of e in summer by using the time displacement
    that occurs for the daily maxima of the hourly median values of
    e
