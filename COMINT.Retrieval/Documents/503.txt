influence of an alternating voltage and a direct voltage
    on a nonlinear capacitor families of curves are presented
    showing measured variations of capacitance and tan as functions
    of a direct voltage and a voltage applied simultaneously for a
    capacitor with dielectric the curves facilitate determination
    of optimum working point for dielectric amplifiers
