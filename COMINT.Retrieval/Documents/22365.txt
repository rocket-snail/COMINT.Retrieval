free path formulae for the electronic conductivity of a
    weakly ionized gas in the presence of a uniform and constant
    magnetic field and a sinusoidal electric field a general free
    path formula is given for the drift velocity of electrons in a
    weakly ionized gas in a sinusoidal electric field most special
    cases of interest including the magnetic deflection of an
    electron stream in a gas are readily derivable from the general
    formula the results find application in microwave and
    ionospheric studies of the motion of electrons in gases as well
    as in experiments on the magnetic deflection of an electron
    stream see also above
