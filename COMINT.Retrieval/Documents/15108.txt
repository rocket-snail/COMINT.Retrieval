forces between parallel electron streams a simplified
    fundamental analysis is presented taking account of the forces
    of acceleration es repulsion em attraction gravitation and any
    local fields the results indicate that for all electron
    velocities up to the immediate threshold of the velocity of
    light the resultant force between parallel electron streams is
    repulsive
