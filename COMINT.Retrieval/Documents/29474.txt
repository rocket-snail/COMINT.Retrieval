a note on thermodynamics of the harmonic oscillator with
    radiation damping it is shown that the impedance of an
    irreversible thermodynamical system must be positive and real
    the argument is based on representation of the system by
    langevin equations of the second order corresponding to the
    construction of any passive network from elementary rlc
    circuits the conclusion is illustrated by an examination of the
    properties of the harmonic oscillator
