the impedance concept impedances and associated transfer
    functions are expressed in terms of a variable which is closely
    associated with time differentiation the fundamental properties
    of the world are discussed a general condition dor an algebraic
    equation to be free from roots with positive real parts is
    obtained a network whose characteristic equation has this
    property is stable conditions are deduced for a system to have
    a damping rate at least equal to a specified value the effect
    of adding terms in on the roots of a given cubic in is examined
    the effect on the gain and maximum obtainable feedback of the
    addition of a step circuit to a three stage amplifier is
    considered in detail
