latitude variation of day cosmic ray intensity decreases
    the latitude variation of decreases in cosmic ray intensity due
    to the modulation effects of a geocentric nebula of disordered
    magnetic fields has been measured experimental data provided by
    neutron monitor observations during the period of intense solar
    activity show that equatorial variations exceed calculated
    values by a factor of two or more
