infological models and information user views. the design
    of information systems requires information content to be
    defined independently from the handling of information. the
    infological perspective stresses this and is based on a
    semantical model rather than a real-world model. some of the
    basic infological concepts discussed are the informational
    representation of data items, elementary messages and their
    structure, and e-sentences. a large number of concepts and
    terms is required with a qualitative and quantitative
    information data dictionary consistent with the relevant user
    view. the characteristics and formation of concept data objects
    and property references are described, creating a hierarchic
    concept structure. the hermeneutical circle (infological
    meaning in hermeneutical texts) is demonstrated, and the
    infological and datalogical user views are described and
    compared.
