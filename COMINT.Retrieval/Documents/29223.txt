sensitivity of microwave spectrometers using maser
    techniques expressions ar derived for the reduction in the
    coefficient of minimum detectable absorption in a microwave
    waveguide when molecules in an excited state are added along
    the waveguide the application of this principle to a cavity
    spectrometer is discussed
