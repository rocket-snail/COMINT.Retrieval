a study of information channels in technical
    communication' their role in technology transfer and
    technological innovation. summary of a brazilian dissertation
    presented for a higher degree in information science, based
    chiefly on recent literature, brazilian and foreign. the study
    covers the process of communication in science and technology;
    user characteristics; the relationship between technological
    innovation and information channels; and technology transfer
    and information channels. this analysis of the process leads to
    the conclusion that in research and development laboratories,
    informal channels of technical communication are the most
    significant. proposes ways in which research and development
    managers can maximise use of human resources through
    manipulation of the communication channels within the
    organisation, through investigation of the existing
    communication/information roles as information processing
    systems. these roles constitute the true agents of technical
    communication , both within the organisation and between
    separate organisations. particular reference is made to recent
    brazilian research.
