a relation between susceptance slope and selectivity for
    oscillator design two quantities the slope of the susceptance
    curve computed at an antiresonance frequency the dimensionless
    selectivity factor q are significant in specifying the
    performance of oscillatory circuits the relation between the
    two quantities for practical resonant circuits is discussed and
    general conclusions are drawn relating to resonant circuit
    design these conclusions are applied to the comparison of the
    clapp and colpitts types of oscillator and to the study of the
    equivalent circuit of a quartz crystal operating near
    resonance
