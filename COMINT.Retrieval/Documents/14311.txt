analysis of a special purpose rc filter incorporating a
    periodically conducting bilinear element the circuit discussed
    is essentially a low pass filter incorporating a two way switch
    modulated carrier is applied and the switch is operated at
    carrier frequency so that the output is a series of amplitude
    modulated pulses analysis is presented based on consideration
    of the stepwise accumulation of charge by the capacitor and
    taking account of the dead time when the switch is out of
    contact application in the field of automatic control is
    mentioned
