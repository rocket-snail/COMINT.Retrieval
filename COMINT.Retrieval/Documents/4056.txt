libraries: cultural role and the problems of
    librarianship. consists of part of k.i. rubinskii's 1909
    lecture at kharkov university. libraries deserve serious study
    as factors in human culture. they are a country's most valuable
    asset. librarianship should become a university subject as it
    evolves the best methods of disseminating knowledge.
    librarianship needs to study the work of people's and public
    libraries, library history, statistics, book conservation,
    library buildings and staff training. libraries must help all
    those turning to them as a school. however, untrained staff
    will hamper this. the people's wages created libraries, use of
    them is their right.
