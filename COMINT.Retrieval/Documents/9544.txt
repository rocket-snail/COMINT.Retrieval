port moresby public libraries: a snapshot in time.
    describes some of the efforts underway at the port moresby
    public library, ela beach, papua new guinea, and the waigani
    public library in the national library to help librarians to
    know the public they serve. a questionnaire survey of library
    users was carried out by librarians and statistics students at
    the administrative college, port moresby, to determine users'
    nationality, sex, age, education, residence, mode of travel,
    time spent travelling to the library, frequency of library
    visits, reason for visit, and suggestions of material for
    purchase by the library. results are tabulated and analysed,
    with commentary on their implications for improvement of
    services in the 2 libraries.
