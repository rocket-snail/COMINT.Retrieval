a note on moving poles in nonlinear oscillating systems
    since poles of the complex immittance of a linear system
    represent the decrements and frequencies of rotating phasors in
    the linear time domain it is suggested that a nonlinear system
    might be represented by moving poles whose instantaneous
    decrements and frequencies are associated with phasors rotating
    in the nonlinear of time distorted phase space this idea is
    applied to the analysis of a class of nonlinear oscillation
    generators of the second order which is described by the
    differential equation o
