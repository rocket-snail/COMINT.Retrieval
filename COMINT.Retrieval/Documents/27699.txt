insertions and deletions in one-sided height-balanced
    trees recently hirschberg has established that insertions into
    one-sided height-balanced trees can be done in 0(log^2n) steps.
    it is proved here that deletions can also be performed in
    0(log^2n) steps, which answers the open problem posed by
    hirschberg. march, 1978 kosaraju, s.r. avl trees, balanced
