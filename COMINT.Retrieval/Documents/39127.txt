the forming of the negative electrode of electrolytic
    capacitors an examination is made of the conditions under which
    undesired forming occurs formulae are presented for the
    decrease of the capacitance on repeated dis charging these
    enable load behaviour to be predicted and optimum design to be
    attained the theory is supported by experimental results
