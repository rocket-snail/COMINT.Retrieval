two-year college libraries' a comparative analysis in
    terms of acrl 2standards. the analysis of 1977 higher education
    general information surveys (hegis) data for 2-year college
    libraries in terms of the 1979 association of college and
    research libraries (acrl) 2standards 1shows that a majority do
    not meet the standards in respect to nearly all the variables
    available for study. hegis data do not include measures of some
    important factors such as space and equipment, and not all data
    are gathered in terms that match the 2standards' 1definitions.
    increased financial support is needed to bring the libraries of
    the usa's 2-year schools up to standard.
