on the increase in cosmic ray intensity and the
    electromagnetic state in interplanetary space during the solar
    flare of feb a detailed analysis of the onset times of the
    increase in intensity is used in the study of the
    electromagnetic state the existence of deflecting magnetic
    fields between the sun and the earth is demonstrated a probable
    mechanism is discussed whereby flare low energy cosmic ray
    particles could be trapped and guided by a solar beam which
    could also have caused the large magnetic storm observed two
    days after the flare
