bulgarian periodicals as an information source on
    librarianship. one of the special bibliographies published by
    the cyril and methodius national library in sofia covers
    literature on librarianship, bibliography and information
    science. from 1967-76, 4330 headings were listed. more than 90%
    were articles and special papers, and only the remaining 10%
    included books. national dailies as well as regional and local
    papers also paid attention to libraries. they emphasised,
    however, mostly general issues or topics of local interest and
    timing frequency as well as standards varied considerably.
    since 1954, 2bibliotekar1 has been almost the only stable
    periodical for librarians and has so far remained the only
    bulgarian periodical of this kind known and abstracted abroad.
    information scientists have lacked their own special
    periodical. the gap has been partly filled by the effort of the
    central library of the bulgarian academy of sciences.
