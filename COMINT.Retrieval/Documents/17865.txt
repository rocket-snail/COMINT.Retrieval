the behaviour of ferromagnetic particles in a rotating
    magnetic field account of an experimental investigation of the
    motion of ferromagnetic particles of order of magnitude cm
    suspended in gas at pressures between and mm hg and subjected
    to illumination and to a magnetic field rotating at
