the efficacity of indexing systems in relation to
    under-usage of documentation. an edited version of a paper
    presented at a 1980 quebec corporation des bibliothecaires
    professionnels conference. the problem of under-usage is
    generally attributed to obsolescence of documentation and
    solved by weeding. the phenomenon is more complex and the
    entropy of a documentation system is also a result of
    inadequacies in indexing, selection services, and user
    training. the reasons for deciding that material is out of date
    and clogging the information system are examined in detail, to
    show how more efficient documentation management can increase
    usage.
