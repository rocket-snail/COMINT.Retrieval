video-a revolution for the deaf. contribution to an issue
    devoted to library services for the disabled. video technology
    has meant something of a revolution to those born deaf, since
    their own, sign, language can now be preserved on video films,
    and thus, in a sense, 'put into print'. describes work carried
    out at the county library in vasteras, sponsored by the
    national cultural council, sweden, to produce video films for
    the deaf. projects so far include recordings of ibsen's 'a
    doll's house', books, and cinderella. some time in the future,
    when vcrs have become standard technical aids for the deaf, it
    should be as natural for the libraries to lend videograms to
    the deaf as it is for them to lend talking books to the
    blind.
