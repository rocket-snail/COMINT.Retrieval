world wide characteristics of geomagnetic micropulsations
    the characteristics of associated with negative or positive
    bays in the auroral zone are examined and a distinction is
    drawn between short period and those of longer periods the long
    period continuous pulsations which appear simultaneously with
    in polar regions are also discussed equivalent overhead current
    systems are derived for particular cases of each type
