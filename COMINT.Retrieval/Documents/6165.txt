meteor echo duration and radio wavelength the durations
    of radar echoes from meteors have been observed simultaneously
    on and and also on and m the ratio of durations on two
    wavelengths decreases with increasing duration by a factor of
    two over the observed range deviating significantly from the
    accepted square law of wavelengths plotting the log of the
    ratio against the log of the duration yields two straight lines
    of different slopes one in the short duration range and the
    other applying to the longer echoes general empirical formulae
    are developed to predict the echo duration on one radio
    equipment in terms of the duration of the same echo recorded by
    another apparatus of different sensitivity and
