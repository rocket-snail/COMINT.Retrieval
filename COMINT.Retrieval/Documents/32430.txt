public libraries in the information age. since the
    mid-60s computers have been used in public libraries to fulfil
    2 main functions; housekeeping routines and information
    retrieval. the advent of on-line information retrieval systems
    and the development of cooperative cataloguing services at the
    beginning of the 70s, and videotex systems available towards
    the end of the 70s have provided both an opportunity and a
    challenge to public library authorities.
