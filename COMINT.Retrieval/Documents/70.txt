an analogue computing circuit for the evaluation of the
    ratio of two slowly varying potentials the circuit based on the
    miller integrator is described in detail the computed ratio is
    displayed as a meter deflection the use of feedback reduces the
    sensitivity to valve characteristic variations the error is
    less than of full scale deflection within wide input limits
    computation of reciprocals and products may be performed by
    means of similar circuits several possible applications of the
    device are mentioned
