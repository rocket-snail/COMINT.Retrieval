reflection of an electron beam from high frequency fields
    experimental verification of time average forces due to an rf
    field acting on charged particles is obtained by measuring the
    transmission of an electron beam through the high frequency
    fields of a cavity by adjusting the external dc magnetic field
    so that cyclotron resonance is approached it is possible to
    reflect high energy beams that is of microwave power completely
    reflected a beam agreement between experiment and theory was
    close
