experimental investigations on electron interaction
    certain observations in low pressure gas discharges and in
    magnetrons suggest an electron interaction effect several
    orders of magnitude in excess of the theoretical values based
    on binary encounters only the validity of the theory was tested
    by experiments in which a carefully colimated electron beam was
    shot through a charge cloud the scattering of the beam being
    directly observed both plasmas in thermal equilibrium and pure
    electronic space charges were investigated in both cases the
    degree of scattering observed is less than five times the value
    predicted by theories neglecting simultaneous multiple
    collisions hence the latter cannot account for the observed
    anomalies
