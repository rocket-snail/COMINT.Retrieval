transients in nonlinear servomechanisms with filters
    continuing previous work of equations are derived for amplitude
    and elongation a complex function of time for the case of small
    damping and a new construction o for point to point tracing of
    the xt curve is indicated which furnishes a new criterion of
    stability of steady states of oscillation
