extemplo-reflections on a year. the electronic journal
    via scannet, extemplo, completed its 2nd year in 1980. it draws
    together notes on lectures, courses and conferences on
    scientific information within the nordic countries. its
    decentralised editing, by local editors in the nordic
    countries, may be a precursor to the author/editor/reviewer
    communication in future scientific electronic journals.
    extemplo is entered via a fairly simple editing procedure into
    the dec10 computer at gothenburg's medicindata. its future
    development will be greatly influenced by the ongoing changes
    in the long distance telecommunication network available in the
    nordic countries.
