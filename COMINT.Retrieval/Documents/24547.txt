derivative controlled magnet amplifiers a two stage
    circuit for a low level fast response unit is described the
    first stage acts as derivative amplifier amplifying average
    increments of signal voltage per half cycle of power supply
    voltage the second stage acts as integrator amplifying and
    summing the output voltage of the first stage if the negative
    feedback applied to the first stage is delayed by a low pass
    filter the total time constant of a system incorporating the
    amplifier can be effectively reduced
