biochemistry and molecular biology journal prices. a
    study of biochemistry and molecular biology journal prices for
    1967-79 is presented. results show that these journals are
    comparable in cost to physics and chemistry journals,
    previously found most costly. when weighted averages are
    compared, these journals are the most expensive for which price
    data are available in the usa. a small number of highly cited
    journals account for nearly 50% of the cost of the entire list
    of 83 journals studied-a fact which has serious implications
    for the management of journal collections. the need for
    government subsidies to academic libraries for the purchase of
    scientific journals is reiterated.
