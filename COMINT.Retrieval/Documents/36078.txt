aacr2 and their effect upon israeli libraries (in
    hebrew). a brief discussion of aacr2 opens the article. the
    rules are the result of a desire for true international
    uniformity, though they are still 'anglo-american' in their
    preference of english forms. aacr2 gives equal status to book
    and non-book materials. there is much less stress on
    'authorship' and more on 'responsibility'. the uniform
    structure of all chapters is described. describes important
    changes-as compared to aacr1-in rules for descriptive
    cataloguing and headings. some reservations are made about
    headings for jewish religious works. the decision by lc to
    carry out 'desuperimposition' and to close its catalogue is
    noted, and its effect on us libraries discussed. israeli
    cataloguing has traditionally followed us practice, and israeli
    libraries will adopt aacr2 sooner or later to avail themselves
    of foreign cataloguing and to enable israeli cataloguing to
    become part of the international network of bibliographic
    control. y et, it is not imperative to adopt aacr2 immediately.
    it is desirable to wait and see how us libraries accustom
    themselves to the changes and to see how lc implements and
    interprets the rules. meanwhile it is suggested that all
    options in aacr2 be checked, and a uniform israeli practice be
    adopted. it is also desirable that the feasibility of adopting
    aacr2 at the highest level of description by 2kiryath sepher1,
    the israel national bibliography, be checked.
