a new storage element suitable for large sized memory
    arrays the twistor use is made of the wiedemann effect whereby
    a torsion applied to a magnetic wire shifts the preferred
    direction of magnetization into a helical path there three
    modes are suggested in using the effect for storage cells the
    coincidence of circular and longitudinal magnetic fields
    inserts information into the wire as a polarized helical
    magnetization operation similar to the coincident current
    toroid with the wire acting as its own sensing winding the wire
    is not twisted but the screw sense of the flux path is related
    to the current polarities equations relating to the switching
    performance of a twistor are derived and a description of an
    experimental bit array is given
