hierarchical architecture for computer mail systems. an
    architectural model for large, distributed computer mail
    systems is presented. this model specifies' a minimum set of
    functional components that supports all computer mail
    functions; the functions and structure of each component; the
    communication protocol needed for interprocess communication;
    and the organisation of the identification data base used to
    support identification services in the architecture. the
    computer mail protocol of the architecture is specified
    following the framework of the reference model for open system
    architectures proposed by the iso, and each layer of the
    protocol is discussed in detail. the organisation of the
    identification data base is based on the same layering concept,
    and special emphasis is given to the role of identification
    services in large systems and the interconnection of various
    systems.
