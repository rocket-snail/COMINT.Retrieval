the new central library in kiel-a lucky chance. a
    convenient central site was found for the new library at kiel,
    whose stocks total 100,000 items. the building was designed for
    flexibility; covering a total area of 4,600 sq.m., it sets a
    standard for towns of this size. the ground floor area, for
    issue counter, cloakroom and newspapers, is rather small but
    the upper storeys are generously proportioned. the 1st floor
    houses the children's library, fiction and a meeting-room
    seating 100 people; a small audio centre is planned here but
    ultimately kiel will probably have a separate music library and
    audio centre elsewhere. the 2nd floor contains non-fiction,
    periodicals, newspaper cuttings, pamphlets, catalogues and
    information services. administrative departments are on the 3rd
    and 4th floors and there is also a small cellar stack.
