on some problems of subject cataloguing at the wismar
    college of engineering library. the wismar college of
    engineering library uses a classified catalogue for subject
    cataloguing which was introduced in 1970. it is based on the
    hierarchic universal classification system of the rostock
    university library. this is suitable for the stock of the
    wismar library which covers a very wide range of subjects. the
    systematic catalogue has a flexible notation system which can
    cover complex terms extending to 6 columns and also has
    keywords' general, geographical, chronological, linguistic and
    literature. the systematics work at the wismar library has
    several objectives' to adapt the rostock university library's
    universal classification to the specialised wismar collection;
    to overcome the problems arising from scientific developments
    by expanding and bringing up to date the schedules; and to work
    out new systems in cases where the limits of existing ones are
    reached. where this has been necessary 2 c atalogues have
    sometimes been in existence simultaneously to avoid loss of
    information for the user.
