who's afraid of the rebellious youngsters of today?: or,
    librarians were also young once. in recent years there has been
    a steady increase in the number of cases of hooliganism in
    libraries caused by young people in the netherlands. a number
    of conferences have been held on the subject and in several
    areas working parties have been formed to study the problem.
    throughout the netherlands the number of registered library
    users below the age of 18 has increased by 93% following the
    abolition of membership charges for young people. librarians
    should recognise that young people represent the next
    generation of adult readers and should take steps to encourage
    them to make use of libraries by providing special rooms where
    young people may listen to music and meet their friends.
