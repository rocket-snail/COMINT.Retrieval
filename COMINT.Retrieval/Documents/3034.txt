hf wide band electronic integrator design compensation
    for distortion of the integrated waveform due to valve output
    capacitances can be introduced by the addition of a capacitor
    in parallel with the integrating network resistance an
    exprression is derived for calculating the capacitance for the
    basic rc integrator and the miller integrator
