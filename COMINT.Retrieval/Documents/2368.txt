electromechanical filters for carrier and sideband
    selection torsional type filters comprises cylindrical
    resonators with coupling necks are discussed descriptions are
    given of two filters with bandwidths of respectively using a
    particular alloy known as the temperature variation of
    frequency is parts per millions magnetostrictive transducers
    made of this alloy or of ferrite are used spurious modes of
    vibration are reduced by a balanced arrangement of the
    transducers and by mechanical damping in the end
    supports
