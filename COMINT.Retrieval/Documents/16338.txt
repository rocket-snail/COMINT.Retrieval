standards for public library services' reactions to a
    report (part) 2. part 1 of this article appeared in bibliotheek
    en samenleving 9 (2) feb 81, 46-51 (see 81/5155). the
    guidelines for standards of public library service published in
    1980 in the netherlands by the committee for the coordination
    of standards in public library service contain no discussion of
    the background to the suggested standards. some sections of the
    report contain considerably greater detail than others, which
    gives the report an unbalanced appearance. it is also
    noteworthy that no standards for staffing are included. in
    comparison with the ifla standards of service and those in
    other countries the standards here proposed are somewhat low.
    only experience in practical use can show whether they are
    adequate.
