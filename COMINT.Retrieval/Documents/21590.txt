serials education in master's degree programs in
    accredited library schools in the united states and canada.
    (phd thesis-florida state university.) a questionnaire survey
    was sent to the directors of the 68 us and canadian accredited
    library schools, concerning courses on serials acquisition,
    collection development, control, cataloguing, and
    classification. 9 telephone interviews were held with the
    teachers of such courses to identify their characteristics and
    objectives. the 56 questionnaire responses showed that less
    attention was paid to serials control than to other
    serials-related topics and that there were significant
    differences in teaching of concepts in separate and
    non-separate serials courses.
