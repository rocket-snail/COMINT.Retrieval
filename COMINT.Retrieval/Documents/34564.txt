the microwriter. currently the microwriter is the
    foundation for a new way of writing in almost any environment,
    with only 1 hand, and with the capacity and capability of being
    able to store, retrieve, edit, format and transmit written
    information either as the printed word, or in convertible
    machine language. separated from the microwriter, the 5 finger
    keyboard could be fitted to conventional equipment, such as
    typewriters, word processing units, telex and computers, giving
    access to numerous people who have the authority and need to
    communicate directly with the equipment, but are unable to
    master the operation of the qwerty keyboard efficiently! in
    these cases the microwriter keyboard will be a peripheral in
    addition to the normal keyboard, and the characteristics of the
    equipment will operate in the normal way.
