publications, documentation and means for their
    dissemination in the commission of the european communities.
    based on discussions conducted with officials from the
    commission of the european communities during a study visit to
    brussels, nov 79. uk membership of the european communities has
    added a new dimension to the national legislative process and
    has generated a fresh body of legislative and associated
    documentation. it has also provided librarians with a new
    series of challenges. the study visit was conceived as a
    fact-finding exercise to gather basic information about the
    internal structure of the community's publishing programme and
    documentation system. consequently, the report contains
    separate chapters on community publications policy, on the
    nature and characteristics of commission documents (as distinct
    from publications) and on the range of automated
    information-retrieval services offered to members of staff
    within the commission. also contains a chapter on european
    documentat ion centres and depository libraries.
