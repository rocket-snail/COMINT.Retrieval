libraries and the organization of universities in france,
    1789-1881. examines the ways in which the interests of
    promoting libraries and the promotion of higher education
    converged in the development of french university libraries in
    the 19th century. the revolution of 1789 abolished universities
    and confiscated their libraries. the imperial university, an
    educational bureaucracy that survived the empire and endured
    for most of the 19th century, did not promote research or
    require research libraries. however, in 1855 efforts began to
    replace the imperial system with autonomous universities, and
    these efforts focused on the role of university libraries. in
    1881 university libraries were created in the provinces as a
    1st step toward creating universities, 15 years before the de
    jure establishment of universities.
