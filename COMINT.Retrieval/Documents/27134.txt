karlsruhe' culture in the palace. in may 81 the former
    palace of the grand dukes of baden was opened to the public as
    a cultural centre. the work of adapting the 19th century
    building for this purpose began in 1978. on the ground floor is
    the library for children and young people, containing 30,000
    volumes which were moved here when premises in the municipal
    library became too small. the 1st floor houses the municipal
    art gallery, specialising in german paintings from 1850 onwards
    and the 2nd floor the local history collection. there are also
    rooms for meetings, film shows and painting sessions, offices,
    a cafeteria and a media centre containing over 3,000 cassettes
    and records. since its opening the centre has achieved
    increases in loans, readers and visitors to the art
    gallery.
