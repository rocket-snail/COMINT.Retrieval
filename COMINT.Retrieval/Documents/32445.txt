charge carrier device as a high ohmic resistance the
    principle of the two arrangements described is the movement of
    a conductor a metal ball of capacitance to and fro at a
    specified frequency in an es field between two electrodes the
    effective resistance r of the circuit is c in the first
    arrangement the ball is fitted to the periphery of an insulated
    disk driven by a synchronous motor in the second the ball is
    free and its movement is controlled by an electromagnet details
    are given of the performance of the system operating in an
    electrometer circuit with balls of different materials with a
    ball in diameter frequency cycles minute and electrode spacing
    mm
