ultra low frequency three phase oscillator an oscillator
    for the frequency range uses three identical networks each
    comprising a polystyrene capacitor and a stable resistor in a
    stair arrangement radiating from the power supply the circuit
    is in effect a three stage amplifier oscillations occurring at
    the frequency for which the phase shift is in each rc network
    uses is made of the miller effect to keep down the size and
    cost of the frequency determining elements
