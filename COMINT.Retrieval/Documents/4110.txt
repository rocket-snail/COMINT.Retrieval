relations between temperature and the phenomena of
    photochemical dissociation or ionization in the upper
    atmosphere particularly in the e layer a calculation of the
    initial kinetic energy of oxygen atoms produced by
    photodissociation of oxygen molecules gives a value
    corresponding to a temperature at altitudes between and
