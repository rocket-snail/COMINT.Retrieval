correlation of magnetic m storms with the monochromatic
    corona results obtained at wendelstein show that a maximum of
    geomagnetic activity is observed days before the central
    meridian passage of a region of g high coronal activity or days
    after the appearance of bright coronal emission at the east
    solar limb similar characteristics are found for the minimum
    epochs the relation apparently holds good only when no visible
    or significant sunspot phenomena exist
