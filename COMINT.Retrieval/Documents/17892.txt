reflex klystron performance from a series of measurements
    made while varying the anode and reflector voltages
    simultaneously constant frequency and constant power curves can
    be constructed typical curves for three modes of operation t
    are shown with the aid of these curves extremely pure amplitude
    or frequency modulation can be achieved by varying and
    simultaneously so that the ratio of their variations is
    constant the change from am to fm may be effected simply by
    altering the ratio the maximum frequency shift with am was
    about with fm a frequency swing of was obtained with constant
    power output of an important application of the systems
    described is the modulation of signal generators for
    measurement purposes
