on-line, new aid in reference work. reports on an
    international conference on on-line information in public
    libraries organised by the british library research and
    development department and held in sept. 81. a number of
    british public libraries have during the last 3 years carried
    out experiments with the use of on-line systems. results of
    these have been published in the british library's report
    series and were discussed at the conference. the question of
    payment for on-line searches was debated. the experience in
    other countries was outlined, including the one from gentofte,
    denmark. in luton central library, england, which formerly
    subscribed to only a few conventional bibliographic services,
    installation of on-line facilities has led to a large
    expansion. new users have been attracted, the library's image
    improved, and the ensuing good-will has been a useful tool in
    the fight against cuts. the staff have become more cost
    conscious and hence more careful in dealing with users, who
    have been more thoroughly interviewed. more time is now spent
    preparing the search strategy. the danger of redundancies as a
    result of greater efficiency was therefore dismissed.
