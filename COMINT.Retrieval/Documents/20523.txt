acquisitions budget control in a cae library. outlines
    the history of acquisitions budget control at the western
    australian institute of technology library (known as the t.l.
    robertson library). during the 1970s, the acquisitions budget
    was adequate; this is now questionable. discusses the budget
    control options available to the library and suggests a
    flexible approach to subject budgets, a portion of the
    monograph budget being earmarked for special needs and the
    remaining larger share being apportioned to the subject
    areas.
