wide band amplifiers for bandwidths up to an account is
    given of amplifiers of the type using low pass filters as
    interstage couplings these are superior to distributed
    amplifiers up to a certain frequency the value of which is
    about when valves are used and with valves a practical limit
    for the number of reactances in the coupling circuit is about
    five further increase would call for too narrow tolerances on
    the components and would greatly increase alignment
    difficulties theoretical computations of the coupling circuit
    could not be made accurately because of frequency variation of
    the components a high accuracy frequency sweep generator is
    essential for the experimental investigations
