nonlinear theory of space charge wave in moving
    interacting electron beams with application to solar radio
    noise consideration of the exact equations for interaction
    between two neutralized electron beams indicates that steady
    state space charge waves can be propagated in such a medium the
    period of the wave depends on the amplitude and phase velocity
    the oscillation is simple harmonic for small amplitudes but
    deviates progressively from this condition as the amplitude
    increases beyond a critical amplitude whose value depends on
    the phase velocity the oscillation waveform becomes
    discontinuous the theory is used to estimate the relative
    intensity of the second harmonic component in solar rf
    outbursts reported by wild et al analysis based on theory of
    radiation from oscillating plasma leads to a value for the rf
    flux of the order of magnitude of that observed
