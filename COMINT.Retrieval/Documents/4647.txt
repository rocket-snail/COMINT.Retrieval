some waveforms of atmospherics and their use in the
    location of thunderstorms the main types of atmospherics
    waveforms recorded in southern england are illustrated and
    their use in estimating range is discussed in an analysis of
    recordings made during one year of the waveforms recorded by
    day and of those by night were suitable for this purpose most
    night time storms within a distance of produce some waveforms
    from which range may be determined with an accuracy within by
    day the corresponding distance is in summer and in
    winter
