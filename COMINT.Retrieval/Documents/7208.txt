test of the equifrequent character string text search
    technique. report describes the design and implementation of
    software, based on the variety generation method, for a search
    system to match retrieval profiles against document texts in
    the inspec database, and the evaluation of the system relative
    to that used by inspec for its sdi service in terms of computer
    resources and costs. the evaluation favours the
    variety-generation method. using inspec's charging algorithm,
    its costs are approximately 75% of those of the operational
    system, while the central processor time is reduced to
    1/2.
