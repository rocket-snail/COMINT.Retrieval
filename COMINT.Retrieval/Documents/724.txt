diffraction by a wide slit and complementary strip the
    diffraction of e and h polarized waves by an infinite slit is
    considered induced current densities aperture and far fields
    and the transmission coefficient are calculated in the form of
    infinite series in inverse powers of the slit width wavelength
    ratio the solution for diffraction by a strip is also obtained
    a comparison is made with previous results this method appears
    to provide accurate information when the slit width is greater
    than a wavelength
