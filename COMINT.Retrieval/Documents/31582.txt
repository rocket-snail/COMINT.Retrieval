the effect of certain solar radiations on the lower
    ionosphere an electron density distribution in the d and e
    regions of the ionosphere is computed lyman alpha lyman beta
    the lyman continuum and x radiations are considered the
    resulting electron distribution is used to compute parameters
    which may then be compared with data from rocket and longwave
    radio experiments in general there is good agreement between
    experimental results and the values predicted by the
    model
