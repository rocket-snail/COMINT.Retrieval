studies for a british register of current research in the
    sciences and technology. reports the results of 3 years study
    at southampton university. the attitudes of university research
    workers, government organisations, learned societies,
    charities, commerce and industry were studied by interview,
    structured seminars and postal questionnaires. concludes that
    all university research workers and many members of all the
    other classes of organisation studied need to maintain an
    up-to-date knowledge of research work in progress and this is
    true of all disciplines. a majority of the needs expressed
    would be met by the publication of a successor to the british
    library publication 2scientific research in british
    universities and colleges1 with as wide a base as possible of
    research organisations, with minor editorial changes and a
    major improvement in publishing time-lag.
