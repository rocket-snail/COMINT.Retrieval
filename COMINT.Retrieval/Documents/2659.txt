harmonic cancellation from computing voltage source in
    servo analogue computers analysis showing how harmonics of the
    carrier can be cancelled out in the summing network of the
    servo amplifier by injecting appropriate harmonic signals into
    the quadrature rejection circuit the analysis is valid for very
    small phase shift the system is advantageous when harmonics
    cannot be sufficiently attenuated by filters
