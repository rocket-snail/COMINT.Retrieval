book thefts from university libraries as a legal problem.
    the theft of books from large, open-plan university libraries
    is a many-sided problem. it has reached such proportions that
    it is costing universities in west germany tens of thousands of
    dm every year and special detector systems have been installed
    in some libraries. these have led to many would-be thefts being
    prevented and charges being brought for theft. however, the
    majority of these charges have had to be dropped owing to
    loopholes in laws applicable to book thefts. german criminal
    law stipulates that the intention of keeping an object must be
    present to constitute a theft; this is usually impossible to
    prove in the case of book thefts. university administrative law
    also fails to provide adequate penalties and varies from one
    state to the next. it is necessary to define the theft of books
    as an offence in administrative law, punishable by a fine
    throughout west germany.
