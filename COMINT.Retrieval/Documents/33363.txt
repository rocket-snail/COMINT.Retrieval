observations of ionospheric absorption at the theory of
    ionospheric absorption is outlined and measurement difficulties
    due to fading are discussed the procedure at the netherlands
    station is to determine the apparent reflection coefficient for
    vertically incident waves using pulse transmissions with
    display of the echo amplitude total absorption and absorption
    index are hence derived the equipment is described and some
    results are reported
