national rankings as a means of evaluating medical school
    library programs' a comparative study. presents the results of
    a comparative study undertaken to assess the reasons for the
    low rankings received by the george washington university
    medical center library in the publication 2annual statistics
    for medical school libraries in the united states and canada1.
    concludes that the 2annual statistics1 and other traditional
    measures of quality are inappropriate and inaccurate measures
    for evaluating library programmes, since they only measure
    resource allocations and not the effectiveness of these
    allocations. suggests some alternative evaluation
    methods.
