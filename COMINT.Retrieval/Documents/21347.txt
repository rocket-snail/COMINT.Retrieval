publishing in the african language' problems and
    prospects. considers reasons why many books published in the
    indigenous african languages are not commercially successful.
    discusses briefly the findings of a survey conducted amongst
    the main publishers of material in the african languages, and
    concludes that only books which are prescribed reading for
    examinations sell in large numbers. notes with regret that
    there is not a single centre or library in africa that is
    systematically collecting creative writing in the african
    languages. attitudes to books and reading in africa are seen as
    being governed by many social and cultural factors, and as
    being also heavily affected by the lack of a sufficient number
    of retail outlets or libraries. argues that, whilst the african
    book professions have a major role to play, the initiative for
    significant change must largely come from government backed
    programmes, and initiatives by local authorities with the aid
    of the media.
