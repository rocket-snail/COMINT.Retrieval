intelligent viewdata terminals for business applications.
    an advanced type of viewdata terminal is described which has
    applications in an electronic office system. the terminal
    supplements the usual viewdata terminal features of colour
    display, graphics capability and telephone network
    communication, by significantly enhanced memory storage and
    processing facilities, and is referred to as an intelligent
    terminal. a specific feature of the intelligent terminal is its
    ability to run programmes which are stored on a central
    computer. hardware, software and user characteristics which
    distinguish the terminal are described and compared with those
    of existing viewdata terminals. several applications of an
    intelligent viewdata terminal in the electronic office are
    presented.
