nonsaturating pulse circuits using two junction
    transistors junction transistors are found to be fast enough
    for pulse applications if the collector voltage is prevented
    from reaching zero switching times can be achieved with
    available types the required limiting action is effected by
    introducing diodes which terminate the switching transients by
    their breakdown a two transistor binary counter is
    described
