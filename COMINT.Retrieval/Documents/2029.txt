stable oscillation conditions for the magnetic film
    parametron a mathematical analysis of a parametron is given
    this parametron uses a single domain magnetic film as the core
    of a nonlinear nductor absorbing energy from an alternating
    pump field and delivering energy to a signal winding graphical
    means of determining stability conditions amplitudes and phases
    of the oscillating variables and the range of operating
    frequencies are discussed
