wris' a resource information system for wildland
    management. wris (wildland resource information system) is a
    computer system for processing, storing, retrieving, updating,
    and displaying geographic data. the polygon, representing a
    land area boundary, forms the building block of wris. polygons
    form a map. maps are digitised manually or by automatic
    scanning. computer programmes can extract and produce polygon
    maps and can overlay, plot, and store them, as well as
    aggregate acreages and print summaries. wris is functionally
    oriented toward timber management, but can be used for other
    types of resource activities.
