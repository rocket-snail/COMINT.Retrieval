statistical indices systems as a basis for evaluation of
    the work of scientific and technical information centres. 2
    systems of statistical indices for evaluation of information
    work are presented: system of primary indices for quantitative
    evaluation of individual information tasks; and system of
    'relative' indices which express the relationship between
    individual parameters and which can be used to evaluate the
    effectiveness of information services and to determine the
    amount of work undertaken by information workers; the system
    can be used to carry out comparative analyses of the activities
    of information centres. using these 2 systems, a complex method
    for evaluation of the work of branch information centres was
    developed. the method employs an algorithm designed by the
    computing centre of the siberian branch of the ussr academy of
    sciences. the method was used to evaluate the work of 33 branch
    information centres; results of the evaluation are
    presented.
