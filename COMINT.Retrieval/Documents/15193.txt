a tentative model of the equilibrium height distribution
    of nitric oxide in the high atmosphere and the resulting d
    layer two possible processes for the production of no are
    considered three body recombination with o and
    photodissociation of into n and no the distribution of known
    constituents of the atmosphere in the range is discussed and
    the no height distribution derived for the two possible
    production processes d layer ionization characteristics are
    satisfactorily explained assuming photoionization of no at and
    the electron distribution is derived both for the case of photo
    chemical equilibrium of no and for a nonequilibrium
    distribution under the conditions of complete mixing
