propagation of acoustic and electromagnetic waves in a
    half space a half space is considered in which the impedance at
    the boundary is given in the form of an arbitrary complex
    number and a general solution of the wave equation is
    formulated by introducing a function which reverts to zero at
    the boundary expressions for the acoustic and e m potential are
    derived in terms of this function
