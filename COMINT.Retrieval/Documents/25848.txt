on a multiple scattering theory of the finite grating and
    the wood anomalies the problem is treated by applying the
    solution previously obtained of for multiple scattering from an
    arbitrary configuration of parallel cylinders both the
    transmission grating and the reflection grating comprising semi
    cylindrical bosses on a perfectly conducting plane are
    considered the complete expression for the scattered wave is
    given for the case of grating width small compared with
    distance to observation point and cylinder spacing large
    compared with the case of raddi is investigated in detail
    bright and dark bands in the intensity curves similar to the
    grating anomalies found by wood in are related to the
    magnitudes and phases of the various orders of scattering the
    theory is extended to gratings with elements other than
    cylinders
