the role of technical and scientific information in the
    training of users. in czechoslovakia in 1952 a decree was
    passed on the extension training of physicians and pharmacists.
    it is the task of the bratislava institute of extension
    training for physicians and pharmacists to supply literature
    and information for this extension training. this means the
    information supply of more than 53 learning groups; about 2,500
    physicians and pharmacists a year. literature is available for
    in-library reading, a large number of documents are lent
    (30,000 units a year). it is, however, considered more
    important to teach the participants of extension training how
    to use the literature and information tools themselves
    (including abstracting journals, indexes and magnetic
    tapes).
