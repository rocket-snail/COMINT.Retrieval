diversifying fiscal support by pricing public library
    services' a policy impact analysis. addresses the possibility
    of diversifying the resource base of us local public library
    systems which currently are critically dependent on property
    taxes for their funding. offers a case for pricing library
    services, and an empirical analysis of such a policy which was
    adopted by the dallas public library system is reported.
    employing a deliberate sequence of significance tests within
    the context of an interrupted time-series, quasi-experimental
    design to study the impact of the programme on service demand,
    the results are evaluated with respect to several economic and
    evaluative performance critera. while such a user-charge policy
    may not be wholly adequate or efficient, it is effective,
    promotes equity, and is deemed appropriate to supplement
    current funding arrangements.
