the effect of the equatorial electro jet on the
    ionospheric e and f layers the occurrence of low values of at
    ibadan is correlated with variations in the horizontal and
    vertical components of the earths field and with f layer
    parameters an immediate relation is indicated between the
    electrojet the production of equatorial e and vertical drifts
    in the f layer
