the turnover phenomenon in thermistors and in point
    contacts germanium rectifiers the turnover power in thermistors
    increases as the square of the absolute ambient temperature the
    similarity i form between the reverse characteristic of a
    teristic of a thermistor a thermal hypothesis for rectifier
    turnover but in the latter case the turnover power decreases
    approximately linearly with ambient temperature the type of
    function necessary to reproduce the rectifier characteristics
    at turnover is discussed such a function cannot be derived from
    existing theories of rectification
