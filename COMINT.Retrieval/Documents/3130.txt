magnetic fields in plasmas with turbulent motion when a
    plasma comprising electrons and ions is in turbulent motion
    diffusion currents give rise to magnetic fields these can be
    demonstrated by rotating the gases produced by burning a
    mixture of oxygen and propane an account is given of suitable
    experimental technique
