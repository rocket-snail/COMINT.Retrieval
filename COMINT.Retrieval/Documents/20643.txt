the design of tetrode transistor amplifiers methods are
    discussed for determining suitable loads when the two port
    parameters of the transistor are known charts are presented ofr
    determining power gain and input impedance as functions of load
    circuits described as examples include a common base amplifier
    a common emitter video amplifier and amplifiers centred at and
    respectively predicted and measured gains are compared
