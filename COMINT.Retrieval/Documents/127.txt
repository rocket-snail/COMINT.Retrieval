design of series peaking transformers essential features
    of this type of transformer are the load current is arranged to
    be negligible compared with the magnetizing current and the
    magnetizing current is allowed to reach a value much greater
    than that required to saturate the core an easy and accurate
    design method is presented which does not require an analytical
    representation of the by bh characteristic the example of a
    transformer to produce a voltage pulse of about for triggering
    a thyratron is worked out numerically the voltage and duration
    of the pulse can be predicted to within about of the measured
    values
