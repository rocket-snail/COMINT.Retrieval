frequency stabilization of a reflex klystron oscillator
    part of the klystron output is fed to a cylindrical resonator
    one of whose ends is constituted by a diaphragm which is
    vibrated at about kcs the detected output from the resonator
    which varies with shift of the klystron frequency is fed to a
    lock in amplifier to produce a control voltage which is added
    to the klystron reflector voltage
