a frequency eliminating transconductance bridge
    description of a bridge circuit which completely eliminates a
    single frequency component n and also partially suppresses a
    band of frequencies whose width can be varied within wide
    limits by suitable choice of circuit parameters applications to
    ripple elimination n and to band elimination amplifiers are
    discussed
