the frequency dependence of transistor quadripole
    parameters the grounded base connection only is considered
    oertels equivalent valve circuit above is a satisfactory
    approximation up to a frequency about half that of cut off but
    a proper description of rf performance requires the addition of
    a base resistance and leakage conductance to the basic
    equivalent circuit measurements on a type oc transistor show
    satisfactory agreement with theory
