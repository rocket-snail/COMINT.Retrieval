symmetrical quadripoles operated as asymmetrical
    transformers a theoretical investigation is presented of the
    behaviour of passive linear quadripoles in asymmetrical
    operation the analysis is based on introduction of the
    characteristic iterative impedance multisection band pass
    filters with different output and input impedances are built up
    with sections which have similar frequency characteristics and
    phase constants but geometrically graduated impedances a
    numerical example is given of a transformation for the
    frequency band
