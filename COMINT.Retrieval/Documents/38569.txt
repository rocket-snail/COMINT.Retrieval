effect of radiation from solar flares on the ionosphere
    and the earths magnetic field variation in the earths magnetic
    field and the corresponding variations in the ionic density of
    the layer due to solar flares are recorded the value of the
    intensity of ultraviolet radiation before it enters the
    atmosphere is obtained the constant relating the ionic density
    and the accompanying magnetic variation is also
    estimated
