oscillator feedback networks of minimum attenuation
    single valve oscillators with feedback networks comprising
    three resistors and three capacitors are discussed optimum
    values for the components are determined by analysis and are
    plotted as functions of valve output resistance for a given
    value of valve input resistance both shunt r and shunt c
    networks are considered the former being recommended for very
    low frequencies and the latter for relatively high ones
