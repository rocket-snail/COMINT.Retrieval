discoidal vs tubular feed through capacitors tubular and
    disk type ceramic feed through capacitors for filtering
    purposes are compared in respect of their coupling impedance
    and its frequency dependence the disk type is superior as
    regards hf performance and mechanical ruggedness the necessary
    improved shielding methods are described
