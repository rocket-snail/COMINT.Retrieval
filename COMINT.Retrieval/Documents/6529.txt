an approximate method of estimating the size and shape of
    the stationary hollow carved out in a neu ral ionized stream of
    corpuscles impinging on the geomagnetic field a two dimensional
    case is considered in which the permanent field is due to a
    current acting perpendicular to the stream the breadth of the
    hollow at infinity is shown to be finite
