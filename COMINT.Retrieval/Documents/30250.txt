energy bands in the presence of an external force field
    anomalous velocities the theory of field modified energy bands
    is extended to include the effect of weak scattering forces the
    modified current operator is found to contain terms giving
    anomalous currents the theory of these currents is developed
    and their relation to the spontaneous hall effect in
    ferromagnets is considered
