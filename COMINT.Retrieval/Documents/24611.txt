the use of silicon diodes in d c modulators and their
    applications to drift correctors for computing amplifiers
    advantages over the conventional relay modulator include good
    high frequency response low noise level low switching power
    requirements and an operational life limited only by the
    thermionic valves zero stability is comparable wite that of the
    conventional relay
