effect of component tolerances in low frequency selective
    amplifiers an analysis amplifiers with wien bridge or twin t
    selective feedback networks are considered when the networks
    are designed for maximum selectivity the factor of the
    amplifier relatively sensitive variation network component
    value this sensitivity can be reduced by suitable choice of
    component relative values but a higher gain is then required to
    obtain the same selectivity
