a study of whistling atmospherics part diffuseness
    diffuseness defined as the average time duration of whistler
    energy on a fixed frequency is found to be twice as large for
    long as for short whistlers to be independent of season and
    time of day and to be linearly related to geomagnetic latitude
    and whistler dispersion
