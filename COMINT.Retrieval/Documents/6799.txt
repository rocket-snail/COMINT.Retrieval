video disc for the storage of office documents and
    engineering graphics. a description of the optical data disc, a
    means of converting human-readable documentation to
    high-density storage on photo sensitive materials, is given,
    with details of its dimensions and manufacturers. attributes of
    the optical data disc, including data entry, code format,
    replication and projected cost of blank discs, are outlined. a
    comparison of optical data discs and microforms is made, with
    reference to storage capacity, material cost and retrieval
    time. the future availability of the disc is assessed.
