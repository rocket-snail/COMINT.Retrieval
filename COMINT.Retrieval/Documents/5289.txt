vacuum fluctuation noise and dissipation continuation of
    previous investigation of the interaction of an electron beam
    with the field in an enclosed region an expression is derived
    for the observable mean squared emf and is used to calculate
    the fluctuations induced in the beam when interacting with a
    damped oscillator as the damping becomes very large the
    fluctuations approach zero
