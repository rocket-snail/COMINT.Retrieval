drift observations evaluated by the method of similar
    fades a regular interference model is considered as opposed to
    the usual purely random model some of the observed features are
    well explained by a model which lies between these two views
    provided a finite lifetime is assumed for the irregularities
    large changes of drift velocity can be explained by assuming
    small vertical velocities
