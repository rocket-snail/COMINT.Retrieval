current library problems in finland. finland has more
    than 10 library associations, the most important is suomen
    kirjastoseura (the finnish library association), established in
    1910. it is mainly concerned with further education,
    publishing, information and international cooperation. since
    1978, the state grant to public libraries has been increased to
    68%, making finnish public libraries the largest recipients of
    state aid in scandinavia. the 1978 proposal to transfer library
    services from the school board to the education ministry has
    not yet been implemented. nor has any action been taken on the
    finance ministerial working party's report of 1979 on staffing
    and job distribution in public libraries. a 3 year course for
    library assistants was begun in 1978. the finnish library
    association has pointed out that despite reasonable state
    grants, certain sectors, such as county and mobile libraries,
    are inadequately funded. outlines the association's objectives
    for the 1980s.
