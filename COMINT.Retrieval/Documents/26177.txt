horizontal diffusion and the geomagnetic anomaly in the
    equatorial f region equations relating to the diffusion of f
    region ionization parallel to the earths field are stated and
    used to discuss low latitude phenomena one implication of the
    analysis is criticized in the adjoining note which attempts a
    qualitative description of the role of diffusion in the
    equatorial f region
