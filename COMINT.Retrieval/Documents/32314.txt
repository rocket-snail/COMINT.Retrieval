analysis of transient processes in diode detection by a
    method based on the use of low frequency equivalent circuits a
    method is proposed for analysing the transient processes in a
    system consisting of a hf amplifier and a diode detector the
    method is based on the linear approximation of the processes
    occurring during detection and on the replacement of the
    detector and of the amplifier circuits by equivalent lf
    circuits various types of circuits and various shapes of the
    envelopes of the input signal are considered
