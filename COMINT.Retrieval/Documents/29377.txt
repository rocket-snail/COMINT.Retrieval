the motion of ionized gas in combined magnetic electric
    and mechanical fields of force transient electric and
    mechanical forces uniform in space are applied to a gas in the
    presence of a steady magnetic field the current transport
    equation for the anisotropically conducting medium is used to
    determine the subsequent motion of the gas the internal
    electric field and the current density these are damped
    oscillatory functions leading to a steady state there is a
    close connection between the effects of the electric and
    mechanical forces a steady internal electric field
    perpendicular to the magnetic field cannot exist unless
    accompanied by a mechanical force the relationship between the
    two is examined
