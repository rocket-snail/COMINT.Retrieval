pulse techniques in microwave spectroscopy methods are
    described for exciting gases to states from which they emit
    coherent spontaneous radiation in the microwave frequency
    region the excitation is produced by the application of short
    pulses of microwave power the power subsequently radiated by
    the gas is calculated for several cases and experimental
    methods used to detect the radiation are described the problem
    of sensitivity is discussed and compared to the sensitivity
    obtainable i a continuous absorption experiment the operation
    of a high resolution microwave spectrometer which produces
    lines substantially narrower than the usual doppler width is
    described the method used to stabilize the klystron used in
    these experiments which is a modification of the pound method
    is given
