thermal diffusion in ionized gases the thermal diffusion
    factor which is less than unity in a neutral gas mixture is of
    order in an ionized gas where is the ionic charge in a mixed
    ionized gas containing also a small proportion of heavy ions
    the factor can be much greater and give increased heavy ion
    density in the hotter regions this effect may be of importance
