a simple numeric filing system for 7.5- and 15-minute
    topographic maps' the mclane system. paper presented at the
    43rd annual meeting of the association of pacific coast
    geographers, reno, june 80. until aug 79, mines library, part
    of the university of nevada library, reno, arranged all of its
    us geological survey 7&h-minute and 15-minute topographic
    maps alphabetically by state and quadrangle name, but adjacent
    quadrangles are then not filed together. alvin mclane,
    consultant, devised a new system' the mclane system' using the
    2usgs index to topographic maps1, each 15-minute quadrangle is
    numbered consecutively from west to east starting from the
    northwest corner of the state with number one, and assigning
    numbers to quadrangles regardless of whether they have been
    mapped. describes the advantages and flexibility, and some of
    the disadvantages of the system. for a local or regional
    collection, the investment in time in setting up and using the
    system would be minimal and the rewards of ea se of accessing
    and filing would be substantial.
