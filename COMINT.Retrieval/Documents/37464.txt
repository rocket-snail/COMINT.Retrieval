library provision for people with sight problems in the
    german democratic republic, with special reference to the
    activities of the german central library for the blind in
    leipzig. the library, founded in 1894, has taken over all
    selection, production, presentation and sales of literature for
    the blind and partially sighted in east germany. loan stocks
    include about 7,000 books and 6,000 scores in braille and over
    3,000 talking books. more than 1,000 titles are available for
    sale. generally users prefer non-fiction in braille and fiction
    on tape or cassette. many of the 2,000 regular users become
    blind when elderly, so they prefer talking books to braille.
    monthly lists of new additions to stock are published.
    information on new children's books is sent to parents and
    information on large print books to libraries and old people's
    homes. close cooperation is maintained with other organisations
    in this field, especially with schools for the blind and much
    assistance is provided for services in developing
    countries.
