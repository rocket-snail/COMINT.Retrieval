oecd guidelines on privacy protection and transborder
    flows. the guidelines apply to both automated and
    manually-stored personal data, both in the public and private
    sectors. oecd believes there is a danger that legal disparities
    could hamper the free flow of personal data across frontiers,
    and that restrictions could cause serious disruption in such
    areas as banking, insurance, aircraft reservations, and the
    dispatch of confidential data between parent company and
    subsidiary in multinational enterprises. the full text of the
    guidelines is reprinted.
