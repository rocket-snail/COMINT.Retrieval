secondary emission due to bombardment of metallic targets
    with multiple charge ions an experimental investigation of the
    dependence of the coefficient of secondary emission on the
    energy of the ions sb bi and te targets were bombarded with sb
    bi and te ions respectively and ni targets with na ba and ca
    ions the results are shown graphically
