local collections in british public libraries. the
    librarian in charge of local history collections in uk public
    libraries collections will need to scan local papers and
    journals for references to local events and for reviews of
    books and other material of interest. he should make contact
    with local firms and associations in an attempt to obtain their
    publications and scan the sales catalogues of second-hand
    booksellers and auctioneers for out-of-print material. the main
    problem facing local collections is the lack of qualified
    staff, without which the library cannot provide a service to
    the growing number of interested enquirers.
