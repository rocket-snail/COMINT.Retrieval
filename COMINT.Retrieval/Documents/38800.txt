response of a linear network to an input with linearly
    variable frequency as obtained in sweep frequency testing
    application of an input voltage with linearly increasing
    frequency to a linear network produces an output curve which
    for very slow frequency variation is an image of the admittance
    plotted as a function of frequency when the rate of frequency
    variation is not negligible the response curve is a distorted
    image of the admittance the nature of this distortion is
    investigated a quantitative approximation method is presented
    which uses the theory of functions for evaluation of an
    integral the result is expressible in terms of elementary
    functions explicit expressions are given for the dynamic
    corrections to be applied to the observed resonance frequencies
    and peak admittances the method is applied to several simple
    circuits in addition to the lcr circuit which has been
    previously treated by other authors
