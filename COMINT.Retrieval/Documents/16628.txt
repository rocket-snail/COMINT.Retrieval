aids to libraries in the purchase of medical periodicals.
    10 bibliographies of medical periodicals are described, not all
    suitable for german medical libraries. a method was developed
    from the citation frequency of periodicals for finding out the
    basic important periodicals. a comparison was made between
    requests for periodicals from ulm and cologne and a list of an
    international range of publications made. the new list is
    considered to be as close as possible to a medical library's
    basic needs; all except the smallest hospital libraries would
    require larger stocks. the number of current periodicals taken
    by a library should depend on' the number of readers and
    requests; and the availability of the periodicals.
