optimizing selection of library school students. attempts
    to assess the effectiveness of admission requirements such as
    grade point average, gre test scores, personal references, work
    experience and personal goals statements in predicting student
    performance in specific library science classes and throughout
    a library school master's degree programme. suggests that the
    factors which predict performance best are different for each
    class, but previous grade point average and the gre
    quantitative test score predict overall student performance
    better than any other test variables.
