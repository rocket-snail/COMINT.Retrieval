the public library as a social milieu. in denmark the
    public library is the centre of communication and culture,
    since there is more emphasis here than in germany on theatrical
    and musical activities. libraries are built mainly from wood,
    slate and glass, with a structure designed to suit a wide range
    of activities; they are always situated centrally within their
    area. puppet theatres, toys, facilities for painting and
    listening to music and even little push-chairs for the smallest
    children are provided in libraries with a large proportion of
    child readers. all libraries contain at least one room for
    meetings. basic stocks always contain german and english
    language material and talking books for the old and partially
    sighted. books are taken out to the housebound and handicapped;
    libraries even supply children's books for use in
    paediatricians' waiting-rooms.
