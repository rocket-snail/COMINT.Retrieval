a generic i and r center serves specialized needs. the
    information center of hampton roads is a regional human
    services information system scanning 9 cities and 6 counties in
    southeastern virginia. its experience is discussed to support
    the premise that specialised information and referral services
    for people with special needs can be more effectively provided
    as a component of a sound generic information and referral
    system than if separately organised. services for the disabled
    are being integrated into its programme.
