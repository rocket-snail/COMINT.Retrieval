the effect of interpretive techniques on functional
    design of computers analysis of the programmes for a number of
    computations performed by the computer indicates the
    feasibility of designing an adaptable and reliable computer
    having only a relatively small amount of rapid access erasable
    store and a larger amount of rapid access non erasable store in
    which would be held all interpretation routines function block
    ets the operator would require no knowledge of the actual
    machine code but wou d place his hyper programmes and data into
    a slow speed backing store
