the indian council of library and information services
    research and training: a proposal for consideration. critically
    examines the indian library scene. the management, operation,
    and services of most libraries is inefficient and ineffective,
    resulting in grave misallocation and underutilisation of
    library resources. little major research has been carried out.
    university librarianship courses are not much help for managing
    and operating libraries efficiently. the major national
    institutions have serious limitations. to improve the
    situation, proposes the establishment of an indian council of
    library and information services research and training. the
    council would be set up by the government and have well-defined
    roles and functions covering all aspects of indian
    librarianship.
