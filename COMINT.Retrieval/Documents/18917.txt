the case of charged density distribution versus
    semipermanent polarization as a basis for electret behavior it
    is shown that if an electret were composed of ordinary charge
    distributions its effects would diminish by in a day or two the
    observed effects indicate the existence of a semi permanent
    polarization and can be regarded as arising from a lag in the
    cancelling action of conductivity
