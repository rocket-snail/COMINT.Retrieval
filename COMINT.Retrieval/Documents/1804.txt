the morphology of the ionospheric variations associated
    with magnetic disturbance part variations at moderately low
    latitudes graphs of the ionospheric variations with local time
    and with storm time at watheroo canberra and washington re
    given the local time variations are mainly diurnal the storm
    time variations are appreciable for about three days after the
    commencement of the magnetic storm and the initial shape of the
    curve depends on the local time of the commencement a theory of
    these variations is developed all ionospheric variations due to
    magnetic disturbance are attributed to the es field produced by
    the auroral regions
