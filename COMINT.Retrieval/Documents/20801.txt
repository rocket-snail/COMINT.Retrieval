a new approach to optimum filtering in filter problems if
    enough is known about the signal and the noise to describe them
    accurately by their power spectra conventional methods based on
    wieners original method will provide the most effective filters
    an alternative procedure for computing optimum filters based on
    description of the signal in terms of a partial sum of
    orthogonal functions is presented this will specify good
    filters with far less labour than is necessary in the wiener
    method and it has a wider range of practical application a
    table of summation orthogonal analogues of the laguerre
    functions which are useful in this procedure is appended
