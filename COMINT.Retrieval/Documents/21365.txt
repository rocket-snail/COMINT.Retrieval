library work among delhi's illiterates. describes delhi
    public library, opened in 1951. borrowing is free, although
    there is an initial deposit too high for many people. the
    library runs 4 regional libraries with 20 branch libraries,
    eventually to be self-governing. it also has deposit
    collections in 3 hospitals, the prison, and institutions for
    the blind, using the library's own braille books. materials
    have to be in many languages, with hindi, urdu, punjabi and
    english the most common. there is an adult lending section,
    reading room, reference section, and children's section; the
    latter is, however, given low priority. the library arranges
    free activities for adults and children, such as films,
    book-talks, author work-shops, and organises study groups. the
    book selection procedures are somewhat haphazard; stress is on
    indian and western classics. some popular scientific works are
    now available in hindi. delhi public library appears a
    traditional western library service, with little attempt to
    cater for the mass of illiterate and potential users.
