investigation of the relative positions of solar radio
    storm sources and of associated optical centres of activity a
    comparison has been made between the mean positions of radio
    storm centres observed sunspots results show a systematic
    difference between the apparent and true positions of the
    former and for more intense storm centres a directivity effect
    with latitude
