notes on the distribution of in high latitudes an
    examination of experimental data shows that the equivalent
    overhead currents for the preliminary reverse impulse in this
    type of magnetic storm in the northern hemisphere are
    represented by current flows across the polar cap from the
    longitude corresponding to that corresponding to and by the
    resulting two vortices extending to lower latitudes a clockwise
    vortex in the afternoon hemisphere and a weaker counter
    clockwise vortex in the forenoon hemisphere
