conditions for aperiodicity in linear systems the
    necessary and sufficient conditions are derived when expressed
    in terms of the coefficients of the characteristic equation
    they take the form of a number of simple determinantal
    inequalities which are closely analogous to the rough hurwitz
    stability criteria
