atmospheric oscillations at high altitudes and their
    relation to geomagnetic field variations equations developed
    previously of august chakrabarty and pratap are used to
    calculate the s variations of h ad v by assuming different
    phases for the atmospheric oscillations in the ionosphere layer
    which is the seat of the ring currents and comparing the
    results with observed variations of the magnetic field a phase
    of is found to give the best fit
