a comparative study of relevance judgements by users and
    non-users of a selective dissemination of information service.
    extract from a brazilian dissertation in information science,
    describing an investigation carried out in the scientific
    information and documentation division at the sao paulo
    institute of atomic energy, following the change over in 1974
    from a manual to an automated service. a summary of the
    preliminary review of the literature relating to relevance
    theories, previous studies, and methodology, is presented.
    details are given of the methodology, based on document titles,
    developed for this study to rate judgements and collect data.
    results are reported in full and analysed; the calculation
    procedures are explained and demonstrated. it was concluded
    that user and non-user judgements were largely similar;
    disagreements were attributed to inconsistencies between
    subjective user and objective non-user evaluation criteria.
    finally the effectiveness of titles in determining rel evance
    was considered, and the conclusion drawn that frequency of
    profile descriptors in document titles did not differentiate
    relevant from non-relevant documents.
