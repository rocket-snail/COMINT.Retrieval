pre-aacr2 special records: cornell's experience with a
    closed catalog. partly because of the conflicting forms of
    entry for serial and monograph titles in aacr2, and due to the
    increasing difficulty involed in maintaining an 8 1/2 million
    card catalogue, the union dictionary catalog in cornell
    university's olin research library was closed on 31 dec 80. at
    the beginning of 1981 a new catalogue-the supplemental
    catalog-was opened, and supplemental catalogs also replaced
    other catalogues on the cornell campus. serials in the
    supplemental catalogs are catalogued entirely according to
    aacr2, and monographs have aacr2 name headings but include some
    hybrid records with pre-aacr2 descriptive elements. the closure
    and new cataloguing are described in detail.
