study of an electronic antiresonant circuit theory is
    given of a circuit which can either be used as a low pass
    filter or as an antiresonant circuit the operation of the
    circuit in the steady state in response to an applied
    sinusoidal voltage and in the transient regime in response to a
    unit step voltage is analysed as an antiresonant circuit it is
    more selective than a double t rc circuit its characteristics
    can be varied within wide limits and the values of the
    components can easily be calculated from the characteristics
    specified its high selectivity independent of the cut off
    frequency makes it particularly suitable for use at very low
    frequencies
