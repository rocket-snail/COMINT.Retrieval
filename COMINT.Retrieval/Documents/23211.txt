voltage current characteristics of semiconductor power
    rectifiers the distribution of the concentration of carriers of
    pin and pnn types is examined monomolecular and bimolecular
    recombinations are considered the dependence of the injection
    coefficient on the current and the characteristics is
    calculated and the voltage drop in the bulk of the
    semiconductor is investigated
