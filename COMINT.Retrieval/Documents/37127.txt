coaxial transmission line filters analysis for coaxial
    line band pass filters is given based on tem mode transmission
    the influence of the nature and spacing of the obstacles on the
    bandwidth is discussed measurements on filters of various
    constructions support the theoretical results a te mode high
    pass filter is also discussed for narrow band applications this
    type of filter is inferior to the cavity type
