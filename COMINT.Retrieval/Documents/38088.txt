the impact of user frustration of humanities research.
    reports on a survey to provide information on the consequence
    of user frustration among humanities faculties caused by
    collection inadequacy at virginia polytechnic institute and
    state university. results indicate that such frustration does
    exist, but the lack of a strong humanities collection is not
    deemed to be an unsurmountable impediment to research. the
    freedom and encouragement to travel to primary sources and a
    comfortable work environment with efficient, effective services
    is most important.
