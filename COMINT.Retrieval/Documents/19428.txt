designing secondary services in the social sciences'
    reflections on a research project. the research programme
    'design of information systems in the social sciences' (disiss)
    conducted a large-scale study of secondary serials and their
    effectiveness as information sources in the social sciences. in
    separate investigations the following aspects were studied' (1)
    structure, size and increase of social sciences literature; (2)
    nature and degree of coverage and overlap within the separate
    disciplines and areas of the social sciences; (3) design,
    effectiveness and use of secondary services; and (4) an
    analysis of the concentration and scattering within the subject
    areas, languages, and date distribution of citations appearing
    in social science materials. suggestions are made for the
    development of alternative solutions.
