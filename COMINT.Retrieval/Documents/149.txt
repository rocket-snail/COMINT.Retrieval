radio emission from an atomic explosion in an atomic
    explosion which is accompanied by asymmetric emission of quanta
    radio waves are emitted due to the presence of a current in the
    ionized air the duration of the oscillation in each halfwave is
    of the order of for a given asymmetry in emission of the rays
    the amplitude of the oscillations depends weakly on the total
    number of quanta
