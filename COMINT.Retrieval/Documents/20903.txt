investigation of the transverse motion of ions in a
    discharge in a strong longitudinal magnetic field the influence
    of the gas pressure on the average transverse velocity of ions
    was investigated using a rotating probe in an argon discharge
    it was found that for pressures and in spite of a strong
    magnetic field of about oersteds a considerable quantity of
    ions reached the side walls of the discharge chamber so that an
    estimate could be made of the energy acquired by the ions in
    the radial electric field
