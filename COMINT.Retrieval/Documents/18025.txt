the physically handicapped and the public library.
    discusses attempts to make public libraries more accessible to
    handicapped people in the usa. changes in the laws have
    encouraged the making of all public buildings accessible to the
    handicapped. this has led to new standards for building and the
    renovation of old buildings some of which have required
    considerable work. the new laws have caused controversy in
    small towns with few, if any, handicapped people over who
    should pay for renovation work. concludes that clearer
    guidelines should be established to make the law more flexible
    and to guarantee that small town buildings such as libraries
    are in compliance with specific alternative services. the
    federal government should also consider providing funding for
    accessibility renovations.
