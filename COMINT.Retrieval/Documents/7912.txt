skamokowa story' rural library service in washington
    state. skamokawa, a village of 250 population, in washington's
    2nd smallest county, wahkiakum, has, in the last few years,
    gained a library. the nucleus of the collection came from the
    local school, but the library now boasts a book collection,
    paperbacks, interlibrary loan services, a film borrowing
    service, and a reference service. volunteers provide remedial
    reading, tutoring, and instruction in french. the library is
    dependent on donated funds, and fund-raising is an ever present
    chore. volunteer help is erratic and lack of time has prevented
    the librarian from cataloguing the collection. the library
    succeeds, ultimately, through community determination, and,
    operating on the premise that something is better than nothing,
    cares for the individual by providing what is really wanted by
    the population it serves.
