library research-scrutiny of an investigation. comments
    on the report by the library school's working party on a
    programme for library research. approves the programme's stress
    on research qualifications for the library school staff. the
    programme is the 1st attempt at a survey and analysis of
    library research in sweden and rightly stresses the need for
    data on the different attitudes to and use of libraries by the
    arts and the sciences. but it neglects an obvious research
    area-cooperation between different types of library for
    efficient use of scarce resources. in a time of economic
    difficulties it becomes necessary to carry out research which
    may provide arguments vis-a-vis the grant giving authorities
    for 'non-quantifiable income' or service improvements. the
    emphasis in the programme will at 1st rightly be on user
    studies and studies aimed at improving services.
