the suitability of the caribbean situation for
    establishing library networks. translated by carlos gil.
    analyses the possibility of successfully implementing automated
    library networks in the caribbean, in relation to the actual
    social, political and economic circumstances. the discussion
    covers the role of technology in promoting development; the
    need for and likelihood of cooperation among the caribbean
    states; the probable impact of new technology imported from the
    developed world; and the ability of caribbean libraries to
    implement automated programmes and adapt to them. concludes
    that the oclc type network model is not suitable for the
    caribbean situation, requiring too great an investment without
    concrete evidence that the physical, political and social
    obstacles to cooperation could be overcome. recommends instead
    a detailed investigation of library and telecommunication
    resources, with a view to developing an indigenous
    network.
