video fever. libraries' fascination with video is
    resulting in some alarming trends. media collections are being
    unduly influenced in favour of public films-on-video,
    jeopardising the concept of collection-building for the entire
    population; media formats are being confused-because feature
    films are the main content of home video, many think that the
    terms film, videotape, and videodisc are interchangeable; and
    there is the manipulation of libraries and information by the
    video entrepreneurs who have invested millions in the new
    format and nothing in the concept of equal access to all
    information. the new video technologies do have great
    potential, but it is not financially realisable or practicable
    for libraries. libraries must maintain their high standards and
    continue to collect all media.
