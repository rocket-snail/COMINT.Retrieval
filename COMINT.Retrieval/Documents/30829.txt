disturbances in the lower ionosphere observed at vhf
    following the solar flare of february with particular reference
    to auroral zone absorption the effects of the flare on
    ionospheric scatter links in the band at high latitudes are
    reported an abrupt increase in oblique incidence signal
    intensity occurring almost simultaneously with the arrival of
    cosmic rays was following during during the next three days by
    abnormally high levels at night and low levels during the day
    background cosmic noise measurements showed increased
    absorption at night and greatly increased absorption during day
    light the penetration into the d region of moderately heavy
    solar atomic ions is suggested as an explanation of the
    absorption phenomena
