the first census of australian library services.
    discusses the 1st aacobs (australian advisory council on
    bibliographic services) task force on statistics, 1973-81 and
    problems of definition and evaluation in relation to the
    collection of quantitative and qualitative statistics for
    librarianship. shortcomings which emerged in the task force's
    necessarily exploratory approach are acknowledged, and there is
    some comment about the relative values of differing materials
    held by australian libraries, and of divergencies in approaches
    to library measurement in some sectors of the professional
    community.
