transient processes in a trigger circuit with a
    transistor transient processes in a common base circuit using a
    point contact transistor are considered expressions for the
    currents are derived and the speed of operation of the circuit
    is estimated requirements are formulated for point contact
    transistors to be used in high speed trigger circuits see also
