theory of a fast switching electron beam frequency
    coherence and bandwidth of a gas discharge harmonic generator
    long time delays from a single magnetic storage core time
    delays up to several minutes can be accurately achieved using
    an assymetrical bidirectional core voltage the delay may be
    controlled by a d c voltage or current change or by a change of
    resistance
