properties of selenium rectifiers with various impurities
    se rectifiers were prepared with halogen and halogen compound
    impurities and their characteristics were investigated the
    effect of fluorine and fluorine compounds on the conductivity
    was nil that of alkali halides small and that of bromine
    pronounced thallium bromide copper bromide tellurium and
    arsenic have a deleterious effect on the rectifier properties
    results also show that useful rectifiers can be made using very
    pure se
