richard minskey's brainchild' the center for book arts.
    the center for book arts, manhattan, new york, exists to
    educate the public about how fine books are made and provides
    workshops to foster the creation of such works. the center was
    created in 1974 by richard minsky to combine his 2
    interests-hand bookbinding and economics. the center offers
    courses in the book arts, including hand bookbinding,
    restoration, wood engraving and letterpress printing. qualified
    artists and craftmakers are allowed to use the facilities for a
    modest rental fee. the center has become an information
    exchange, working to keep abreast of current developments, and
    focusing attention on the importance of books in history and
    present life.
