direct coupled waveguide filters filters are considered
    of the type comprising chains of cavity resonators with a
    common iris separating adjacent cavities design methods based
    respectively on impedance considerations wave matrices and
    equivalence between the waveguide filter and the lumped element
    filter are described for determining the susceptance of the
    irises and their separation theory is given for the case of
    mismatching and formulae are derived for parallel and cascade
    couplings a four channel branching system for frequencies
    ranging from to is described
