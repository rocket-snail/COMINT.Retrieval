resonance characteristics by conformal mapping the
    expression where is termed the resonance function it represents
    the impedance of the series connected lrs circuit or the
    admittance of the parallel connected circuit to conformal
    mapping of the plane on to the plane gives a figure which
    illustrates the meaning of the resonance function for complex
    frequencies typical examples illustrate the application of the
    figure to the parallel circuit and to one of its intrinsic
    generalizations the mapping of the reciprocal functions and is
    also considered
