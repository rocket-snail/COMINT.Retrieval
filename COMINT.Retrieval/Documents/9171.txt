linear network synthesis the rational fraction
    approximation is obtained dire tly in terms of the pole zero
    locations in the plane by a process of successive approximation
    the method differs from others known successive approximation
    techniques in being purely graphical apart from a final
    numerical relaxation process a simple step by step account is
    given of the practical procedure
