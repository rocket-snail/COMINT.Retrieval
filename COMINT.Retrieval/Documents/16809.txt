homogeneous dynamos and terrestrial magnetism solutions
    of maxwells equations are obtained for a sphere of electrically
    conducting fluid in which there are specified velocities
    solutions exist when harmonics up to degree four are included
    but for a greater number of harmonics the convergence of
    solutions has not been proved orders of magnitude are derived
    for a number of quantities connected with the dynamo theory of
    terrestrial magnetism
