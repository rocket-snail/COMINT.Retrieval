end fired memory uses ferrite plates magnetic flux is
    induced around corresponding holes in two adjacent plates and
    in this way irregularities in the material from hole to hole do
    not affect the accuracy storing and switching systems using
    plates are described and suitable transistor drive and
    regeneration circuits are given
