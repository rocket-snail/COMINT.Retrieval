fluctuation noise in a microwave superregenerative
    amplifier the theory of operation of a superregenerative
    amplifier is reviewed rices representation of noise current by
    a fourier series of and back references is used in the
    expression for the amplifier output a study is made of the
    particular conditions when a reflex klystron is used in the
    amplifier expressions are derived for the noise figure in terms
    f the klystron parameters the overs overall noise figure can be
    reduced by introducing beam current with its associated shot
    noise during the quiescent interval
