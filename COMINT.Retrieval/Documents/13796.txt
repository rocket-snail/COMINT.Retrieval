on the introduction of viewdata in the field of
    information and documentation. part 1. 'bildschirmtext' (btx)
    is a viewdata system similar to prestel which is being
    developed in west germany by the federal post office. btx
    registered users will be able to enter the system by telephone.
    a colour television screen as a display device and an
    instrument with a digital keyboard will also be necessary.
    information providers will need a keyboard similar to that of a
    typewriter with some additional characters to obtain graphics.
    at present the system is mainly oriented to users with digital
    keyboards which means that all information has to be made
    available through numerical identification. facility selection
    is made through an index process prepared by the user. the
    procedure could be speeded up by creating a users' catalogue
    such as prestel provides. if btx storage facilities are
    expanded and the speed of access is improved it should provide
    additional possibilities for connecting general and t echnical
    information systems. care should be taken to integrate this new
    service without duplicating existing information and
    documentation services.
