improvement of the frequency stability of a high
    frequency oscillator frequency modulated by means of a
    condenser microphone a frequency stabilizing system is
    described in which the condenser microphone serves
    simultaneously for frequency modulation and as an es control
    element the system finds application in miniature vhf
    transmitters and eliminates the need for crystal control
