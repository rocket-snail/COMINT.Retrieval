quantum analogue of the ferromagnetic microwave amplifier
    certain resemblances between the modes of operation of the
    three level maser and the ferromagnetic microwave amplifier are
    shown to be superficial by constructing a quantum mechanical
    model of the latter device it is shown that while establishment
    of a negative temperature for two levels is essential in the
    three level maser it is inessential in the analogue of the
    ferromagnetic amplifier which in essence depends only on the
    time varying part of the density matrix
