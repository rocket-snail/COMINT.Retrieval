definition of the ideal transformer and the ideal gyrator
    by their impedance transforming properties the fundamental
    difference between the two networks is that the input impedance
    of the ideal transformer is directly proportional to the load
    impedance while for the ideal gyrator the proportionality is
    inverse the ideal gyrator can be completely defined as a
    passive linear loss free quadripole with frequency independent
