ionospheric storms and the geomagnetic anomaly in the f
    layer graphs are shown of hourly values of the ratio of
    critical frequency on magnetically disturbed days to that on
    quiet days for wakkanai during the winter hourly values of the
    ratio of critical frequency at ottawa to that at wakkanai
    during the winter the shape of the graphs is similar indicating
    that the geomagnetic distortion anomaly in the f layer is such
    that it causes a minimum of critical frequency in the forenoon
    and a maximum in the afternoon for huancayo the principal
    anomaly is the abnormal maintenance of high f values after
    sunset
