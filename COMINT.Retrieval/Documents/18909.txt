    social science information transfer; the role of international
    networks of institutions; some international organisations
    which promote information transfer; and computerised
    information transfer systems. concludes that international
    cooperation is gaining momentum, it is particularly important

    must acquire, early in their training, an attitude of
    cooperation rather than the 'do-it-yourself' attitude.
