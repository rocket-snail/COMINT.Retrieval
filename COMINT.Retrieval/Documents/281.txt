catholic library work in germany. the roman catholic
    public libraries developed in the 19th century with the advent
    of popular education. the libraries are to be found today in
    hospitals, and other institutions and in the parishes; their
    aim is to provide education, social communication and help for
    the underprivileged. the largest have stocks of up to 30,000
    items but average totals are between 1,500-5,000 items of
    lending and reference material for children and adults. staff
    are mainly volunteers, although full-time professionals are
    employed in the diocesan centres, responsible for planning and
    finance, staff training and representation of library interests
    within their diocese. overall control is maintained by st.
    michael's league in bavaria and by the borromeus association in
    the rest of germany, who provide a number of centralised
    services.
