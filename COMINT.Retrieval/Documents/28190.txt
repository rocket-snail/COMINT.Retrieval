the unesco cds/isis system. unesco's cds/isis
    (computerised documentation system/integrated set of
    information systems) is a generalised computer-based system for
    information processing, storage, and retrieval, which was
    developed for internal use in 1975. in response to
    international interest, it is now available to organisations in
    the united nations family and member states, without charge.
    unesco trains users, regularly informs them of system
    developments, visits them, offers technical advice, and has
    published back-up documentation.
