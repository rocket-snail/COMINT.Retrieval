microwave measurements of the radiation temperature of
    plasmas measurements are described of radiation temperature of
    positive columns of glow discharges in helium neon and hydrogen
    the microwave noise radiation was detected at the results are
    compared with calculations and with langmuir probe measurements
    of the electron temperature
