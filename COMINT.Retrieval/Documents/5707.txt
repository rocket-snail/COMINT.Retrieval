monovibrator has fast recovery time use of complementary
    transistors decreases recovery time of monostable multivibrator
    this prevents erratic operation when circuit is used in a
    television sync generator since both transistors are off during
    timing cycle circuit is relatively insensitive to transistor
    variations and operates reliably from to for input frequencies
