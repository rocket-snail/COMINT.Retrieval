viscosity in the region it is shown that viscosity is of
    primary importance for disturbances whose scale is smaller than
    the mean free path and cannot be described by an effective
    coefficient any initial disturbance on such a small scale will
    disappear very rapidly assuming normally accepted values for a
    altitude it follows that patches of ionization causing the
    twinkling of radio stars cannot be due to turbulence in the
    neutral gas as suggested by
