corpuscular eclipse in the f layer and its association
    with solar flares and m regions a survey of present knowledge
    on solar sources of corpuscular streams and on corpuscular
    velocities the drop in the f layer ion density occurring
    approximately five hours before the maximum of the optical
    solar eclipse is briefly discussed and it is suggested that in
    future f layer observations should commence at least seven
    hours before the moment of totality
