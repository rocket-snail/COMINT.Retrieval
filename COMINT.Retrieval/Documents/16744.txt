directory of industrial information services and systems
    in developing countries. developing nations have come to
    recognise that industrial and technological information is a
    key element in accelerating the process of industrialisation.
    in recent years, an increasing number of industrial and
    technological information centres have been established in
    developing countries. the types of services they perform and
    the subjects on which they provide information are varied. the
    aim of the present directory is to make more widely known and
    to promote the full use of existing industrial and
    technological information facilites in the developing
    countries.
