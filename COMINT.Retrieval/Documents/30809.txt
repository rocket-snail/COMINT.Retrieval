simulation vf inductance by an integrating circuit an
    operational amplifier used as integrator has an inductive input
    impedance when a resesthve feedback loop is added between input
    and output theoretical and measured ualues of inductance
    qfactor and selfcapacitance are given and the possibility of
    raising q by positive feedback is examined
