the need for professional and ideo-political awareness.
    all types of libraries (school, public and trade union) have to
    impart the ideas of the 12th communist party congress to the
    entire bulgarian nation. the communist congress outlined
    economic, social and cultural policies which have to be
    implemented by workers in industry and in agriculture acting in
    a disciplined and responsible way. librarians must use a
    systematic and personal approach and deal with the class
    struggle, the role of the ussr in the world, the general
    international situation and many other topics on all the
    required levels. librarians should display relevant literature,
    arrange exhibitions and discussion meetings, and compile
    recommended bibliographies. these are only a few suggestions
    which must be implemented to reach the set goals.
