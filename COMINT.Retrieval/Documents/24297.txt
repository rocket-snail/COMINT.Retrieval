new representation of the longitude effect in the
    ionosphere f layer the representation is based on a chart with
    geographic latitude as abscissa and magnetic latitude as
    ordinate on plotting the positions of existing ionospheric
    stations the need for stations in certain regions is
    demonstrated particularly for stations with south geographic
    and north magnetic latitude
