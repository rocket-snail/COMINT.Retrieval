history of the kfar gil'adi library-a case study of
    kibbutz libraries (in hebrew). traces the development of kfar
    gil'adi's library, on the assumption that development was
    similar in other veteran kibbutzim. it is based mostly on oral
    and written documentation-a lengthy interview with haim
    yisraeli, founder of the library, minutes of kibbutz general
    meetings and written reports by librarians. when yisraeli
    arrived in kfar gil'adi in 1934 he found about 250 books.
    together with his wife he voluntarily organised the collection
    and enhanced it so that in 1938 it contained 10,000 volumes and
    became an important institution in the cultural life of the
    kibbutz members. today the library is no longer a cultural
    centre and the collection does not meet the needs of the
    members. discusses ways in which the library could once more
    become an important centre for the community.
