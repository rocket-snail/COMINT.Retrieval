solid state maser amplifier the operation of a solid
    state maser amplifier at is described a dual frequency cavity
    containing paramagnetic potassium chromicyanide in an
    isomorphous cobalt diluent is used at k the upper three of the
    four energy levels of the cr ion are used spin state
    populations are inverted by saturating the resonance absorption
    at the experimental observations of the maser both as an
    amplifier and as an oscillator are compared with theory
