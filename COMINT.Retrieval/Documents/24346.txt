some characteristics of sdi systems (experience of the
    central scientific research institute for information and
    economic research for the oil industry). discusses the sdi
    system developed by the central scientific research institute
    for information and economic research for the oil industry. the
    system is used to provide sdi to 2 main groups of users'
    scientists and management officers. as far as the 1st user
    group is concerned the operation of the sdi service is
    successful. in 1978, out of the 150,000 sdi items sent out,
    only 15% were returned by the users as irrelevant. as far as
    the latter user group is concerned, the contact between the
    information centre and the members of the group is not
    satisfactory. a survey of the sdi requirements was therefore
    carried out. results are presented.
