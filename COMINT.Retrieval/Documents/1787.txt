organizational issues for library automation' a network
    perspective. discusses why there are so many problems with the
    development of new services and products (by both commercial
    and non-profit vendors of automation) to meet the needs of
    libraries; why after years of planning and preparation, whole
    sub-systems do not function or perform at unacceptable levels
    or prices; and why, in the continuing exchange between regional
    library networks and national companies and agencies, there are
    so few achievements in cooperation, joint development and
    funding, and close working relationships. vendors must stop
    using professional marketers in planning developments; they
    must communicate directly with libraries instead. they should
    also cooperate amongst themselves and realise the potential of
    working with library networks rather than individual network
    members.
