the calculation of the electron density in the ionosphere
    from elevation angle measurements on artificial satellites when
    a transmitting satellite travels below the peak of the f layer
    measurements of the angle of arrival of the received signal
    show a minimum the value of which is related to the local
    satellite electron density
