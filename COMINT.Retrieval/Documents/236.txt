on artificial geomagnetic and ionospheric storms
    associated with high altitude explosions the electron density
    in the outer ionosphere sudden changes in the virtual height of
    radio waves reflected from the e region of the ionosphere it is
    shown that the lower level reflections are from thin layers
    within the normal e region the changes in amplitude are used to
    deduce the thickness of these layers and the electronic
    collision frequency in the e region
