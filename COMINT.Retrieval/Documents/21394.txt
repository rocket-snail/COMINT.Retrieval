one dimensional impurity bands the density of states of
    one dimensional crystals consisting of functions randomly
    distributed has been calculated on the ibm computer the chains
    contained impurity atoms and the most probable error in the
    integrated density of states at various energies was estimated
    to be at most calculations were performed for various values of
    the parameter where is the density of atoms and the attenuation
    constant appropriate to the isolated bound state the results at
    different densities are compared with those obtained from
    various physical models
