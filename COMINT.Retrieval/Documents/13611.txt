a point contact transistor scaling circuit with
    resolution simple circuits using normal point contact
    transistors are described features contributing to the short
    resolving time are the prevention of bottoming of collector
    potential and the absence of capacitors a typical scale of ten
    circuit uses seven transistors seven pulse transformers and
    crystal diodes wide tolerances on the transistor parameters are
    permissible
