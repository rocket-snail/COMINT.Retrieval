learned societies and on-demand book publishing. a survey
    was made of 220 uk learned societies in the fields of arts,
    humanities and social sciences. the aim was to assess whether
    they had excess book-length material which they considered
    worthy of publication but could not afford to publish. further,
    they were asked whether they had considered the option of
    on-demand (od) publishing and what features an on-demand system
    should have. of 101 usable responses, 24 said that they did
    have such an excess, totalling 160 manuscripts. overall, 38
    felt that there was a need for some centrally organised od
    facility. the most important features of such a system would be
    quality control, price and hard-copy availability.
