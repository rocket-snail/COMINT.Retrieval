development of a format for abstracting dose-response
    information from published studies for use in quantitative
    structure-activity relationships (qsars). the toxic substances
    control act subjects some 70,000 chemicals to regulatory
    action. however, empirical testing of the biological activities
    of this number of compounds is not feasible. an attractive
    alternative is the development of predictive methodology which
    can be used to estimate the potency of an untested compound
    toward a specific biological receptor. prerequisite to such an
    enterprise is the highly systematic compilation of
    dose-response information for a wide range of biological end
    points and for a wide variety of molecular species. a format is
    described for abstracting relevant information from published
    studies. the format outlines the test system, experimental
    conditions, response analysis, exposure protocol, and results
    and presents the original data, all in an organised form.
    regression analysis is used to estimate thres holds and
    potencies in the various test systems. the data may then be
    used to develop a predictive methodology.
