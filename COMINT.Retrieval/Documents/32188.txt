effects of vertical diffusion of electrons near the
    magnetic equator the effects are shown to account for the major
    features of the geomagnetic anomaly discussed by croom et al
    the anomaly is an excess of ionization due to diffusion away
    from the equator rather than a deficiency of ionization due to
    diffusion away from the equator rather than a deficiency of
    ionization at the equator
