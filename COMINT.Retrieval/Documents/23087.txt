cross data base searching. contribution to a thematic
    issue on on-line technology. argues that the continued growth
    of on-line information retrieval services has increased the
    number of data bases consulted for any one search, and so has
    brought about changes in the role of the searcher and the
    on-line service vendor. describes how us data base vendor sdc
    search service has responded to the need for cross data base
    searching by software modification, standardisation of field
    names and search qualifiers, and by the introduction of a save
    search facility. discusses in detail the use of a particular
    saved search strategy for cross data base searching, and
    emphasises the resulting benefits in terms of efficiency and
    economy.
