secondary electron emission from dielectrics experiments
    are described in which in order to avoid changes in the
    structure of the target due to electron bombardment the primary
    beam was switched on for only so that there was one incident
    electron for about atoms of the emitter surface and the
    destruction of the target could therefore be neglected the
    results obtained are different from those usually quoted a new
    interpretation of the phenomenon is given
