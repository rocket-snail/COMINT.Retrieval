solar activity effect and diurnal variation in the upper
    atmosphere an examination is made of the characteristics of the
    solar activity variations in upper atmosphere density and it is
    suggested that a source of heating from the solar wind must be
    involved as well as solar ultraviolet heating to explain the
    observed effects
