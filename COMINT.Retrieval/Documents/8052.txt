low power blocking oscillators information of use in
    final adjustment of blocking oscillators particularly as
    regards requirements for short rise times and narrow pulses is
    reviewed a linearized equivalent circuit is used to derive an
    explicit expression for pulse duration which gives results in
    agreement with experiment particularly when the grid coupling
    capacitor is small
