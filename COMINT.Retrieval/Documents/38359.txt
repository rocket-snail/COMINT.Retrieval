approaches to forecasting demands for library network
    services. the problem of forecasting monthly demands for
    library network services is considered, especially in terms of
    using forecasts as inputs to policy analysis models and in
    terms of the use of forecasts as an aid to budgeting and
    staffing decisions. forecasting methods considered include
    box-jenkins time-series methodology, adaptive filtering, and
    linear regression. using demand data from the illinois library
    and information network for 1971-78, it is shown that
    fading-memory regression is the most appropriate method, in
    terms of both accuracy and ease of use.
