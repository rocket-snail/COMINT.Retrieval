direct coupled amplifiers with junction transistors a
    balanced dc amplifier circuit is analysed and the theory of its
    operation is developed on the basis of the work by abers and
    moll the problem of balancing the circuit with ideal and with
    commercial type transistors is considered and practical design
    formulae are derived
