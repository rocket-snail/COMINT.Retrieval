on the interlibrary loan map. in questionnaire replies,
    few readers at the opochka regional library knew of the
    interlibrary loans system, (ils). the regional library's
    department of agricultural literature bibliographers produce
    information lists on new accessions, so the reason cannot be
    lack of information on agricultural publications. individual
    work with readers is necessary to discover their true
    requirements. unfortunately some libraries consider the ils an
    optional burden. under ils rules fiction and educational books
    are dispatched only for scientific and productive work.
    problems arise in defining 'educational' books. from july 81 a
    state standard will appear concerning a unified ils and
    introducing certain changes.
