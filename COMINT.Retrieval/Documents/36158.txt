test studies of the reference services of german public
    libraries. in autumn 79 a study of reference services in german
    public libraries was carried out. a researcher posed as a
    library user at selected libraries and answers he received to
    reference queries were then evaluated for comprehensiveness and
    accuracy. the aim of the study was not to assess the quality of
    public library reference services or to single out individual
    libraries; instead it demonstrates a new methodology which can
    produce data beyond the merely quantitative data which
    previously could be interpreted, for the most part, from
    library statistics.
