the ionization of the e layer its measurement and
    relation to solar eruptions criteria for distinguishing between
    normal and abnormal layers are discussed relatively thin layers
    are classed as abnormal their ionization distribution
    corresponds to a power law with index a definition of is given
    which remains valid for complex layers is the highest critical
    frequency of a normal layer preceding or coinciding with the
    first discontinuity between the e and f echoes application of
    this definition to the evaluation of ionosphere observations
    made at freiburg during and leads to greater constancy of the
    daily variations and monthly means of e examination of the
    values of e for three summer months indicates that all
    deviations above the monthly mean are attributable to sudden
    ionospheric disturbances
