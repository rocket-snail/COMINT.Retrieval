on the great importance of th r f radiation from the
    planet jupiter continuation of the previous discussion of the
    observations reported by the cyclic variation of relative
    position of points on jupiter and on the earth is examined
    based on considerations of temperature and composition the
    hypothesis is advanced that the observed radiation is produced
    by continuous eruption of solid electrified blocks of iron with
    linear dimensions of the order of such eruptions could be
    expected in the vicinity of the large red spot on jupiter the
    relevance of the hypothesis to astronautical problems is
    briefly indicated
