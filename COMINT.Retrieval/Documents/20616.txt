the cataloguing of music manuscripts in franconia.
    cataloguing of music manuscripts in franconia was begun in 1977
    by the wurzburg university. the catalogue provides lists of
    locations in roman catholic and evangelical parish churches.
    most of the 1,550 roman catholic items are settings of the
    mass; there is little instrumental music apart from some 19th
    century organ pieces. the 600 manuscripts from evangelical
    churches are mostly in the rossach collection, dating from the
    middle of the 18th century. many compositions are by well-known
    composers from outside franconia of the 18th and 19th
    centuries. collections owned by noble families contain mostly
    secular songs, piano and chamber music. most of the manuscripts
    are in good condition; a few suffering from damp required
    laboratory treatment. the printed music documented at the same
    time was mostly from the 19th century.
