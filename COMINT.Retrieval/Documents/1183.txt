on the characteristic intervals of pulsations of
    diminishing periods in the electromagnetic field of the earth
    and their connection with phenomena in the upper atmosphere
    investigation by highspeed recording of the daily variation of
    the earths em field has shown that during strong magnetic
    storms characteristic intervals of pulsation occur the
    decreasing period of these pulsations can be directly
    correlated with the sharp atmospheric disturbances and the
    development of aurora in lower latitudes records obtained
    during two severe magnetic storms in are discussed
