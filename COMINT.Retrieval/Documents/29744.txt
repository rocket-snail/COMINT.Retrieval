on the formation of the special rules concerning printed
    music for rak. work on the special rules concerning the
    cataloguing of both printed music and sound recordings which
    will be a supplement to rak (regeln fur die alphabetische
    katalogisierung-rules for alphabetical cataloguing) is almost
    complete. it will be known as rak-musik. work has been carried
    out since 1971 by a committee attached to the german library
    institute's commission for alphabetical cataloguing. terms used
    in rak were replaced with similar ones from the world of music
    as far as possible. during the preparation period several
    publications appeared which were used in compiling the rules.
    the isbd (international standard bibliographic description) for
    non-book material was published in parts between 1977-79.
    although the section on sound recordings was not detailed
    enough, the isbd (printed music) was so complex that only some
    parts were selected for inclusion. in future the rak music
    rules should provide a basis for music cataloguing.
