library literacy: who? when? where?. the problem of
    inadequate library education in primary and secondary schools
    has far-reaching results. academic librarians must teach
    students the basics of library use before embarking on
    course-related instruction-all in a very short time and with
    reduced success. school leavers who go directly into the work
    force-the very people who most need and could best profit from
    libraries-will never have effective library access. this makes
    the lives of many poorer and more difficult; denies them some
    measure of satisfaction, success, and happiness; and erodes
    society's ability to deal with critical problems and govern
    itself. children must learn reading, writing, arithmetic, and
    library use together.
