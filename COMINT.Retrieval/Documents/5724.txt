a model of information computer systems. considers the
    calculation of network state probabilities in the stationary
    mode for a particular case of a disconnected 2-centre network
    with a recurrent incoming flow. illustrates the results with
    numerical examples. the method can be used for the analysis of
    real computerised information systems.
