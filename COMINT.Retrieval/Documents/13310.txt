electrical properties of titanium dioxide rectifiers
    results obtained are similar to those reported earlier by
    breckenridge and hosler of the conversion efficiency of a bi
    tio rectifier remained constant during operation for at and
    during most of the test at but decreased rapidly during
    operation at failure occurring after the spread of the
    rectification characteristics of rectifiers is presented
    graphically a well as the distribution of peak dynamic current
    voltage characteristics in specimens
