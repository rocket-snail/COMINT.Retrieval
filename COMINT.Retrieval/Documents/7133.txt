identification of mode in low frequency sweep ionospheric
    sounding and interference patterns between overlapping echoes
    the echo is received on a pair of crossed coplanar horizontal
    dipoles and split into its two circular components by means of
    a two channel receiver the resulting video signals are
    electrically subtracted and applied as brilliance modulation to
    a conventional c r tube where the echo is displayed as a light
    or dark trace depending on its sense of rotation the technique
    is convenient for observing interference fringes and these
    effects are discussed
