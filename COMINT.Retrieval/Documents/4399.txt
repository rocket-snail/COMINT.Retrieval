public libraries and literacy amongst children and
    adults. in the netherlands despite compulsory education for the
    whole population there are now some 100,000 to 400,000
    (semi-)illiterates. in dutch schools 2 methods of learning to
    read and write have been used, the traditional method of
    learning to recognise lists of simple but unrelated words and
    the functional method which was related to the pupil's
    environment and experience. whichever method is used, it is
    essential to develop the pupil's ability to read fluently and
    to motivate him to continue reading after leaving school. the
    dutch public library act of 1975 recognised the importance of
    library services for young people in abolishing library
    membership charges up to the age of 18. however, the act failed
    to recognise the need to provide special types of reading
    materials for people with reading difficulties.
