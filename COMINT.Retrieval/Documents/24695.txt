selenium rectifier instantaneous characteristics current
    voltage characteristics obtained by applying a rectified
    sinusoidal voltage to a cell in the reverse direction have been
    recorded a current in the forward direction flows during a
    large part of the cycle a convenient equivalent circuit to
    explain this result comprises nonlinear capacitance and
    nonlinear resistance in parallel both resistance and
    capacitance decrease with increasing reverse voltage and are
    relatively independent of the frequency of the supply voltage
    over a wide range
