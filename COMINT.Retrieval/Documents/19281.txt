what will happen to national library services?. the
    national network of public library cooperation and information
    exchange is now well established in finland. the central
    library for public libraries will become operational in 1981.
    the work for a network for scientific libraries has not been
    started. the 6 central libraries established so far cover only
    some sciences and no extra funding has been given for this new
    responsibility. in 1974 the council for scientific information
    gave the basic model for establishing a network for scientific
    libraries. this would include a national library, a centre for
    interlending, and central libraries for different sciences. no
    centre for interlending exists yet, and the responsibilities of
    the helsinki university library as a national library need
    clarification.
