the reduction of low frequency noise in feedback
    integrators a considerable improvement in signal noise ratio
    compared with that of a conventional direct coupled integrator
    is obtained either by using an error amplifier containing a
    single cr coupling or by applying phase correction to the
    output from a low accuracy direct coupled integrator
