on the variation of the f layer accompanying geomagnetic
    storms the universal time dependent and local time dependent
    parts of the variations of and during geomagnetic storms have
    been calculated from data for several widely separated stations
    the local time variations appear to be due to the s current
    associated with the storm no indication of a moving disturbance
    from the auroral zone was found
