low noise parametric amplifier the n ise temperature and
    pump power xsing a semiconductor diode can be accurately
    predicted from a measurement of the diode and circuit
    parameters the ultimate lower noise limit depends on the
    product of diode cut off frequency and the normalized
    capacitance swing
