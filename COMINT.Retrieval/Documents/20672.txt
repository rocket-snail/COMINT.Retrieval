nuclear magnetic resonance maser a detailed investigation
    of a two level weak field maser type self oscillator based on
    nuclear spin rotation in a circulating liquid under conditions
    of rapid adiabatic passage through resonance applications for
    magnetic field and relaxation time measurements are
    discussed
