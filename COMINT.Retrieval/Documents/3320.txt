the length of ionized meteor trails the length of the
    meteor ionization column is defined as the distance between the
    most widely separated points along the trail from which normal
    incidence radio reflections can be obtained using a radar
    system of prescribed characteristics a statistical study is
    made of the length distribution of trails based on measurements
    made at two observation stations a spaced km apart and
    operating with a cw output power of about on the mean trail
    length found was meteors up to the sixth magnitude were
    detected
