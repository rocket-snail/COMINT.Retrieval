stalking microcomputer software. when pontiac high
    school's media centre purchased a microcomputer, they
    encountered problems in locating suitable programs. a list of
    programs finally located is given with details of the
    manufacturers and notes on use. the attempt to obtain software
    packages on approval, in the same way as other audio-visual
    materials, was not totally successful but 28 programs out of
    the 37 requested were available for preview. suggests that the
    reasons for witholding approval may be associated with the
    newness of the educational market coupled with fears of
    copyright abuse.
