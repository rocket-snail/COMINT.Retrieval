information processing networks in international banking.
    during the past decade there has been increasing concern over
    the social, economic and political impacts of international
    computerised information networks. this study suggests that
    there are at least 3 levels of such networks, each with the
    potential for increasingly greater social or organisational
    impact. based on that categorisation, international banking was
    chosen as the focus for an attitude survey concerning the
    perceived effects among bankers of using international
    networks. results indicate that telex is much more important
    for daily international banking operations than computer
    networks, although within 6 years computer networks are
    expected to replace telex in importance.
