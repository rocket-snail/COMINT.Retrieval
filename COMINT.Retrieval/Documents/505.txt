a bibliographical reference service to readers as part of
    reading guidance. sets out to describe the educational function
    of bibliographical reference work, making clear those features
    which, by way of their active promotion of information,
    distinguish it from a purely passive question and answer form
    of service. the role of bibliographical reference work in the
    whole field of reading guidance is so important that research
    needs to be undertaken into not only its organisational and
    technological aspects, but also its content. only when
    bibliographical methods are employed in all processes of
    library work will a higher level of book promotion be
    achieved.
