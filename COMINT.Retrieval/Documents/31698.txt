time constants in the geomagnetic storm effect an
    estimate is made of the delay between formation of a ring
    current round the earth and the occurrence of a geomagnetic
    storm at ground level parker has estimated the delay as several
    months but by taking proper account of the fluidity of the
    medium and the presence of the main geomagnetic field the delay
    is found to be small enough to be consonant with the ring
    current theory of geomagnetic storms
