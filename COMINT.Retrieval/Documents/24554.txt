electrical high frequency separating filter networks
    frequency separating diplexer and notch diplexer networks are
    described two classes of frequency separating networks are
    distinguished networks with series tuned circuits in parallel
    and parallel tuned circuits in series parallel parallel and
    series series tuned circuit networks the former are of the
    frequency rejector type the latter of the frequency acceptor
    type the application of theory is shown in several numerical
    examples of design of transmitter hf separating filter networks
    the results are compared with the observed
    characteristics
