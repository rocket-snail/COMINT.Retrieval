a new method of synthesis of reactance networks since the
    chain matrix of a cascade combination of quadripoles is the
    product of the individual chain matrices and since synthesis of
    a complicated network by the insertion loss method involves
    obtaining a number of simple sections to be connected in
    cascade the chain matrix is chosen for this purpose a method of
    factorizing any relizable chain matrix into two such matrices
    of lower order is presented repeated factorizationsections
    simple enough to be synthesized the method involves only simple
    algebra and a new theorem concerning reactance and impedance
