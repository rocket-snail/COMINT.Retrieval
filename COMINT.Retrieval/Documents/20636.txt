band pass circuits with minimum number of coils part band
    pass filters with prescribed attenuation characteristic any
    band pass filter with the exception of the equalized
    characteristic impedance type can be constructed using a
    suitable combination of the basic filter sections described by
    transforming parts of the filter using the circuit equivalents
    given th number of circuit components can be reduced this is
    illustrated by a numerical example
