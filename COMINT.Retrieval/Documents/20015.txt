study of the dielectric in paper capacitors measurements
    were made of the loss angle of wet and dry paper at and of the
    permittivity of the impregnant and of the impregnated paper
    from these an equivalent circuit was derived for the capacitor
    which can be used in estimating the quality of the paper and
    desirable conditions of manufacture breakdown strength
    measurements were also made to determine the optimum applied
    voltage
