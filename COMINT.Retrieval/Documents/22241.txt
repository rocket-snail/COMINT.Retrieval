workplace libraries in east germany' mutual competition
    for the best loan statistics. after the 2nd world war, west
    germany continued as it left off in 1933, with factory
    libraries in the old patriarchal form and library policies with
    traditional bourgeois ideals. in east germany, however, a
    period of denazification and rebuilding of society in a
    socialist form followed the war. libraries received high
    priority in the anti-fascist propaganda campaign, with access
    to libraries in 96% of districts in 1957 compared to 40% in
    1947. a purge of library books was carried out on stalinist
    principles with some libraries losing up to 90% of their stock.
    however, the public library system expanded rapidly, but
    without deviation from the ideological line in book selection.
    a network of workplace libraries under the trade unions has
    also been developed in keeping with the importance attached to
    libraries for ideological education. the basis for these
    libraries is the maxim' all workers must read. th e libraries
    must reach a certain norm in lending figures and control with
    the material borrowed is possible. the workplace libraries, far
    from being an expression of working class democracy, are an
    ideological instrument of the trade union leadership directed
    at the working class.
