library science congresses' evaluation and perspectives.
    report on the aims and activities of the 10th brazilian library
    science and documentation congress, comparing the careful
    structure implemented here with the haphazard nature of
    previous meetings. the account analyses the problems previously
    encountered in conference organisation, resulting in loss of
    principle focus and dissipation of interest. in contrast this
    congress was based on a dominant central theme, sub-themes were
    kept strictly relevant, and both official and unofficial papers
    carefully monitored. details are given of procedures and
    criteria for selecting topics and papers. the sessions,
    discussion groups and workshops were similarly controlled, to
    achieve a session in which interest and purpose were maintained
    throughout. suggests further ways of developing this kind of
    congress organisation and emphasises its benefits to the
    profession as a whole and individual participants.
