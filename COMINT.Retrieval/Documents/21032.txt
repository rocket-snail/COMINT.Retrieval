situation in countries of continental europe.
    contribution to a thematic issue on public lending right (plr).
    outlines the plr schemes operating in denmark, norway, sweden,
    finland, iceland, the netherlands, and west germany. attempts
    to establish a joint plr scheme in scandinavia, or at least
    reciprocal bilateral agreements, have been unsuccessful.
    denmark, the netherlands, and west germany are facing the
    problem of maintaining different schemes within the european
    economic community (eec). of these 3, only west germany has a
    plr scheme which is within its copyright laws and which does
    not operate for the benefit of its own citizens. the eec
    prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality; the effect
    of this on plr is being debated.
