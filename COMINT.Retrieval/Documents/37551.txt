semiconductor amplifiers and generators with carriers
    having negative effective mass it is not possible to produce
    states with negative losses in a semiconductor by means of a
    constant electric field it is necessary to have a state with
    negative losses in a semiconductor by means of a constant
    electric field it is necessary to have a state with negative
    temperature as achieved in molecular generators or using pulsed
    excitation by a electric field
