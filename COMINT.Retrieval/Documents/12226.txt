thermal theories of the high intensity components of
    solar radio frequency radiation thermal theories of the origin
    of enhanced rf radiation from regions which occasionally attain
    brightness temperatures of deg k or more are discussed none of
    the theories is found capable of explaining the available
    observational data it is concluded that all three radiation
    components are generated by the ordered nonthermal motion of
    electrons
