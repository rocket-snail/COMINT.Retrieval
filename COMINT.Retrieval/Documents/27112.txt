quantum theory of magnetostriction of ferromagnetic
    single crystals theory is developed for crystals with hexagonal
    or cubic symmetry at low temperatures results indicate that
    magnetostriction is connected with the magnetic interaction of
    electrons and also give the temperature dependence of
    magnetostriction constants in the case investigated
