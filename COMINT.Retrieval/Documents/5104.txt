thermal structures in the lowest layers of the atmosphere
    temperature variations recorded simultaneously at heights of
    and were examined statistically correlation between a pair of
    such records was greatest at a time displacement depending on
    wind speed difference between the two heights the evidence
    suggests organized thermal structures of great vertical
    extent
