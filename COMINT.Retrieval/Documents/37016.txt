a study of noon f ionization in relation to geomagnetic
    coordinates earlier work of bhar of has been extended to cover
    data collected between and an analysis of which indicates that
    for constant the noon ionization varies with magnetic dip and
    geomagnetic latitude the shape of the curve is related to the
    sunspot cycle and shows two maxima spaced asymmetrically on
    each side of the geomagnetic equator
