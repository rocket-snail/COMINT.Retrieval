damping of the natural electromagnetic oscillations of
    the system earth air ionosphere continuation of work noted in
    above an approximate formula is derived for the damping of the
    lowest frequency oscillations from which the effective height
    of the air layer and the effective conductivity of the
    ionosphere can be determined
