minimum inductor or capacitor filters known methods are
    surveyed and some new methods developed for designing
    equivalent filter networks having fewer inductors or capacitors
    than a given network the particular transformation appropriate
    in a given case depends on whether the given filter is an image
    parameter type which can be split into separate m derived
    sections or is of a more general character the methods
    presented are based on the values of the network elements
    without reference to impedance frequency functions of the
    network as a whole two practical examples of application of the
    methods to band pass filters are treated in detail
