reflection of a transient electromagnetic wave at a
    conducting surface a treatment of oblique incidence reflection
    from the plane interface of a dissipative medium the inversion
    of the laplace transforms can only be carried out in closed
    form in special cases series solutions are developed for the
    general case and numerical results are presented graphically a
    possible application of the results to the case of a lightning
    discharge waveform and reflection from a sharply bounded
    ionosphere is noted
