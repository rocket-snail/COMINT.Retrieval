maser noise considerations a discussion of the effect of
    the saturation rf field on the noise figure of a three level
    maser for the conditions considered the effect is small the
    spontaneous emission equivalent temperature for a free electron
    vacuum tube amplifier is one half that of a maser in principle
    more general quantum mechanical amplifiers can be constructed
    which will not have spontaneous emission noise
