a sensitive pulse trigger circuit with a stable threshold
    a pulse amplitude discriminator for positive or negative pulses
    is described in which the sensitivity is independent of contact
    potential variations in the valves with a threshold of
    stability is within the simplified circuit comprises two
    triodes passing steady currents and a clamping diode operated
    under retarding field conditions the minimum effective pulse
    width is about the same as that for conventional discriminators
    performance figures substantiate theoretical calculations of
    sensitivity
