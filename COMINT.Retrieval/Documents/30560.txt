rapid modulation of microwaves on a coaxial line with the
    aid of ferrites a signal on a coaxial cable has been modulated
    to a depth of at resonance absorption in a magnetized ferrite
    tube threaded on the core of the cable is varied by a coil
    round the tube the modulating field is chosen to operate about
    a mean value on one flank of the resonance curve
