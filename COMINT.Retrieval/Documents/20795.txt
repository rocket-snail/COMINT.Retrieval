libraries in provincial high schools should become
    community libraries. in papua new guinea the majority of the
    population now is being educated, and community information
    centres, such as libraries, are needed to provide the
    information which people require to keep up with day-to-day
    events. such a centre should also provide information to help
    people to improve their daily life. since the country does not
    have enough libraries, more use should be made of existing
    libraries, and most of the country's libraries are in
    provincial high schools, which could feasibly extend their
    services to the general public. cites advantages and
    disadvantages of such a development, concluding that such a
    move would ultimately lead to the development of more efficient
    library services in papua new guinea.
