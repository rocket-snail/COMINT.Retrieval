typewritten texts and typewriting' some points arising
    from a discussion on formulating a bibliological approach. a
    report of a forum held in oct 80 by the french institute for
    the study of the book, sponsored by the ministry of education,
    to consider the implications of general use of typewriters for
    teaching in commercial institutions and for informatics; and
    the economic, social and cultural consequences worldwide,
    present and future. the development of typewriters from their
    invention up to the present is traced, in relation to the
    consequences in the organisation and administration of office
    work and personnel deployment. the introduction of
    sophisticated machines which dispense with traditional
    operators is considered and the potential consequences for
    publishing methods and information communication techniques
    surveyed. in conclusion, it is debated whether bibliology might
    become outmoded in the near future. an appendix lists the
    papers presented at the forum.
