electron energy distribution measurements in gas
    discharges accuracy of the distribution determination using the
    method of druyvestyn is improved by differentiating the
    langmuir probe signal and filtering mains frequency noise from
    the output the second differential coefficient is obtained by
    graphical differentiation
