general properties of electromagnetic amplifiers the
    relations between gain bandwidth or time constant and power
    rating are discussed results to be expected from use of
    feedback are e amined the amplifiers considered include
    thermionic valve magnetic and rotating machine types devices
    for improving the shape of the pass band normally involve delay
    distributed amplifiers permit improvement of the gain bandwidth
    parameter but not of the gain time constant ratio
