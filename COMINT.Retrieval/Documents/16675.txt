improved lock in amplifier a stable sinusoidal voltage
    drives a square wave generator whose output is applied to the
    anodes of a pair of i diodes in phase opposition the signal is
    applied to the anodes of a pair of diodes in phase opposition
    the signal is applied to the diode cathodes in equal phase the
    dc output voltage developed between the two cathodes is
    directly proportional to the signal and is largely independent
    of the input noise level the value of the stable voltage and
    the valve parameters
