an analysis of the methods used to convey information on
    complex biochemical structures, by representations and coding
    systems. (msc thesis.) representations are vital for the
    communication of protein structural information. these
    representations can be classified according to biochemical
    structure, and vary in complexity and method of production.
    many types of representation are necessary to fully document a
    protein structure. investigates the primary literature of
    protein structure, and the methods used by biochemical and
    chemical data bases in handling protein structures. explores
    aspects of nomenclature of proteins and coding systems for
    proteins, and the suitability of noerr structures for storing
    biochemical structure.
