on the great solar flare which started at february as the
    likely source of geomagnetic storm february it is shown that
    there is a high probability that the flare caused the magnetic
    storm experimental evidence is given supporting a connection
    between the early part of a solar noise burst and a short wave
    fade out and between the late part and magnetic storm
    occurrence
