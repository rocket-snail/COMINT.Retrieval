automation in austrian libraries. paper presented at the
    1st austrian-soviet seminar on the role of libraries in a
    country's socio-economic and cultural life, held at the lenin
    state library, 20-22 mar 79. describes an automated library
    system adopted by the graz university library, selected to
    carry out an automation project before the introduction of
    computerisation in other austrian research libraries
    administered by the federal ministry of science and research.
    the system comprises a computerised issue system based on the
    light pen and on-line cataloguing and searching. when the
    system becomes fully operational throughout all libraries
    concerned, the network will be divided by regions into smaller
    units and each library will have its minicomputer. user
    services will be improved by the possibility of information
    retrieval through the large international data bases.
