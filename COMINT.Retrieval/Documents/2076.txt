library effectiveness in meeting information consumer's
    needs. presents the findings of an investigation into library
    effectiveness in terms of meeting citizens' information needs.
    residents from 2,400 randomly-selected households in the new
    england states of the usa participated in 15-minute telephone
    interviews, july-oct 79. it appears that they infrequently
    consult libraries as an information resource in work or
    non-work situations. of the 17% using libraries, the majority
    (11%) do not have strong feelings about the library as an
    information provider. to become more effective competitors with
    other information providers, libraries must publicise resources
    and services more effectively, improve document delivery
    capability, and identify and reduce barriers encountered by the
    citizen when attempting to gain access to information.
