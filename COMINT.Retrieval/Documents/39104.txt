a rapid method of obtaining accurate virtual heights from
    an ionogram the variation of apparent vertical height with the
    amplitude of the reflected signal depends on constants of the
    equipment these constants are used to construct a transparent
    slider which corrects for this variation and enables virtual
    heights to be obtained accurately
