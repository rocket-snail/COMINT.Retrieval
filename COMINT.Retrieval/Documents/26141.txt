ground conductivity determinations at low radio
    frequencies by an analysis of the spheric signatures of
    thunderstorms the experimental and analytical techniques are
    described a detailed comparison of predicted and experimentally
    observed waveforms indicates that the effective conductivity
    can be determined to a precision of one or two significant
    figures application of the techniques for evaluating the
    reflection and transmission properties of the lower ionosphere
    is suggested
