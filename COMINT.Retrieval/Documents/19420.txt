school library staff on a school trip. 2 library staff
    members accompanied a class of 14-year olds and their teachers
    from a kassel comprehensive school on a holiday trip to sylt.
    the library staff took with them about 140 books on games,
    modelling, the identification of sea creatures and some
    children's fiction. every evening the children and teachers
    used these books as a complement to the day's activities. as a
    result the library staff developed close contact with some
    teachers and pupils who had hitherto been seen only rarely in
    the library. some of these children who had tended to misbehave
    in the school library were shown to better advantage in the
    holiday situation. story sessions were also organised and were
    received enthusiastically, even by children who had previously
    shown little interest in literature.
