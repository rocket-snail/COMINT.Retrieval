computer-aided selection of compounds for antitumor
    screening' validation of a statistical-heuristic method. recent
    work helped confirm the validity of a previously published
    statistical-heuristic method for selecting compounds to be
    processed in the national cancer institute (nci) mouse tumour
    prescreen. one study involved about 35,000 compounds which
    satisfied certain biological and chemical criteria. these
    compounds, taken from the nci collection, were ranked according
    to predicted probability of activity. the results showed 34% of
    the active compounds in the top 10% of the ranking. in a second
    study the predictive ability of a chemist and the computer were
    compared by having each rate almost 1,000 previously unselected
    compounds for activity. the results were about equal with
    respect to the yield of biologically active compounds, though
    their selection agreement was fairly low.
