the equatorial f region of the ionosphere critical
    frequencies in the f region at panama and chimbote are
    negatively correlated in the afternoon this phenomenon together
    with the diurnal variation in height thickness and electron
    density of the equatorial f region is consistent with the
    theory of ionization transportation from the equator to the
    subtromics suggested by martyn
