coupled cavity travelling wave parametric amplifiers part
    experiments gain bandwidth products of with a bandwidth have
    been obtained at s band frequencies using commercially
    available diodes noise temperatures of have been measured
    methods for achieving short circuit stability are investigated
    these n include the use of ferrite loaded coupling irises and
    of upper frequency pass bands
