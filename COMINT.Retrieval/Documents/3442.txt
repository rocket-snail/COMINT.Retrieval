the electric field of conductors arranged parallel to
    conducting planes intersecting at a given angle convenient
    formulae are obtained by considering the field as the resultant
    of those due to the multiple reflections of the conductor in
    the intersecting planes these formulae are shown to agree with
    those derived by the method of conformal transformation
