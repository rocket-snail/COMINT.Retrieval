study of cosmic rays and terrestrial corpuscular
    radiation by cosmic rocket a preliminary examination of data
    obtained by the cosmic rocket at distances between and from the
    centre of the earth graphs show that a maximum intensity of
    terrestrial corpuscular radiation is found at a distance of and
    that at this intensity falls to zero the density of cosmic rays
    was found by geiger counter to be particles cm sec and by
    scintillation counter to be particles cm sec
