towards an alternative regional approach to libraries. in
    the netherlands a change in government policy towards the
    provision of regional library services is now becoming
    apparent. in the government's view the increasing availability
    of on-line information retrieval services will necessitate the
    creation of a network of well-stocked libraries in each region.
    in order to finance such a policy whilst local authorities are
    suffering severe economic restraints, the government has
    suggested that less attention should be given to the
    recreational function of public libraries. in addition,
    research by the bibliotheekraad (library advisory council) into
    interlibrary lending in the netherlands has shown that there is
    insufficient cooperation on acquisition policies amongst the
    libraries of each region. in order to bring libraries together
    in closer cooperation it will be necessary to overcome the
    resistance of individual librarians and to change the present
    law relating to public libraries.
