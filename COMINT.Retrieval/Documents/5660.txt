potential distribution between two plane emitting
    electrodes part thermionic engines all potential distributions
    can be represented by a two parameter family of curves the
    parameters depending on the electrode temperatures potentials
    and work functions the computed results show clearly th
    relative influence of these quantities on the potential minimum
    between the electrodes
