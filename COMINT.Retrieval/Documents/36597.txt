the radio refractive index gradient over the british
    isles airborne microwave refractometer measurements made in the
    british isles confirm that the quantity varies exponentially
    with height the variations in the parameters are less than
    those in the usa there is a high correlation between the
    surface value of and the average decrease in the refractive
    index in the first kilometre of altitude
