coherent scattering and radiation of electromagnetic
    waves by plasma in an inhomogeneous magnetic field the
    propagation of quasi plane waves in a waveguide filled with
    plasma in a longitudinal magnetic field and the radiation in an
    electron plasma of a bunch which travels through a spatially
    periodic axially symmetric magnetic field are discussed the
    plasma tends to focus the bunches and a longitudinal focusing
    effect results from the attraction between the induced currents
    flowing in the same direction
