statistical determination of bound volume journal
    holdings in a science library. discusses a method for the
    determination of the number of bound journal volumes in a
    science library using a sampling technique. the method allows
    the calculation of the extent of journal runs for both current
    and non-current titles. a comparison of the total number of
    volumes arrived at using the current study methodology and
    another independent study shows agreement within 5%. further
    incidental information gathered during the course of the study
    provides information on other characteristics of the
    collection.
