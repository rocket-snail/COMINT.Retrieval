electromagnetic field of a dipole source above a grounded
    dielectric slab a theoretical investigation using the method of
    integral transforms solutions in integral form are evaluated
    asymptotically by the saddle point method the distant field is
    found to be the resultant of a spherical space wave and a
    cylindrical surface wave calculated radiation patterns for some
    particular cases with and without the dielectric slab are
    presented
