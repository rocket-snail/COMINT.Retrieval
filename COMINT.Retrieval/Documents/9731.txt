a new concept for the design of a flexible office system.
    presents office automation systems as an application of
    microprocessor based systems. the small size, low cost, and
    reasonably high power of these systems enabled their use in
    automating some office tasks. presents a general description of
    a typical microprocessor based office automation system, then
    discusses the problems arising in the design, implementation,
    and use of such systems. proposes a scheme for partitioning and
    modularising the hardware and software of the system, taking
    into consideration the solution of some problems of
    compatibility, portability and system extensibility. the
    proposed system can be used as a universal basic core on which
    one can easily build larger word processing systems. the user
    can, by himself, extend his system by using the same word
    processing language he uses everyday because of its special
    properties presented here. the system is also simply
    reconfigurable at the will of the user to exactly fi t his
    needs at any time.
