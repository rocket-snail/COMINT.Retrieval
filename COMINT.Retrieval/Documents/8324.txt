children, libraries and comics in mexico. describes a
    visit to mexico and the us financed benjamin franklin library
    in guadelajara briefly. the children's library attached to the
    'centro social morelos' in aguascalientes suffers from lack of
    space and material, and the unqualified librarian's main duty
    is to keep order. few public libraries lend books. the stream
    of pulp magazines and comics for adults and children is now
    being countered by the state, who publishes material in similar
    style, but better content. the library in san cristobal
    receives money for staff salaries but none for books. like
    other libraries, biblioteca de mexico is used mainly by
    students. the public library service came on a more organised
    footing in 1978, and as no school libraries exist, creation of
    children's sections is receiving priority. there is great
    demand for the librarians trained at the 6 universities but
    many are attracted into private firms. continuity of library
    planning is hampered by the changes of central administration
    every 6 years.
