waves in a conducting sheet situated in a strong magnetic
    field the hydromagnetic approximation is applied to the
    elementary linear theory of transverse waves in a thin uniform
    plane conducting sheet in which the inertia is provided by the
    sheet and the restoring forces by strong vacuum magnetic fields
    on either side of the sheet the dispersion relation and damping
    are obtained the waves should be observable in the
    laboratory
