wide band radio interferometer the use of a wide band
    amplifier with the frequency characteristic given in
    conjunction with an aerial system consisting of two or four
    aerials in line or aerials arranged symmetrically in a square
    results in very high resolution in the example quoted radio
    sources separated by an angle of ca be resolved the theory of
    the interferometer is given and the general form of the
    directional characteristic is shown
