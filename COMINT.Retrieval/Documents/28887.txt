harmonic and intermodulation distortion in power law
    devices explicit expressions are derived for the
    intermodulation components produced when two sinusoidal
    voltages are applied simultaneously to a device such as a diode
    whose transfer characteristic can be represented by a simple
    power law formula results of practical importance in
    intermodulation distortion testing are presented
    graphically
