radio observations of the planet jupiter details are
    given of observations outlined previously together with
    unpublished information from earlier observations in june
    correlation of the observations with rotation polarization and
    frequency characteristics is discussed most of the radio noise
    bursts were strongly circularly polarized and the spectrum does
    not appear to be continuous over the frequencies observed
    critical reflections by an ionosphere around jupiter are
    discounted
