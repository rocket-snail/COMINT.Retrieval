the vector wave function solution of the diffraction of
    electromagnetic waves by circular disks and apertures part
    oblate spheroidal vector wave functions part the diffraction
    problems the vector wave functions considered are the
    solenoidal solutions of the vector helmholtz equation oblate
    spheroidal vector wave functions are defined and the expansions
    for plane polarized waves in terms of them are obtained a
    unique solution is obtained for the diffraction by an
    infinitely thin perfectly conducting circular disk and by a
    plane conducting screen two separate groups of these functions
    are combined to fulfil the condition at the rims of the
    aperture and disk using the spheroidal coordinate system
