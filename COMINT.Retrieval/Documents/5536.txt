noise of resistors and resistor combinations without and
    with load noise due to current flow in carbon film type
    resistors is particularly considered the increase over thermal
    noise is controlled by a factor which depends on loading film
    dimensions and the construction of the resistor from this a
    formula is derived which contains a constant dependent on film
    material
