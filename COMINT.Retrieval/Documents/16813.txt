anomalous winter absorption of radio waves measurements
    made at cambridge england of the absorption of cosmic radio
    noise on a frequency of show that the average midday absorption
    in winter is about twice as great as in summer an attempt is
    made to relate this abnormality to the winter anomaly in
    absorption of reflected waves if certain assumptions are made
    it can be shown that on the majority of days in winter the
    absorbing electrons are largely concentrated at a height of
    about km
