molecular amplifier and generator for submillimetre waves
    the rotational transitions of nh molecules lie in the
    wavelength region below mm an amplifier can be constructed
    using a device in which radiation from one horn crosses a
    number of molecular beams and falls on a second horn the
    maximum power obtainable is about
