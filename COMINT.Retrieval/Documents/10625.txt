information and communication technology: substitute or
    support for the human components?. discussion about or
    application of new technology is hindered by people's attitudes
    to it, ranging from the over-enthusiastic to the profoundly
    suspicious. men seem to have been replaced by computers, so the
    human factor in technology is neglected. data bases must,
    however, be oriented towards man's needs, and dialogue systems
    are meant for machines and men; human intermediaries between
    machines and users will be needed for a long time. all
    scientists search their own stock of information before using
    other sources; at present there is no connection between or
    analysis of these small, informal stocks. connection of large
    retrieval systems with individual information systems would
    show respect for the human components. the informal human
    exchange of opinion and the human brain's ability to create
    cross-connections in information are still essential.
