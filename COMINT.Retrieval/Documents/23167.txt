charging for online retrieval services. attempts to set
    out the dilemma many librarians and information officers find
    themselves in, as to whether on-line services should be paid
    for by the end-user, or seen as a charge upon the library. in
    the many instances where the user has to pay, very many
    variations exist in terms of which elements of the total cost
    are charged back. examples are given. the paper stresses the
    desirability of formulating some rational scheme for bringing
    charging policies into line, offers no solutions, but invites
    cooperative discussion of the situation.
