some magnetic properties of metals part diamagnetic
    resonance em radiation incident on a large system of electrons
    moving in a constant magnetic field h in a metal is strongly
    absorbed near a frequency where m is the effective mass the
    resonance absorption is of the same order of magnitude as the
    absorption due to skin effect part of
