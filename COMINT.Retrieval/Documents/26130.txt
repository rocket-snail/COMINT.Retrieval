diffraction of electromagnetic waves by smooth obstacles
    for grazing angles the diffraction of electromagnetic waves by
    a convex cylindrical suface is considered attention is confined
    primarily to the region near the lightshadow boundary the
    complex integral representation for the field is utilized to
    obtain a correction to the kirchhoff theory numerical results
    are presented which illustrate the influence of surface
    curvature and polarization on the diffraction pattern good
    agreement with the experimental results of bachynski neugebauer
    is obtained the effect of finite conductivity is also
    considered
