a fixed gas dielectric capacitor of high stability
    factors contributing to instability of capaced the position of
    the maximum is determined composed for parallel plate types
    suitable for use under laboratory conditions a capacitor
    embodying these principles is described the performance figures
    indicate that a considerable gain in stability can be achieved
    without serious complication in design
