some statistical results on the phenomena associated with
    ionospheric storms data covering the years on height of maximum
    ionization o of the f layer and absorption in lower layers were
    analysed to determine the probability that a particular day
    will be a storm day for a given set of solar conditions a day
    is considered to b be a storm day if the mean variation of
    these three parameters studied separately in relation to the
    effects of sunspots m regions and solar flares is such as would
    cause a fall in muf or a rise in luf positive results were
    obtained only for the parameter f except for storms associated
    with m regions at sunspot minimum the probability that a given
    day will be a storm day does not exceed for the first day of a
    storm but many reach on subsequent days it is concluded that
    only during the sunspot minimum period can ionospheric storms
    be forecast on solar data alone
