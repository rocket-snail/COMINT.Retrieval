travelling disturbances in the ionosphere diurnal
    variation of direction since the publication of previous papers
    of observations of greater accuracy and extending over a
    greater part of the day have provided definite evidence of
    diurnal variation in the direction of horizontal movement this
    is most marked in the month of june a graph is given which
    shows the median values of all directions observed for each
    hourly interval for all days of june in and a similar trend is
    noted in all three years the direction of movement changing
    from about at to at recent night observations suggest that
    there is consistently an e component of movement at night in
    contrast with the consistent we component in the daytime
