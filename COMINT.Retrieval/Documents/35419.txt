the gain of travelling wave ferromagnetic amplifiers the
    gain of an amplifier using a circular waveguide and axial
    ferrite rod of small cross section is determined by a general
    perturbation method methods for overcoming the low efficiency
    are discussed and other possible waveguide configurations and
    practical aspects of construction are described
