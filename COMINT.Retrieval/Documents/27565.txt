lending music in tampere. the tampere city library
    started an experimental music lending service in 1975. 3 years
    later the service was established permanently. the music
    working group of the library reports that a record lasts about
    40-50 loans and returned records are generally in good
    condition. between 1975-79 about 81,000 records were loaned.
    the experiences from the services are only positive. there are
    about 4,000 records in stock. they are loaned for 7 weeks. the
    library also has listening facilities.
