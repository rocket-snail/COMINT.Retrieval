the importance of cooperation for the utilisation of
    pharmaceutical literature. hungarian non-industrial
    pharmaceutical institutions are not provided with special
    literature. their libraries and book collections belong to the
    medical library network, but they are the 'stepchildren' of the
    network, and do not utilise advantages to be expected from
    cooperation. conditions in budapest are more favourable than
    elsewhere in hungary, as pharmacists can visit the network
    centres, the hungarian technical library and the library of the
    hungarian academy of sciences. elsewhere, pharmacists can only
    rely on a small amount of available literature. recommends
    improvements in acquisitions, and interlibrary loans through
    the development of library cooperation, and discusses a data
    bank established by the hungarian national institute of
    pharmaceutics, which holds information on foreign drug
    compounds, their producers, indications and counterindications,
    side-effects, and possible hungarian equivalents.
