spurious frequency modulation in signal generators the
    chief cause of fm in an am circuit is the variation of valve
    input capacitance with modulation methods of reducing this
    effect are examined two circuits effective in reducing fm at
    vhf are described an untuned class a amplifier with grid
    modulation a voltage dividing network containing a crystal
    diode suitably biased to act as resistance
