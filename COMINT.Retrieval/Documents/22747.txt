horizontal movements of aurora the drift of auroral forms
    has been measured at three stations in canada south of the
    auroral zone no evidence is found of a motion due to the earths
    rotation relative to a fixed point in space the distribution
    and magnitude of the drift speeds parallel and normal to the
    geomagnetic meridians are similar to those found for
    ionospheric drifts the drifts speeds increase with geomagnetic
    activity particularly in an ew direction
