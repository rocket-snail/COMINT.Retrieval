solar corona and geomagnetism both coronal activity and
    geomagnetic disturbance vary directly with general solar
    activity except at the period of sunspot minimum when
    correlation between the two is negative geomagnetic disturbance
    is greatest when the earth is in the radial line of an active
    coronal centre an active centre appears to have a shielding
    effect on the outflow of corpuscles from the undisturbed solar
    areas
