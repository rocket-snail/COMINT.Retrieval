the library for talking books and braille. the library
    for talking books and braille (tpb) was established on 1 jan 80
    when the state took over the library activities of the society
    for the blind. the 1st library for the blind had begun in 1892,
    and with the arrival of tapes the society began lending talking
    books in 1955, now as cassettes the dominant medium. from the
    start the books were available in the public libraries. the
    books are sold at cost price by the library service to the
    public libraries. the provision was the subject of several
    reports, above all the handicap commission's report culture for
    all, 1976. direct loans to individuals from tpb are falling,
    and the library's role as centre for loans of deposit
    collections is growing. the library, which is led by 7 state
    appointees, has units for production, lending, educational
    material, development and information.
