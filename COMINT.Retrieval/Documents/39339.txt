titanium dioxide rectifiers a detailed account of work
    carried out up to the present on the to film rectifiers
    previously noted of a feature of great practical importance is
    the improvement in performance with increase of temperature for
    a particular steam treated sample the forward current increased
    while the backward current decreased slightly as the
    temperature was increased up to heating to however causes
    irreversible damage differences of characteristics observed
    with different counter electrode metals are discussed a marked
    change of properties being noted when zn was used further
    investigations are in progress
