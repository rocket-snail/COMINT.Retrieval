densities and temperatures of the upper atmosphere
    inferred from satellite observations the atmospheric density
    between and km altitude appears to be appreciably higher than
    that derived from rocket data the temperature in this region
    must therefore be higher than that given by present model
    atmospheres the density is still below that derived from meteor
    data
