starting of an electrical gas discharge in a uniform
    alternating field in the sub critical range when the half
    period of the alternating field is greater than the duration of
    an ionization step the number of ionization steps in a half
    period varies with frequency and with field strength over this
    range the breakdown voltage frequency characteristic is
    positive but beyond a certain value of frequency it becomes
    negative later undergoing a further inflection so that at a
    frequency of it is again positive comprehensive experimental
    results illustrating these phases and the influences of
    pressure and electrode separation on them are presented
