the theory of electronic conduction in polar
    semiconductors the present problem has been considered before
    by several authors but many of the results which have been
    given are either incorrect within certain limits by solving the
    boltzmann equation for the velocity distribution function of
    the conduction electrons in a crystal in which the scattering
    is due to the polarization waves of the lattice exact
    expressions are obtained for the electrical conductivity and
    the thermoelectric power in the form of ratios of infinite
    determinants simple approximate solutions are derived and are
    used in the discussion of the dependence of conduction
    phenomena upon the temperature and upon the degree of
    degeneracy of the electron gas
