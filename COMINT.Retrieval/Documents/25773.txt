the machine aided translator. paper presented at the 54th
    aslib annual conference, oxford university, uk, 22-25 sept 81.
    modern aids to translation such as word processors,
    telecopiers, dictation equipment and optical character readers
    are examined. the translation process is broken down with
    examples, to establish which components can benefit from
    equipment available at moderate cost. production time for
    supported and solitary translators is compared to establish
    possible time saving areas. manual tasks undertaken by
    translator or secretary gain most from mechanisation but
    information search is also an important area for
    savings.
