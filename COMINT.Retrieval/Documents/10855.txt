microwave determination of plasma density profiles a
    method for the rapid determination of the average electron
    density and of the spatial electron density distribution in
    plasmas is presented the technique employed permits time
    resolved measurements over a wide range of electron densities
    introducing little or no perturbation into the gaseous
    discharge
