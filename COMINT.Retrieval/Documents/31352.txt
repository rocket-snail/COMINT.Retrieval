radio echoes observed during aurorae and geomagnetic
    storms using and waves simultaneously observations made at
    kjeller in and at tromsoe during early are reported echoes are
    only received when the aerial is directed towards the north the
    echo amplitude has a maximum value when the aerial is directed
    horizontally and decreases rapidly with increased elevation of
    the aerial the results indicate that there is no correlation
    between the position of visible aurorae and echo range but that
    there is a correlation between the occurrence of high e layer
    critical frequency and the reception of echoes during
    geomagnetic storms echoes on are observed only during the more
    severe phases scattering from the ground or sea reflected back
    vis an intense e layer is advanced in explanation of the
    observations
