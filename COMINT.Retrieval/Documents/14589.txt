optimum noise performance of linear amplifiers a single
    quantitative measure of amplifier spot noise performance is
    established which removes difficulties associated with the
    effect of feedback on the noise figure as it is a function only
    of the amplifier noise and circuit parameters it determines the
    lowest noise figure obtainable at high gain with a given
    amplifier used alone or passively connected to other amplifiers
    of the same and it provides an index of the absolute quality of
    noise performance
