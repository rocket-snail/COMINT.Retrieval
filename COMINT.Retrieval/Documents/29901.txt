lotka's law and library literature. the applicability of
    lotka's law to library science literature was tested by
    collecting authorship data from 2library literature1 (1978
    cumulated annual volume) and by crediting works of multiple
    authorship to only the first-named author. the data was found
    to conform to an inverse cube law more closely than an inverse
    square law (i.e. lotka's law).
