the wave forms of the electric field in atmospherics
    recorded simultaneously by two distant stations electric field
    variations were recorded at two stations one near uppsala the
    other at fotevik at the south western tip of sweden during
    september and the variations were correlated with thunderstorms
    which occurred at distances between and from uppsala in pre
    discharge atmospherics a quasi periodic variation was observed
    which corresponded most frequently to a wavelength of km the
    waveforms of the main discharges varied greatly with distance
    often in q a quasi periodic manner a unipolar form was also
    observed the mean waveform obtained from several hundreds of
    oscillograms shows five pulses reflected from the ionosphere in
    addition to the ground pulse waveform changes with distance
    travelled can only be calculated by making large
    simplifications numerous oscillograms are reproduced and
    discussed
