performance measurement and information arrangement.
    describes an attempt by aslib to develop a checklist for the
    evaluation of information services covering current awareness
    services, information retrieval services, document delivery and
    other miscellaneous evaluation activities. there was little
    support from practitioners for the development of guidelines
    relating to specific items in the checklist but choosing
    between an in-house data base and reliance on external supplies
    was seen as an issue of general significance. suggests the need
    for a 'user-friendly' package bringing together the best of the
    literature on performance measurement to encourage its
    widespread adoption.
