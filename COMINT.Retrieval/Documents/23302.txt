the user in librarianship curricula. extract from a
    postgraduate dissertation presented at ufmg library school,
    brazil. within the discipline of librarianship, user studies
    are an important research topic, but there is little systematic
    study of users in librarianship curricula. to establish how
    this important subject area should be treated in training
    programmes, an analysis was made of the literature dealing with
    users, to establish a theoretical basis for teaching purposes.
    results showed that the primary focus was on user behaviour in
    relation to social and cultural factors; needs and motivations;
    and interaction and communication in the library situation.
    accordingly, an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on, for
    example, psychology, anthropology and sociology, should be
    adopted.
