ferrite microwave detector it is shown theoretically that
    second order terms in one component of the magnetization of a
    ferrite under the action of a rf field may be used to produce
    magnetostriction in the ferrite and so to detect an am
    microwave signal an experimental technique is described in
    which the detector consists of a long thin ferrite rod in a
    waveguide magnetostriction vibrations are observed by means of
    a polarized ceramic rod bonded to the ferrite the qualitative
    results agree with theory and factors which are expected to
    improve performance are discussed
