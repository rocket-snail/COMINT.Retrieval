    glagolitic characters' basic theory and methodology. there has
    been a growing demand for a complete catalogue of cyrillic and

    the 1st volume of a complete catalogue was published by the
    lenin library. the 2description of old printed works in
    cyrillic characters1 is in many ways a trial edition. the
    methodology used presents a chronological catalogue of the old
    printed works with short bibliographical descriptions, details
    of all known copies and their whereabouts. a 2nd type of
    publication is being prepared simultaneously' the description
    of old cyrillic (eventually also glagolitic) characters
    (printed works) from particular printers. contributions towards
    the work of cataloguing the material are coming from libraries
    of all the slavic nations and from scholars of the subject
    throughout the world.
