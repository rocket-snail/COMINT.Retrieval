model experiments on aurorae and magnetic storms
    experiments on a magnetized sphere of were performed to check
    alfvens theory above although a proper scaling down is not
    possible some confirmation of the theory was obtained in
    particular the space charge accumulated in the discharge region
    discharges along the lines of magnetic force photographs of the
    discharge patterns produced at various electric and magnetic
    field strengths are shown and discussed
