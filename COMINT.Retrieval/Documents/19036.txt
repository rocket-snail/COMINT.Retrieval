leadership by nonadministrators in academic libraries.
    leadership by those not in positions of authority in libraries
    has usually been discussed in terms of participation in
    management. a number of other models are given' participation
    and feedback models, including the evaluation of superiors;
    models of confrontation and risk taking, including action to
    overcome mismanagement and assertion of employees' rights; and
    models for change agents, including use of staff organisations,
    informal action networks, and resource exchange networks. the
    theory is that a 'servant leadership' by lower and middle level
    staff may promote service by libraries and also increase
    attention to the importance of the work to the staff
    themselves. the action models should be tested and related to a
    career-stage model which identifies power and influence by
    those who are not managers.
