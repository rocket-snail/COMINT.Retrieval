exact nonlinear plasma oscillations a solution is given
    for the problem of a one dimensional stationary nonlinear
    electrostatic wave in a plasma free from inter particle
    collisions in the limiting case of small amplitude waves the
    linearized theory can still be applied by using singular first
    order distribution functions
