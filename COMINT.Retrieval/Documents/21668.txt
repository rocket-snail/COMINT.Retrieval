on multipole expansions in the theory of electromagnetic
    radiation a new method is developed for expanding the
    electromagnetic field of radiating charges and currents in
    multipole components outside a sphere enclosing all sources the
    field is represented in terms of debye potentials which are
    shown to be closely related to the radial components of the
    electric and magnetic vectors attention is drawn to remarkably
    simple source representations of these radial components a
    discussion of vector potential versus debye potential
    representation of multipole fields is included only familiarity
    with ordinary vector calculus is required
