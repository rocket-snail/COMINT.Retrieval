the ultra bandwidth finline coupler the finline coupler
    is a recently developed microwave circuit element with which it
    has been possible to assemble hybrid junctions directional
    couplers and polarization selective couplers capable of
    operating over bandwidths of at least three to one in frequency
    constructional details and experimental d results are
