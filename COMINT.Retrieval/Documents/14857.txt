barrier layer photo emf of photo electric elements with
    dyestuffs tests were made on photo elements consisting of dye
    stuffs deposited on a quartz plate clamped between semi
    transparent electrodes of pt au or rh three different types of
    assembly were transversely illuminated in most cases a positive
    photo emf was obtained
