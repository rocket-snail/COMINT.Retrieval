theory of concepts. translation of a paper delivered at a
    1975 brazilian conference on library science and documentation
    analysing the function of concepts in natural language with
    reference to the formulation of new concepts necessitated by
    the growth of knowledge. the discussion covers the relation
    between natural and artificial languages; the construction of
    concepts by synthesising the characteristics of the objects
    they represent; the kinds of relationships existing between
    concepts sharing common characteristics; intension and
    extension of concepts; the categorisation of concepts and
    systems construction by coordination; and finally procedures
    for defining concepts so as to promote utilisation of new
    terms.
