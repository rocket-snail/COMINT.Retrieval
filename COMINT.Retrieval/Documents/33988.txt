the audio frequency negative feedback amplifier as a
    filter circuit a single stage rc feedback amplifier is
    represented by an equivalent damped parallel lc circuit and a
    locus diagram for amplification is constructed the method is
    applied to a two stage amplifier an expression analogous to
    form factor in filter theory being derived in terms of feedback
    ratio this is useful for determining the effect of feedback on
    the frequency characteristic in af amplifier design
