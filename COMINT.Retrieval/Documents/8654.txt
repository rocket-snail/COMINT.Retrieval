sharpening of observational data in two dimensions the
    problem considered is that of recovering true distributions
    from smoothed observed distributions this involves the solution
    of a linear integral equation several methods of solving the
    equation are examined and a technique for the application of
    polynomial solutions is presented the effect of random errors
    in the observational data is taken into account wherever
    possible
