radio echo measurements of the orbits of faint sporadic
    meteors a survey has shown tht many such meteors move in orbits
    of very short period the moe eccentric orbits are near the
    plane of the ecliptic but some are circular and have
    inclinations near the significance of the results is
    discussed
