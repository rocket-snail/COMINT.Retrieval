notation for indexing languages and classifications (in
    german). an overview is given of the basic types of notation
    that can be designed. included are the sequential (or purely
    ordinal) notations with hierarchical level indicator. it is
    shown that left aligned sequential notations are very flexible.
    the evaluation of notations, carried out with an example, is
    done with a quite comprehensive catalogue of desiderata. for
    design decisions, the methods of worth analysis are
    recommended, especially when considering whether or not to
    employ notation at all. another possibility is to use
    notational symbols only for certain hierarchical levels.
