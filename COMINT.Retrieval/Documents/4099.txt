the solar control of the e and f layers at high latitudes
    the monthly mean critical frequencies of the e and f layers at
    high latitudes vary diurnally with solar zenith angle according
    to a modified chapman law measurements of the seasonal latitude
    and solar cycle phase dependence of the e layer sensitivity to
    solar zenith angle and subsolar frequency are shown graphically
    in the auroral zone e layer sensitivity to solar zenith angle
    is very low but to the north of the zone it has the chapman
    theoretical value
