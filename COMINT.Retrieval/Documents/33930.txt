extra-mural functions of university libraries. for over
    10 years public libraries have been buying more academic
    literature than before and university libraries offering the
    use of their facilities to people outside the university. this
    extra-mural work must not be reduced because of financial
    problems; the obvious need for academic material must be
    satisfied and inter-library loans and purchasing schemes must
    result in a better coordinated and more economical use of
    literature. the building up of union catalogues using
    electronic data processing and of decentralised microfiche and
    screen text services will ease the demand on university special
    collections. isolation of university libraries will not improve
    their public image and could prove costly.
