administrative constraints as a hindrance to the
    development of documentation services. discusses why
    documentation services at present are meeting administrative
    opposition to expansion and development, and some possible
    solutions, with reference to classical organisation theory.
    examines the environmental and economic obstacles to
    accessibility of information and development of services, and
    proposes that organisation performance be rated according to
    its use, not its objectives. if this is accepted, the increased
    use of information networks would provide a possible solution
    to current problems, but certainly greater emphasis on
    management techniques is essential in training information
    professionals.
