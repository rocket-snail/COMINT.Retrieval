barcoding a collection-why, when, and how. as a small to
    medium-sized library, carnegie-mellon university libraries'
    approach to library automation was to aim for an integrated

    identifiers and enter the unique identifier into the data base

    identification systems are reviewed. the type of labels chosen
    and the procedures used for labeling items and for entering the
    barcode information into the machine-readable record are
    discussed.
