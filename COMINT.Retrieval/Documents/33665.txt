limit cycle period of nonlinear oscillation the problem
    is discussed with reference to previous work on the solution of
    the van der pol equation a formula is derived for the limit
    cycle period which is applicable both for small and large
    values of corresponding respectively to quasi sinusoidal and
    relaxation oscillations results obtained from various formulae
    are compared in a table
