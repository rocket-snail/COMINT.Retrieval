operating experience with a transistor digital computer a
    description of the performance of a small laboratory model
    digital computer over a period of a year with analysis of
    service ability and transistor failures the failure rate of
    point contact transistors was higher than expected but was of
    the same order as that quoted by other workers for standard
    thermionic valves in digital computers
