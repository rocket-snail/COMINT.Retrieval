the theory of the reflectivity of metals the reflectivity
    of an ideal metal for infrared radiation is calculated by a
    quantum mechanics method results agree with those obtained by
    dingle of using classical methods the diffuse reflection wave
    functions correspond more closely than the specular reflection
    wave functions to the actual electronic wave functions as
    indicated by experimental results
