on the reflection of electromagnetic waves from a medium
    excited by acoustic waves theory is developed for the variation
    of density and temperature in a liquid caused by an acoustic
    wave generating regions of maximum and minimum dielectric
    constant modulation of a wave reflected from an acoustically
    disturbed water surface is observed
