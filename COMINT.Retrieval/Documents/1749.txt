intamel conference in budapest, 1981. 26 libraries and 12
    countries were represented at the international association of
    metropolitan city libraries conference. new projects for the
    coming year will include computerisation and maintenance of
    basic services in a time of world recession. 2 main conference
    topics were' advantages of centralising the stocks of large
    libraries, or breaking them down into subject specialisations.
    discussion was based on a paper produced by the hungarian
    library institute; and scientific research and publications
    originating from individual libraries-this varies widely
    according to the facilities available, but some libraries
    produce a great deal of bibliographical research. a variety of
    visits during the conference gave the impression that hungarian
    libraries were much influenced by western developments and that
    libraries were heavily used.
