user/information system interface study. report on a
    working party at the brazilian national university library
    seminar in jan 81. from an analysis of a document on user
    training, the group concluded that librarians were deficient in
    their conception of their role, and moved to consider the
    reasons for this. the discussions lead to the conclusion that
    the current training programmes reflected the general social
    tendency to undervalue the importance of information.
    recommendations were finally presented on improvements in
    professional training and the initiation of further research on
    users. a list of participants in the working party is
    attached.
