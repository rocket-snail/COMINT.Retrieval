the two dimensional magnetic or electric field of a
    single isolated pole piece theoretical investigation for a pole
    piece consisting of a thick plate terminated by a concave
    semicircular cylinder conformal transformations and elliptic
    functions are used the variation of the field strength along
    the edge of the pole piece and along the external axis of
    symmetry is calculated and shown graphically
