focusing electrified particles a relation is found
    between h th magnetic field strength and the coordinate such
    that the trajectories of charged particles in the xy plane pass
    through both the origin and a given point on the y axis the
    particles are assumed to have equal mass and charge h is
    derived in the form of a simple series
