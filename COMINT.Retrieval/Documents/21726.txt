the relative magnitudes of modulation products in
    rectifier modulators and some effects of feedback the various
    modulation products occurring in series shunt and ring
    modulators are evaluated for square wave switching of the
    rectifiers assuming that the terminations are resistive the
    information is used in the design of feedback modulators
