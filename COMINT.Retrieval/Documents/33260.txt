the practical significance for communication technique of
    the relation between hilbert transformation and harmonic
    analysis conformal mapping is used to show that the hilbert
    transformation can be reduced to a harmonic analysis which
    would simplify attenuation and phase calculations practical
    methods of carrying out the transformation are outlined
