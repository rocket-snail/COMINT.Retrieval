planning acquisitioning of a joint stock in a centralised
    library system. planned acquisitioning should be based on an
    analysis of the stock's composition and an evaluation of its
    basic characteristics. the ussr culture ministry recommends the
    following subject ratios' sociopolitical literature 19%-20% of
    stock; natural science, mathematics and medicine 6%-7%;
    technology and agriculture-each 6%; art and sport-6%-7%;
    fiction-48%-50%; linguistics, literature, geography and
    general-8%. literature of the last 5 years should comprise 50%
    of stock. correspondence of the stock's subject content with
    readers' requirements is revealed by comparing its subject
    structure with that of the issue. language composition of stock
    should also depend on reader demand. results of
    stock-evaluation must underly the planning of current
    acquisitions and 5-year plans.
