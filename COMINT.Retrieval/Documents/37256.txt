kilovolt delta function generator a pulse is generated in
    a circuit comprising two series connected hydrogen thyratrons
    arranged to constitute the inner conductor of a coaxial line it
    is passed through of cable to a delta function generator which
    includes a pulse sharpening gap and differentiating stub this
    generator reduces the pulse rise time to and the pulse width to
    mus pulses of ither polarity may be obtained
