analog to digital data converter the required conversion
    is performed by arranging an oscillator generating pulses at a
    repetition rate proportional to the analogue voltage to feed a
    digital counters for a fixed period the oscillator described
    has a range of four decades stability is better than of maximum
    pulse frequency
