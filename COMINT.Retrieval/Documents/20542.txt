a classification for local collections' an appeal for
    cooperation. in cooperation with the german library institute,
    the working group for special libraries has consulted with all
    concerned with local collections to produce a classification
    scheme which could be used throughout west germany. there will
    be a common core to the scheme, but sufficient flexibility to
    accomodate special factors, such as mountainous or coastal
    areas. the scheme is outlined in tabular form and shows 4 broad
    categories devoted to history, topography, administration,
    biographies and family histories.
