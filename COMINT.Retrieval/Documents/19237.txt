direct coupled transitron transitron arrangements are
    discussed in which the screen grid and suppressor grid of the
    pentode are connected via a resistance network various
    practical applications are possible as a result of a
    discontinuity in the characteristic circuits for detection of
    direct voltage changes eg amplifier gain alarm detection of
    alternating voltage changes eg peak suppressors and
    rectification of voltages exceeding a given level are
    considered careful design is necessary to overcome variations
    between individual valves but a very sharp trigger action can
    be produced the high sensitivity makes circuit economies
    possible
