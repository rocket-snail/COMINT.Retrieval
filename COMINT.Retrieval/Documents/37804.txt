public library boards: an exploration of their viability
    in library governance. whilst library boards have for a long
    time governed us public libraries, they are riddled with
    problems, but few librarians are willing to publicise their
    dissatisfaction with present board-librarian relationships.
    briefly surveys the history of library boards and their present
    modus operandi. summarises research findings on library boards.
    main findings indicate that there is a serious lack of
    communication between librarian and trustee; boards tend to be
    advisory only; and there is a trend towards maintenance of
    traditional library boards-but boards must be more
    representative of communities, a move that would broaden their
    political base and help in securing support.
