the determination of the electron density in
    interplanetary space the average electron density and the arc
    length of the ray path from a space vehicle to the ground can
    be measured by transmitting a pulse to the vehicle on one very
    high frequency and receiving pulses emitted from a transponder
    in the vehicle on this and on a different frequency in this way
    electron densities of the order of hundred electrons cm can be
    estimated
