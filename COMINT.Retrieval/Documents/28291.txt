the field emission initiated vacuum arc part experiments
    on arc initiation the experiments were carried out under
    conditions of high vacuum and clean cathode surface results
    show that breakdown is immediately preceded by recognizable
    emission anomalies that breakdown occurs at a critical current
    density of the order of for applied microsecond pulses in the
    range and that breakdown is independent of cathode
    bombardment
