report on the feasibility study and pilot project for a
    directory of sources of technical digests. project designed to
    estimate the size of a directory of sources of technical
    digests (i.e. state of the art reviews) and the effort and cost
    required to compile it, as well as attitudes of experts in
    appropriate fields towards it. results show that there are no
    major obstacles to producing such a publication but casts
    doubts on whether it would attract sufficient demand to justify
    the costs involved.
