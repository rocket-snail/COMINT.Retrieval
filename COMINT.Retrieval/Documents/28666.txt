a fast algorithm for computing longest common
    subsequences previously published algorithms for finding the
    longest common subsequence of two sequences of length n have
    had a best-case running time of o(n^2). an algorithm for this
    problem is presented which has a running time of o((r + n)log
    n), where r is the total number of ordered pairs of positions
    at which the two sequences match. thus in the worst case the
    algorithm has a running time of o(n^2 log n). however, for
    those applications where most positions of one sequence match
    relatively few positions in the other sequence, a running time
    of o(n log n) can be expected. may, 1977 hunt, j. w. szymanski,
