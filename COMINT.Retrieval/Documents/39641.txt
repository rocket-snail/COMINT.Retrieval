the incorporation of patent information in the
    information system on civil engineering. if more information on
    patents is included in the civil engineering information
    system, wider and more rational achievements will result and
    more help can be given to other national and international
    information systems. patent information services should provide
    documentation of literature, searching, selective information
    dissemination, maintenance of a minimal stock of primary and
    secondary material on patents, an express copying service,
    production of bibliographies and cooperation with the other
    information services. future developments should show improved
    cooperation with other patent information systems and with
    service users and more research into terminology and staff
    training methods. the system should release scientific research
    workers from much routine work.
