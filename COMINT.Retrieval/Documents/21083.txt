the incidence of meteor particles upon the earth radio
    echo rates for both shower and sporadic meteors measured at
    adelaide with cw equipment are applied to the calculation of
    the incident flux above limiting brightnesses in the region of
    dependence of ionizing probability on velocity is discussed and
    the fluxes and densities agree reasonably well with independent
    evaluations from visual meteor rates
