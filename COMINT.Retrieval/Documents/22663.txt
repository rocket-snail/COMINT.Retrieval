investigation of the propagation of signals in dispersive
    media using an acoustic model the theory of propagation of
    waves in a dispersive medium as developed by sommerfeld and
    brillouin is experimentally verified by measurements on an
    acoustic model which comprises a long hollow tube with closely
    spaced helmholtz resonators along it
