quasi degenerated modes in high dielectric cavities a
    theoretical and practical investigation is made of resonators
    comprising solid circular cylinders composed of materials such
    as titanates having permittivities of with or without
    metallization of the surfaces as a consequence of the high
    permittivities cavity resonator techniques can be used in the
    vhf range for cylinders with the ends not metallized quasi
    degenerate te modes can be realized tuning can be effected by
    inserting magnetic rods or by applying conductive disks
    externally a design for an aerial developed from the te mode
    resonator comprises a dielectric spiral coiled round a magnetic
    rod practical disadvantages inherent in these high permittivity
    dielectrics are indicated
