remarks on the annual and diurnal variations of the
    occurrence of whistlers the annual variation of whistler
    density observed at kuhlungsborn appears to be correlated with
    the thunderstorm activity of south africa and not with that of
    the conjugate point which is at a higher geomagnetic latitude
    nocturnal variations of whistler density show phase differences
    between summer and winter which are attributed to absorption in
    the lower ionosphere
