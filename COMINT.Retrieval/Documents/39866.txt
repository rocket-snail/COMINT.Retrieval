putting the library on the box: the coolock experiment.
    describes the making of a video film on library use by the
    staff of the coolock public library in dublin city for user
    education. discusses a number of difficulties involved in the
    making of the film, and notes some of the lessons learnt by
    staff during its production. indicates some improvements which
    could have been made in the film if it had been produced by
    professional film makers and on more sophisticated equipment.
    nevertheless, stresses the need for librarians to become
    involved in film production in order to become aware of the
    implications of such projects.
