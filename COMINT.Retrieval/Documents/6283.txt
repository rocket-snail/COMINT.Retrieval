rc or direct coupled power stage analysis is performed
    for an rc or direct coupled output stage consisting of an ideal
    triode of resistance anode feed resistance r and load
    resistance r to determine the relations between and for maximum
    efficiency the formula derived is evaluated for some particular
    cases
