on the f layer distribution in polar region results of an
    analysis of monthly mean values of and for march are summarized
    in a region along the auroral zone where the values are
    anomalously high maxima occur at noon and midnight and the
    region rotates round the earth with the sun the increase of
    apparent height of the f layer is due to wave retardation in
    the f layer during daytime in high latitudes
