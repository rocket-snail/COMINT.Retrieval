movements of the f layer of the ionosphere during
    geomagnetic bay disturbances the vertical movement of the f
    layer during and after geomagnetic disturbances i evaluated
    from ionospheric soundings made at lindau germany the movement
    is treated theoretically on the basis of the plasma theory
    developed by lucas and schluter of and to account for the rise
    of the layer use is made of martyns theory allowing for the
    influence of the neutral gas by comparing calculated and
    measured data estimates of conductivity and neutral gas density
    in the ionosphere can be made
