exchange of publications between yugoslav and soviet
    libraries as a factor of cultural cooperation. the aim of this
    study was to find out the current state of the exchange of
    publications between yugoslav national libraries and libraries
    in the ussr. 8 national libraries participated in the survey,
    the results of which are analysed. among the aspects covered
    were' the soviet exchange partners, subjects of publications
    exchanged (the highest percentage is that of librarianship
    literature followed by historiography, arts and philology,
    especially slavistics), and the proportion of exchanges in
    relation to the purchases. although in most yugoslav libraries
    exchanges are carried out systematically according to a plan
    and with regard to the needs of each library, there is a scope
    for improvement in the way of coordination on the national
    level.
