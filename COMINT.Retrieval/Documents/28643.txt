electron energy distributions in uniform electric fields
    and the townsend ionization coefficient the second order
    differential equation which expresses the equilibrium
    conditions of an electron swarm in a uniform electric field in
    a gas the electrons suffering both elastic and inelastic
    collisions with the gas molecules is solved using the jeffreys
    or wkb method of approximation the theory is illustrated by a
    comparison of calculated and observed results for
    hydrogen
