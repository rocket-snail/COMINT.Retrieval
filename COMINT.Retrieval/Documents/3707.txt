diffraction of a plane electromagnetic wave by a
    perfectly conducting paraboloid of rotation exact solution for
    arbitrary angle of incidence and polarization asymptotic
    formulae for the surface current distribution are derived for
    wavelengths small compared with the focal length of the
    paraboloid
