a probabilistic algorithm for nearest neighbour
    searching. a deterministic nearest-neighbour search algorithm
    is modified so that the user can specify a maximum tolerable
    level of error. this tolerance allows certain aspects of the
    algorithm to be handled probabilistically and this, in turn,
    allows an improvement in search speed directly related to the
    level of error permitted. thus, search time can be traded off
    against search effectiveness. results show that the
    probabilistic algorithm is substantially faster than the
    deterministic, with only a very small loss in retrieval
    quality.
