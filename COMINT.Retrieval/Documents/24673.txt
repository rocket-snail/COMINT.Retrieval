forward current surge failure in semiconductor rectifiers
    a semiconductor current limiter a constant current device is
    described which uses the field effect at a junction the reverse
    bias applied controls the conductance of a thin sheet of
    semiconductor various models and a particular design are
    discussed and some applications to switching and waveform
    generation are given
