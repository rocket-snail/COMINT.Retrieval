magnetocompressiona disturbance in a tepid plasma the
    examination of steady state pulses travelling at right angles
    to a magnetic field in a cold plasma is extended to a tepid
    plasma a linear and quasi nonlinear analysis is given from
    which it is shown that pulses exist when the disturbance speed
    is supersonic
