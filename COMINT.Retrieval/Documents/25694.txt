training of information specialists' papers presented at
    a symposium held at pretoria, south africa on 6-7. in the last
    decade a new industry has emerged from the conjunction of data
    bases, computers, telecommunications and on-line information
    retrieval. the growth of this industry is reviewed showing how
    the initial application of computers for production purposes
    produced new forms of information which allowed the development
    of computerised retrieval. the various trends in the data base
    field are identified and the results of an economic modelling
    study are used to project future cost levels for searching data
    bases on-line. this generates the need for increased training
    with data bases if industry is to get maximum return from their
    use.
