united nations bibliographic information system (unbis).
    the united nations bibliographic information system (unbis) was
    developed to provide expanded reference and information
    services at the united nations dag hammarskjold library in new
    york, and to achieve comprehensive bibliographic control of un
    documentary and externally-acquired materials needed for the
    un's programmes and activities. the primary objective of this
    computer-based integrated on-line system development has been
    to achieve optimum compatibility with other international
    systems by following international standards for bibliographic
    description, use of a vocabulary aligned with other major
    international lists and thesauri, and achieving a 1-to-1 match
    of data elements with those used by the existing international
    information systems. current and proposed unbis activities are
    described.
