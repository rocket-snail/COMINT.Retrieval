publication rate as a function of laboratory size in
    three biomedical research institutions. in 3 biomedical
    research institutions, there is no indication of a single
    laboratory size at which the number of publications per
    scientist is maximal or minimal. in a scattergram of the number
    of publications of a laboratory against laboratory size, the
    horizontal coordinate measures the number of scientists in a
    laboratory, the vertical axis measures the number of
    publications from the laboratory (counting each publication
    once regardless of the number of authors), and each laboratory
    is represented by one point. scattergrams for the rockefeller
    university (new york), the national institute for medical
    research (london), and the national cancer institute (bethesda)
    are each described well by a straight line through the origin.
    the slopes of the lines for the three institutions are not
    significantly different. in these laboratories, ranging in size
    from 1 to 46 scientists, one additional scientist increases the
    expected annual number of publications of a laboratory by
    approximately 1.1, regardless of the size of the
    laboratory.
