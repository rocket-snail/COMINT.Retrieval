public library services in friesland. the 1st public
    library financed from local authority sources in the province
    of friesland in the netherlands was founded at leeuwaarden in
    1905. in the years following, libraries were founded in the
    other large towns of the province, whilst in the smaller
    communities libraries staffed with unpaid volunteers were
    formed, often with the support of the local church authorities.
    following the formation in 1917 of the vereniging voor openbaar
    leeszaalwezen in friesland (association of public reading rooms
    in friesland) a regular delivery of book boxes was organised by
    the town libraries for the local community libraries.
    throughout the province there are now some 180,000 registered
    public library users, representing more than 30% of the
    population, and loans total some 8 million annually.
