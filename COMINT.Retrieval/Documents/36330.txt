method of determining the true height of the ionospheric
    layers taking account of the effect of the geomagnetic field
    part application of an approximate expression for the
    refractive index ordinary ray case expressions are derived for
    the characteristic parameters of an ionospheric region assuming
    a parabolic law for the ionization the values of the virtual
    heights of the f layer for frequencies in the range are
    calculated and compared with the observed heights and those
    calculated by appletons method the correction term in the
    expression for the thickness of the layer shows that the effect
    of the geomagnetic field is such as to reduce the value of the
    thickness numerical results are in good agreement with the
    corrections indicated by shinn and whale of
