palaeography in the national archive. text of a paper
    delivered at a symposium in the cuban national library in 1978.
    the collection until recently contained very little manuscript
    material of particular interest, and no staff were trained in
    spanish palaeography. in 1945 a general archive training
    course, which included palaeography, was held, using
    photocopies of originals. since 1959, many long-standing
    projects have been realised, including the acquisition of large
    manuscript collections dating from the 16th century, containing
    important documents for the study of cuba's history.
    accordingly, since 1962, new training programmes in spanish
    palaeography have been initiated. details are given of the new
    material still being added to the archive.
