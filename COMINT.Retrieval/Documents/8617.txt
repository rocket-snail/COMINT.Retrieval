a relation between f layer disturbance and geomagnetic
    condition a correlation is found between the daily mean value
    of the electron density of the f layer and the storminess of
    the geomagnetic field the f layer electron density appears to
    decrease in local summer and increase in local winter in the
    middle latitude regions of both the northern and southern
    hemispheres
