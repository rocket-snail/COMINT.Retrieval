school libraries-a dream of the 1970s. educational reform
    cannot take place without the inclusion of the basic cultural
    technology. particular success in this field has been shown in
    the 3 combined school and public libraries in hanover, which
    contains a wide range of material and equipment for class and
    individual study and for leisure activities. if purchasing,
    processing and control of school library media stocks are to be
    integrated into centralised public library services, the right
    to financial provision must be guaranteed. more clarity is
    needed regarding the calculation of processing costs; staffing
    costs should be borne by local government, material and binding
    costs by the schools. some problems concerning the organisation
    of use procedures, e.g. ticket writing and fine collection,
    remain unsolved.
