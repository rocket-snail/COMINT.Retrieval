the cryosar a new low temperature computer component the
    cryosar is a high speed component whose operation at about is
    based on impact ionization of impurities in ge two types using
    compensated and uncompensated ge can be used as bistable and
    normal diodes respectively turn on time is about sec they are
    very small and present results suggest excellent
    reliability
