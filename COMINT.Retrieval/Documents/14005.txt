design of microwave filters with quarter wave couplings
    resonator diaphragms are constructed from triplets of inductive
    posts whose spacing and radii are chosen to prevent the
    generation of the first five non propagating modes this is
    sufficient to ensure negligible coupling at quarter wave
    separation measurements on filters at indicate a satisfactory
    performance
