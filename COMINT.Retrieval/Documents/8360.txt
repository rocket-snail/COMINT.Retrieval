a distributed data entry network for database producers.
    having entries for a bibliographic data base prepared at widely
    separated units presents problems of logistics, communication,
    standardisation, control and cost-effectiveness. cab is
    overcoming these by implementing the formatext-11 software
    package on a star network of minicomputers (pdp 11) at 15
    centres in the uk. the 1st installation of the new system
    immediately demonstrated its potential for fast, accurate input
    at low cost. specially designed for processing structured
    alphanumeric data, formatext-11 has facilities for forms
    design, authority file definition and maintenance, character
    set definition, source text entry, proof printing, releasing
    and data communications. the ease with which the 1st 3 of these
    facilities can be modified makes formatext-11 a uniquely
    flexible tool for producers of bibliographic data bases,
    directories, encyclopaedias and dictionaries.
