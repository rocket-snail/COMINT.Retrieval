information technology. a true on-line catalogue requires
    bibliographic records of at least 350-400 characters per title,
    a minimum of 6 access points, and a sufficient number of
    terminals to offer all users prompt access. a library may
    develop an on-line catalogue by purchasing software from
    another library or joining a turnkey system whereby a company
    provides all hardware, software, installation, training, and
    maintenance at a contracted price. issues to be considered when
    examining the options include data base content, fullness of
    records, authority control, access keys, boolean logic, user
    friendliness, display formats, security, and back-up provision.
    libraries undertaking on-line catalogues in 1981 are
    pioneers.
