automated system for generating thesaurus from subject
    representations. the work reported uses a coding scheme
    developed for augmenting the subject strings to make them
    suitable for generating a thesaurus. the system is fully
    automatic unlike earlier systems. it has 5 phases namely,
    coding phase, term-pair generation phase, coordinate term-pair
    generation phase, translation phase and printing phase. the
    system is described briefly giving the systems flow chart and
    inputs and outputs of the different phases together with a
    sample printout of a model thesaurus generated using test data
    of about 60 subject strings in telephony.
