the place of the national library in the swedish library
    and information system. paper presented at the 1st
    swedish-soviet seminar on 'the national library within a
    county's library and information services' development
    prospects' held in moscow, 21-22 nov 78. the swedish library
    system is divided into 2 sections-national libraries (serving
    the general public) and special (including university,
    institutional and government libraries). the function of the
    swedish national library is held by the royal library; the
    coordinating role rests with the council of research libraries.
    the tendency toward centralisation resulted, in 1975, in the
    establishment of the council for information services with the
    function of central coordination and planning of the national
    information system. the organisational role in this sphere
    rests with the royal library.
