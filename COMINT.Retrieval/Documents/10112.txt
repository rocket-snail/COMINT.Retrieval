solar proton impact zones the trajectories of charged
    particles in a magnetic dipole field are calculated numerically
    and applied to data on the relative number of impacts in the
    northern and southern geomagnetic hemispheres depends strongly
    on season low energy protons are focused into i small impact
    areas on the earth
