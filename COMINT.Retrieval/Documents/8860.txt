noise of metal contacts measurements were made of the
    small voltage fluctuation produced by the passage of direct
    current through ball contacts current values from to about were
    used and the influence of contact resistance pressure and
    temperature was investigated for steel copper and gold contacts
    a possible mechanism accounting for the results is
    suggested
