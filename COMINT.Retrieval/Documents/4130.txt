radio echo studies of meteor ionization the physical
    properties of the meteors and the columns of ionization which
    they produce and the properties of the atmosphere in the meteor
    ionization region were investigated using mainly pulse
    equipment operating in the waveband the development of a
    satisfactory theory of scattering of radio waves from meteor
    trails together with the theory of evaporation from meteors
    makes possible the detailed interpretation of the radio echoes
    obtained in particular the estimated incident flux of meteors
    is found to be sufficient to maintain a continuous ionospheric
    layer extending from down to below which ionization will be
    distributed in patches becoming fewer and larger with
    decreasing height over references
