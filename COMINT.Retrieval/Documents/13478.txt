the testing of relational indexing procedures by
    diagnostic computer programs. information retrieval in a
    relational indexing system has been tested by means of a suite
    of computer programs which will carry out searches in a variety
    of ways, with, on demand, detailed diagnostic feedback at any
    stage. the performance of the system can thus be evaluated as a
    'system' separately from user judgements of the output. details
    of the programming are described. some initial results are
    discussed with respect to strengths and possible weaknesses of
    the system.
