electromagnetic field expansions in loss free cavities
    excited through holes the electromagnetic field in a loss free
    cavity excited through holes cannot be completely expressed in
    terms of the short circuit modes of the cavity satisfying the
    condition that the tangential component of the electric field
    is zero on the boundary of the cavity including the openings
    for a complete expansion it is necessary to add an irrotational
    magnetic field which contributes a term inversely proportional
    to the frequency to the usual admittance matrix if the cavity
    is presumed to include a reasonable portion of the guides
    feeding the openings this irrotational component becomes almost
    diagonal
