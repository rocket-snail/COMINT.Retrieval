a critical survey of union catalogues in universities.
    efforts made since the mid 19th century to produce alphabetical
    union catalogues of all books within a university have been
    hampered by the difficulty of access to some institute library
    stocks, by inaccurate cataloguing in institute libraries and by
    the questionable value of a central catalogue within purchasing
    policy. since 1970, however, professional opinion has been
    increasingly in favour of union catalogues in universities;
    work in this field at various universities is described and
    evaluated through analysis of interlibrary loan figures. these
    catalogues should be produced only when certain conditions
    prevail, e.g. when institute stock subject coverage is much
    wider than that of the central library, when access to the
    union catalogue is easy and when the catalogue can be produced
    without detriment to other work.
