significance of the mandelstam condition in the
    oscillations of a neon lamp theory presented previously of is
    generalized for relaxation oscillations to occur three
    conditions must be satisfied simultaneously including the
    mandelstam condition which requires that the energy of the
    system shall remain constant at the discontinuity this
    condition can be satisfied using a rc circuit but not using a
    rl circuit
