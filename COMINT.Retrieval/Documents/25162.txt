a few practical remarks on the user-friendliness of
    online systems. a list of general properties of a user-friendly
    on-line system is presented. unfortunately, the requirements of
    experienced users on the one hand, and of the beginners or
    incidental users on the other hand, are contradictory.
    synonymous commands, less strictly formalised input data
    transformed to standardised formats by intelligent input
    programs, explicit as well as implicit input data, free choice
    between default or user's own parameters and procedures or
    macrocommands, can make any system more friendly even for
    heterogeneous user population.
