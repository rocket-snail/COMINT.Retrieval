hysteria is unnecessary' observations from a study tour
    of the usa. the tour was made in connection with plans for
    developing german information and documentation services. many
    us developments could not be transferred directly to europe
    since they would be unsuitable for a small market. in the usa a
    wide range of institutions is involved in information
    dissemination, in contrast with the smaller, government-based
    organisation planned for west germany. the us economic climate
    lends itself to experiment better than the european. the us
    market for literature reference data bases has reached
    saturation point and the main growth areas are in factographic
    and full text data bases. current trends are against the
    supermarket approach to selling. a wide range of technological
    experiments are being carried out. many people consider that
    the close link with libraries is returning information science
    development.
