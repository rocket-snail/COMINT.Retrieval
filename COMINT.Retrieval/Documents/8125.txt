on the scattering matrix of symmetrical waveguide
    junctions fundamental properties of the scattering matrix are
    derived tomonagas theory for lossless resonant structures is
    extended to include the effect of losses the structural
    symmetry of microwave circuits is discussed junctions
    consisting of two parallel sections of rectangular waveguide
    with one side common being particularly considered the theory
    of directional couplers with such symmetry is developed an
    attenuator and standard matching transformer each having a
    directional coupler as a basic unit are described other forms
    of resonant coupling are discussed
