tilts in the ionosphere during the solar eclipse of
    directional measurements at nearly vertical incidence on the
    layer during the eclipse showed the existence of a tilt whose
    direction agreed with that expected from the geometry of the
    eclipse the magnitude of the tilt was also of the same order as
    that calculated from observed changes in the height of
    reflection oblique incidence bearing measurements on signals
    reflected from the normal layer failed to reveal any eclipse
    effect and theoretical calculation showed that no detectably
    large effect would have been expected in this case
