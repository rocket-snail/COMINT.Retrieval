threshold of secondary electron emission of nickel and
    molybdenum the threshold is defined as the minimum energy of
    primary electrons for which the number of slow secondary
    electrons differ from zero experimental results show that it is
    equal to the work function within the limits of experimental
    error the velocity distribution of secondary electron including
    reflected electrons at various primary electron energies and
    the effect of pe treatment of mo by heating at for a period up
    to days are discussed and the experimental results shown
    graphically
