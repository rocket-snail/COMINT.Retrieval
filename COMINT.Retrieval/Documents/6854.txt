production and consumption of information in the
    university. argues that the information specialist should, in
    mediating between producers and consumers, exercise
    discrimination in assessing information needs and adopt a
    qualitative rather than a quantitative approach. discusses the
    quantitative studies of information production published over
    the last 20 years, and proposes an alternative viewpoint based
    on baudrillard's sociological analysis of consumption,
    emphasising the social implications of consumer demands. if the
    sociological pressures behind user needs are understood, the
    information specialist is then able to both monitor user
    requirements and exercise some influence over the production of
    information designed to meet social pressures rather than
    intellectual objectives.
