propagation of electromagnetic waves in a gyrotropic
    medium correction to paper abstracted direct comparison of hall
    effect and corbino effect by using a cylindrical sample
    immersed in a a radial magnetic field a transverse current is
    produced when an alternating voltage is applied between the
    ends of the cylinder this transverse current gives rise to an
    induced voltage in a coaxial coil both the corbino and the hall
    effects can be measured with this arrangement thus providing
    two independent means of determining the hall constant the
    discrepancy between the two results is
