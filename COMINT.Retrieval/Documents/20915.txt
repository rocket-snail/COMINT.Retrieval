why fight grid current in class b modulators by using
    triode valves with low anode resistance and low amplification
    factor efficient operation of audio amplifiers can be obtained
    without allowing the grid voltage to swing positive grid
    current is thus avoided direct coupling may be used between the
    driving amplifier and a modulator operated in this way
    permitting the use of a large amount of negative feedback
    measured response and distortion are presented for a modulator
    designed on these lines
