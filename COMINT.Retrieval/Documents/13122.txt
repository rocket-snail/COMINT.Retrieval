nonlinear effects in electron plasmas a mathematical
    study of three groups of effects namely the excitation of
    harmonics coherent interaction and incoherent interaction
    complications of finite boundaries external fields non zero
    temperature multistream flow and collisions are ignored the
    main interest is in the incoherent interaction which results in
    spectral decay and damping effects are compared with
    experimental data
