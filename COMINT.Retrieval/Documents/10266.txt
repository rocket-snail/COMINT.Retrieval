iterative networks as coupling networks in oscillator
    circuits the conditions for self oscillation are established
    for valve and transistor oscillators the characteristics of
    iterative networks consisting of purely resistive and reactive
    elements are summarized and their application in valve and
    transistor oscillators is investigated formulae are given for
    operating parameters and are verified experimentally
