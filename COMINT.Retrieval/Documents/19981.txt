the distribution of electrons in the ionosphere the
    methods of deriving profiles are reviewed with particular
    emphasis on those which include the effects of the earths
    magnetic field attention is drawn to the use of the
    extraordinary ray for estimating the electron density below the
    peak of the e layer some results are given of typical diurnal
    seasonal solar cycle and latitude variations in the electron
    density distribution references
