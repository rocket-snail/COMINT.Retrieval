multiple authorship and author collaboration in
    agricultural research publications. the increase in the
    frequency of multiple author papers and the increase in the
    number of authors per paper in an agricultural journal over the
    period 1958 to 1978 are described. the frequency of
    single-author papers drops from 65.5% in 1958 to 34.3% in 1978
    and the frequency of 2-author papers increases from 28.1% to
    41.4%. over the same period the average number of authors per
    paper increases from 1.43 to 1.99 (maximum 2.16 in 1976).
    possible correlations between author affiliations and multiple
    authorship are suggested; authors in new zealand appear
    preferentially to collaborate with co-authors in the same type
    of institution.
