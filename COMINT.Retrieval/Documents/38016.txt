observations of unusual radio frequency noise emission
    and absorption the noise enhancements observed during periods
    of solar activity are classified as smooth or abrupt while
    smooth changes occur in both day and night hours the abrupt
    increases are observed only near local midnight the smooth
    enhancements occur almost simultaneously with the absorption of
    radiation in a sector of the northern sky
