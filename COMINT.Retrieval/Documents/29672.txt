measurement of ionospheric electron densities using an rf
    probe technique the probe consists of a dipole operating at mcs
    and has been flown in a rocket over fort churchill above km it
    behaves as a capacitor the capacitance of which is telemetered
    to the ground the local electron density in the ionosphere may
    be calculated from these values by using a simplified form of
    the appleton hartree equation the electron densities obtained
    using such probes are in good agreement with those obtained by
    normal methods
