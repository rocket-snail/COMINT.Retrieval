the theory of the magnetoresistance effects in polar
    semiconductors theory developed previously for conduction in
    polar semiconductors of is extended to deal with effects
    occurring in the presence of a magnetic field hall coefficient
    and magnetoresistance effect are shown graphically as functions
    of the magnetic field strength and of the temperature and
    degree of degeneracy of the electron gas at low temperatures
    the magnetoresistance effect may become very large contrary to
    the prediction of the free path theory
