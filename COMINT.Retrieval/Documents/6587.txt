studies of the upper atmosphere from invercargill new
    zealand parts two and three analysis of data shows that a the
    probability of occurrence of radar echoes increases with an
    increase in local magnetic k index b a radar auroral zone
    exists whose size is related to the k index c echoes are
    observed in the daytime to less extent than suggested by the
    diurnal variation of local k index d there is no direct
    relation between radar echo regions observed at fifty five mc s
    and visual aurorae part one above
