the refractive indices of water vapour air oxygen
    nitrogen and argon at experiments indicate that the refractive
    indices of water vapour air anden are modified at microwave
    frequencies in the manner to be expected from dipole theory the
    values for nitrogen and argon should not vary with frequency
    and this is confirmed
