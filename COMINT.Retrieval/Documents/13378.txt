job motivation and satisfaction of reference staff in
    public libraries. argues that despite automation, library work
    will remain labour intensive; it is therefore essential to
    consider the human aspect of the situation, particularly in
    reference work, where in general the quality is low. to
    investigate the relation between job motivation and
    satisfaction, a survey was carried out among ontario reference
    library staff, using techniques of analysis and measurement
    adapted from the field of business studies. details are given
    of the methodology, questionnaire construction, and rating
    techniques. results showed generally moderate satisfaction with
    environmental conditions, but low motivation. the initial
    hypothesis, that professionals would express greater motivation
    and satisfaction than non-professionals, was not
    confirmed.
