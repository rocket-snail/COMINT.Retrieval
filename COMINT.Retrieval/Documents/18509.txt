a computer-produced serials book catalog with
    automatically generated indexes. the serials book catalogue at
    the iowa state university library provides access to 33,000
    serial records by titles, corporate bodies and subject
    headings. access points are generated automatically from the
    central serials data base by a unique, locally written computer
    program which allows great flexibility in records manipulation.
    local control of catalogue production permits expansion of the
    program format by the creation of local tags and linkage to
    related monograph records in the card catalogue, while
    providing a basis for further automation of serials
    control.
