a6 size microfiche for the motor industry. introduction
    to british standards bs 5956:1980. the motor industry has, over
    the years, gradually adopted the microfiche for the supply of
    information relating to specification and service parts. a
    british standard has now been produced, recommending the use of
    an a6 microfiche produced to a 48x with a total of 270
    landscape images per fiche as the preferred standard, with an
    alternative of 420 portrait images also at 48x. the standard is
    recommended for introduction by all new users in the motor
    industry of microfiche systems, and also has a strong
    suggestion that those vehicle/engine manufacturers who are
    already using a non-standard microfiche system consider
    changing in the very near future.
