libraries and buildings. interrelationships exemplified
    by the heidelberg university library. the growth of libraries
    in this century has led to regular rebuilding and rehousing of
    university libraries. this has not been the case at the
    heidelberg university library. the library was built in 1905
    and is still housed in the original building which is now
    protected as a listed building. in the 1950s some interior
    structural alterations were made to improve the general
    efficiency of the library. from 1959 to 1978 various plans were
    made for new university library buildings. these included an
    extension to the library in part of the old town of heidelberg,
    a new building on a new site to serve the medical and
    scientific faculties and small extensions for extra storage.
    finally due to planning restrictions in the old town and the
    1966/67 recession the library remained as it was with temporary
    use of a medical institute building which involves transport
    problems between the 2 sites.
