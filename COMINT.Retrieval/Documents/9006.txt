new array for radio astronomical observations of the suns
    brightness at equipment installed at marcoussis comprises four
    identical parabolic mirrors of diameter located respectively at
    and along an line where the four aerials are connected to a
    single receiver by lines of equal length the overall length of
    this array is as compared with for a continuous mirror to give
    the same ha half power lobe width the arrangement enables the
    first six fourier harmonics of the brightness distribution over
    the sun to e be observed at true amplitude
