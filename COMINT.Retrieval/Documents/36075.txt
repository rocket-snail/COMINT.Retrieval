pull in of nonlinear oscillators with filtered output the
    effect is considered of applying a small voltage of frequency
    to an oscillator whose fundamental frequency has been freed
    from harmonics by filtering a general formula is derived which
    gives the maximum value of for pull in to occur for the
    particular case of an oscillator with a single oscillatory
    circuit the formula reduces to the known expression q being the
    quality factor of the circuit and v the voltage amplitude of
    the free oscillations a formula is also given for the threshold
    value of below which pull in is not possible
