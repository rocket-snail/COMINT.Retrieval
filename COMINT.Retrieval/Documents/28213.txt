radio evidence of the ejection of very fast particles
    from the sun dynamic spectra of type rf bursts fast frequency
    drift duration sec are discussed the observations were made
    using a spectroscope with a frequency range harmonic pairs are
    commonly observed as in the case of the longer duration type
    bursts previously studied of february wild et al from a
    comparison of the profiles for the fundamental and the second
    harmonic it appear that a low frequency cut off process occurs
    in this case also the observed properties of type bursts can be
    accounted for by associating the frequency drift with motion of
    a disturbance such as a corpuscular stream travelling outwards
    through the solar atmosphere several possible mechanisms are
    considered
