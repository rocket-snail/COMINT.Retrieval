possible mechanism by which terrestrial corpuscular
    radiation arises in response to the action of cosmic rays
    expressions are derived giving the total number of protons and
    electrons generated per second at the equator in a tube of
    cross section the dependence of the intensity of the earths
    corpuscular radiation on height and latitude is shown
    graphically experiments show that the intensity near the
    equator is approximately times less than that calculated which
    indicates the existence of supplementary leaks from magnetic
    traps especially noticeable at high latitudes
