some results of sweep frequency investigation in the low
    frequency band frequency sweep measurements in the range are
    reported day time records show traces of three strata whose
    virtual heights are between and of which the lowest not always
    observed produces only a week echo and one sometimes suggesting
    that scattering is taking place at randomly located clouds
    night time records show an intermediate layer between the e and
    f layers which is erratic in appearance but seems to have
    continuity with the daytime e layer during sunset traces
    characteristic of magneto ionic splitting are exhibited for
    this intermediate layer polarization and virtual height records
    for the f layer at night are shown z and the effects of
    moderate ionosphere disturbances are demonstrated
