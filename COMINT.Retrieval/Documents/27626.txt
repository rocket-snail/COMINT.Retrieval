on the provision of information for the use of
    microelectronics in a factory combine. microelectronics have a
    strong influence over most contemporary industrial working
    processes, including not only the flow of material, energy and
    information but also general organisation and management. thus
    it is clear that the staff of specialist research organisations
    have a greater need than ever before of a comprehensive range
    of information. examples of this need and suggestions for its
    rational satisfaction are presented with reference to
    experiences in a strip steel factory concerning the use of
    microelectronics in industrial production, scientific research,
    financial calculations, statistics and management. the use of
    microelectronics is still in its infancy; its potential in
    large scale information storage and dissemination is not yet
    fully exploited.
