the development of user education in ghana. (phd thesis).
    in ghana, there is a positive acknowledgement of the
    information problem, but user education is not pursued with
    similar enthusiasm. examines the present user education
    programmes/activities in ghanaian educational institutions and
    research organisations with a view to identifying the
    constraints which affect such programmes. makes proposals for a
    basic infra-structure, the revision of present programmes where
    needed, and a carefully-designed appropriate methodology for
    each category of user.
