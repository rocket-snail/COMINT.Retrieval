an integral equation governing electromagnetic waves the
    problem discussed is that of determining the solution of the
    helmholtz equation for the region outside a simple closed curve
    boundary at which values of u or its normal derivatives are
    prescribed by introducing a suitable parameter constructed by
    conformal mapping the problem is reduced to a new fredholm
    integral equation whose solution is independent of conditions
    inside the boundary scattering cross section is
    discussed
