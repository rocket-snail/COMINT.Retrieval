on subharmonic synchronization of nearly linear systems
    analysis is presented for a slightly nonlinear oscillator
    driven at a frequency near a multi le of its natural frequency
    the system corresponding to the equation where the forcing term
    is of the order of unity conditions for obtaining a response at
    angular frequency are investigated by expanding y in a series
    in
