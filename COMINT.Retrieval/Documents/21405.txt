the conservation of library collections in tropical and
    sub-tropical conditions' the problems of the increased dangers
    of damage and decay in areas of high temperature and humidity.
    the general point is stressed that library collections in
    tropical and sub-tropical climates are subject to the same
    dangers as those in moderate climate zones; but it must be
    understood that all these dangers are increased, some of them
    dramatically, in warm damp climates. in tropical and
    sub-tropical climates there is the threat of damage by insects
    of a nature and to an extent that is unknown in moderate
    climate zones and finally, it is not possible to change this
    situation fundamentally by any conservation or restoration
    measures, at least not without an expenditure that would be
    unrealistic in present terms of manpower and energy.
