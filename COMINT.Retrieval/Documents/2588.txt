automatic tuning control of hf generators with varying
    load the phase relation between the primary voltage and the
    secondary current of the output transformer of a crystal driven
    generator is used for automatic control of the tuning of the
    output circuit under varying load conditions control is
    effected via a bridge type of phase measurement unit using a
    pair of type eq enneodes which acts on a control unit using a
    pair of type pl thyratrons circuit details photographs and
    performance figures are given
