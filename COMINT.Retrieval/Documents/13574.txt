managerial rating' a library effectiveness model. in nov
    71, an ad-hoc committee of librarians at washington state
    university was asked to determine if effectiveness measures
    could be applied to reference activities and, if so, to propose
    some method for collecting the necessary data. several
    effectiveness models were studied and discarded. the committee
    then tried the managerial rating model, whereby managers meet
    to identify goals and objectives, then reconvene after a given
    time to rate their levels of accomplishment. a trial indicated
    that this model was suitable and the committee reported
    accordingly, but no full trial ever took place and the
    committee was disbanded. suggests that this was due to the
    method's possible disadvantages and a lack of interest.
