free access to reading' a new policy of opportunities.
    criticises the public library policy of dividing children's
    books according to age level as contrary to the reader's right
    to select material appropriate to his own abilities. draws on
    recent studies by brazilian researchers to establish that
    fluency in reading is a skill acquired progressively at an
    individual rate determined both by an increase in mechanical
    facility and the process of maturing. thus the reader's age
    does not necessarily correspond to his reading capacity, and
    artificial divisions imposed by libraries effectively prevent
    access to suitable material. the economic and social advantages
    of permitting free choice of books are discussed in relation to
    popularising libraries and maximising use of their
    resources.
