distortion in class ab push pull amplifiers fourier
    coefficients of the current waveform for a single valve or
    transistor working under varying bias conditions are evaluated
    as a function of the angle of flow of the output current from
    these results the harmonic distortion is determined for a
    balanced push pull system and it is shown that small degrees of
    unbalance can be responsible for large contributions to the
    overall distortion principally by the introduction of second
    harmonics
