low noise tunnel diode amplifier an amplifier consisting
    of a tuned circuit shunted by a negative conductance tunnel
    diode is described and experimental gains bandwidths and noise
    figures obtained at are quoted greatly improved noise figures
    and microwave operation should be possible ultimately see
    below
