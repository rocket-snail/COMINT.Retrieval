sinusoidal and relaxation oscillations sustained by
    nonlinear reactances descriptions are given of various
    combinations of nonlinear components eg a saturating choke with
    linear components eg a capacitor whereby negative resistance
    characteristics can be obtained either of the type in which
    current is a single valued function of voltage or of the type
    in which voltage is a single valued function of current
    practical applications are discussed
