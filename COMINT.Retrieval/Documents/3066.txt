proficiency in reading as a criterion for a general
    typology of readers. some kind of classification of readers is
    necessary for the complex education of library users. much
    previous research has imposed too rigid distinctions between
    readers of fiction and nonfiction. a more relevant division
    would be according to proficiency in different reading skills'
    choosing books to read; understanding what is read; acquiring
    and using the information contained. 6 readership groups
    divided by these criteria are proposed, ranging from users with
    none of these skills to those with a harmoniously developed
    range of skills.
