the amalgamation of a small and a larger library. in the
    netherlands the public library authority of vlagtewedde, which
    with a population of 16,500 inhabitants would have been
    compelled under the dutch public library act to surrender its
    library service to the county council, combined in 1978 with
    the nearby town of stadskanaal with a population of 34,000 to
    provide a joint library service. the combined library service
    now has its main library at stadskanaal, 5 branch libraries and
    a mobile library with a total collection of approximately
    135,000 books and records. there are 16,600 registered
    borrowers and loans in 1980 totalled 750,000. library services
    throughout the region have been improved by the creation of
    documentation centres in schools and by the setting up of a
    library service for housebound readers.
