recombination of gaseous ions recombination between
    positive ions and electrons and between positive ions and
    negative ions are considered separately since the nature of the
    processes involved and the experimental techniques for
    observing them are quite different in the two cases although
    there is still little information about the rate of
    recombination of positive and negative ions at low pressure
    there has been substantial clarification of the processes of
    electron ion recombination during the last two years due to the
    application of microwave techniques the knowledge of the
    mechanism of electron ion recombination derived from both
    theory and experiment is reviewed in detail and a shorter
    account given of present knowledge of ion ion recombination at
    pressures less than that of the atmosphere recombination
    phenomena in the ionosphere in the solar corona and in
    interstellar gas are also discussed briefly references
