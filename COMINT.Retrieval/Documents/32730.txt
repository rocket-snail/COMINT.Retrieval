publishing at the library of congress. the us library of
    congress, housing 77 million items, recognises a special
    obligation to make known what it holds. the result is a
    publishing programme of catalogues, facsimiles, guides,
    research papers, letters, scholarly and trade co-publications
    and the 2quarterly journal of the library of congress1. the
    library operates like a university press, publishing 30-40
    titles per annum, but is subject to the regulations which
    control government publishing.
