the automated office: online access in a records
    management system. during the introduction of word-processing
    equipment the problem of indexing and retrieving the processed
    documents arose. the records management system allows the
    on-line indexing of records, while the thesaurus can be
    consulted on-line as well. secretaries are able to create their
    own departmental thesaurus by selecting the relevant terms from
    the corporate thesaurus.
