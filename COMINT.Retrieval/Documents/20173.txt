the use of trigram analysis for spelling error detection.
    work performed under the spelling error detection correction
    project (speedcop) supported by national science foundation
    (nsf) at chemical abstracts service (cas) to devise effective
    automatic methods of detecting and correcting misspellings in
    scholarly and scientific text is described. the investigation
    was applied to 50,000 word/misspelling pairs collected from 6
    datasets (2chemical industry notes, biological abstracts,
    chemical abstracts1, american chemical society primary journal
    keyboarding, 2information science abstracts1, and distributed
    on-line editing (dole) (a cas internal dataset especially
