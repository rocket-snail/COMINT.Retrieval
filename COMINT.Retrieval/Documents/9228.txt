some fundamental properties of networks without mutual
    inductance elementary methods not involving determinants are
    used to prove theorems on the voltage and current gains
    obtainable from a resistance network the results are used to
    determine properties of general networks without mutual
    inductance rc networks are investigated by a method simpler
    than that
