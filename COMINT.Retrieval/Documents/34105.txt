time delay and frequency response of resonant cavities
    the frequency response and time delay characteristics of
    resonant cavities are discussed it is found that a signal
    travelling through a resonant cavity undergoes a time delay
    dependent on both the cavity q and also the difference between
    the signa and resonant frequencies the time delay for a
    frequency modulated wave is calculated and checked
    experimentally
