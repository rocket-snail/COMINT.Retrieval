kinetic theory of weakly ionized homogeneous plasmas part
    the second order approximation to the electron velocity
    distribution function relating to the energy exchanges between
    an applied electric field and the plasma in a lorentz type gas
    is developed the resulting expression contains a divergent term
    corresponding to a nonstationary state in which the electron
    gas continually heats up the quality factor q of the plasma is
    calculated the derivation of certain formulae used in part is
    given in an appendix
