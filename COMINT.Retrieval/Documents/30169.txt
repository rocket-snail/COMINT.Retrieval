the role of the federal government and private
    institutions in western development' collectivism versus rugged
    individualism. introduction to a special issue on the us west.
    discusses the role played by federal government and private
    institutions in the development of the american west and the
    recreation of eastern civilisation in the western wilderness.
    contrasts this with the westerners' heavy emphasis on 'rugged
    individualism' and their failure to recognise the mutual
    interdependence of east and west. these developments and
    conflicts can be traced through government documents and
    archives.
