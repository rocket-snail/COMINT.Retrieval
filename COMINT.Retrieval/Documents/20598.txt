on the use of 'gross weight formulae' of chemical
    compounds for retrieval of information about organic compounds.
    the possibility of using the gross weight formulae of chemical
    compound bonds as filters when retrieving information on
    individual chemicals and compound classes is checked. the
    effectiveness of indexing and retrieving compounds according to
    gross weight formulae and some fragmental codes is compared.
    the ease of automatic creation of gross-weight formulae, their
    good differentiating capability, and their expedience when
    retrieving information in large files are stressed.
