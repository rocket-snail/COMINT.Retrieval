reliability of probe measurements in hot cathode gas
    diodes erroneous results may be obtained due to the work
    function of the probe altering during the measurements
    particularly when investigating tubes with oxide cathodes the
    measurement must be made immediately after cleaning the r probe
    in the experiments described a cro plotter was used which took
    ov only some seconds to record the whole probe characteristic
    in contrast to results obtained by other workers no deviation
    from the maxwellian velocity distribution of the plasma
    electrons was observed over a range of nearly four orders of
    magnitude of probe current
