the literature search that went up in smoke. since 1977,
    the librarians' union has stressed that automation in libraries
    should begin with bibliographic systems. biblioteksdata has
    replied that their development plans agree with this priority,
    but adds that local libraries must be free to decide which
    automation system to use. fears that biblioteksdata, in effect,
    is giving priority to automation of administrative tasks, such
    as issues and acquisitions, although the union has argued the
    need for terminal access for libraries to the bibliographic
    data base. provision of such access has been held up by the
    fact that the question of the best subject search system has
    not yet been solved. meantime, however, attempts should be made
    to provide terminal access with free text searching, similar
    searching on microform, and expansion of bibliographic entries
    with subject words. argues that the limited resources should be
    concentrated on the most important area' services.
