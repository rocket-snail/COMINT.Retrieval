meeting the information needs of the print
    handicapped-more than ramps and sliding doors. presents the
    view that the information needs of the handicapped are equal in
    scope to those of other people and that librarians should
    develop collections in the formats necessary to meet those
    needs. focuses on the basic components necessary to building
    and organising collections as well as the limitations to be
    encountered.
