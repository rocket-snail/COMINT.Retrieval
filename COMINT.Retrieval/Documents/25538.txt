the constants in the equation for atmospheric refractive
    index at radio frequencies the formula for scaled up
    refractivity n for air is n where k are constants the value
    proposed for k is derived from recent reliable microwave and
    optical measurements of the refractive index of dry air by
    barrell birnbaum et al of and essen and froome o after
    adjustment to allow for an average amount of co in the
    composition of the air k is derived from two other constants
    obtained from measurements of the dielectric constant of water
    vapour by birnbaum and chatterjee of please note additional
    author a table of values of the constants used by various
    workers from to is given with comments on discrepancies
