design study for an anomalous state of knowledge based
    information retrieval system. the long term aim of this
    research is to develop a retrieval system in which no explicit
    query formulation will be necessary, the system instead
    constructing a picture of the user's information need, and
    choosing a retrieval strategy appropriate to the particular
    type of need. the authors report on a preliminary study in
    which they analysed unstructured problem statements obtained by
    interviewing a number of users, used similar analysis
    techniques to represent document abstracts, and developed a
    classification scheme for problem statements.
