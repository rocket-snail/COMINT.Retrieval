sweets mechanism for merging magnetic fields in
    conducting fluids the mechanism is investigated in a semi
    quantitative manner if two oppositely directed sunspot fields
    having scales of about km were brought together sweets
    mechanism would allow them to merge in about two weeks the
    mechanism gives a means of altering quickly the configuration
    of magnetic fields in ionized gases and converting magnetic
    energy into kinetic energy of the fluid
