remarks on the pre-print of rak-wb. the rak-wb (regeln
    fur die alphabetische katalogisierung in 'wissenschaftlichen
    bibliotheken')-rules for alphabetical cataloguing in research
    libraries-have been compiled to correspond to the specific
    situation in research libraries and fulfil their purpose which
    is to bridge the time gap until rak is published in book form.
    rak-wb provides a basis for cataloguing in research libraries
    demonstrating the desired uniformity in all important points.
    its use will lead to uniform processing at all stages of
    classification which is necessary for cooperative cataloguing
    and data exchange. its value is increased by the many
    amendments and improvements which went into its make-up as a
    result of years of practical experience with rak. rak-wb has
    been quickly adopted by the rapidly expanding library
    associations. it is hoped that the planned rak-ob for public
    libraries will be of a comparable standard.
