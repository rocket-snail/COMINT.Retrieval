transformer design on insertion loss principles wide band
    transformer data can be calculated using the normalized values
    for the circuit elements of high pass and low pass networks
    derived from insertion loss theory for reactive quadripoles
    examples of which are tabulated by considering the transformer
    equivalent circuit as part of a tchebycheff filter network of
    higher order significant improvements can be made in the
    transmission characteristic by introducing special low
    permittivity layers between windings further improvement is
    possible
