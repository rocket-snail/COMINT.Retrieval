public relations work-tendencies and expectations. the
    standard of library public relations work in west germany is
    often considered to be lower than that in other countries.
    increasing financial problems in local government will soon
    make the libraries' task of keeping up with media industry
    trends more difficult. if public libraries still wish to be
    regarded as the institutions responsible for contemporary work
    with cultural media, they must provide better publicity. each
    library has individual features which can provide a focal point
    in public relations. librarians must establish good
    relationships with other local cultural organisations, who will
    then support cultural activities in the library, resulting in
    less expenditure for the librarian. the librarian should be a
    'cultural agent provocateur', organising cultural activities
    not only to increase loans but also to improve library service
    quality.
