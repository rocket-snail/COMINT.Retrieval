a double slab ferrite field displacement isolator at
    brief description with performance figures of an isolator
    comprising a waveguide with two slabs of ferrite arranged with
    transverse symmetry and subjected to equal but oppositely
    directed magnetic fields the forward loss is over most of the
    range from to and varies by over any channel while the reverse
    loss is
