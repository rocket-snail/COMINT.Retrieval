continuous electron density measurements up to electron
    distribution at altitudes from was determined accurately from
    measurements made during a rocket flight at using records the
    electron density curve was extrapolated to the maximum electron
    at density increased rapidly between in the region densities
    were in general lower than the maximum slight gradient
    variations in the lower ionosphere are probably the major cause
    of large variations of virtual height sporadic echoes are
    apparently due to partial reflections from high gradient
    regions
