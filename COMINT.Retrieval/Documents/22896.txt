detection of a radio wave by a ferrite a magneto
    strictive ferrite rod of mm square cross section and length mm
    was exposed to a uhf field pulsed at the third harmonic of the
    frequency of mechanical resonance of the rod the signal was
    detected by means of a tuned coil located at a mechanical node
    the detection process involves rectification of the uhf
    oscillation as a result of the variation of ferrite
    permeability with applied field and conversion of the rectified
    signal into a magnetostrictive vibration detectors of this type
    may be useful at wavelengths of cm
