some solar studies on the occurrence of type solar bursts
    of continuum radiation type solar emission in the frequency
    range occurs in two phases the first usually observed at
    frequencies higher than appears to be emitted low in the
    chromosphere from a source of angular size the second occurs
    high in the corona with a source size or more
