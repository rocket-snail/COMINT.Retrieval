the subject of library science. the existing definitions
    of 'the subject of library science' are reviewed and several
    scientific approaches to the definition of the subject of a
    scientific discipline are discussed. it is suggested that the
    subject of library sciences can be described as 'the laws
    governing the processes associated with and related to the use
    of books', and the subject of special librarianship as 'the
    laws governing the processes associated with and related to the
    use of books in special libraries'. believes that 'special
    librarianship' is not an independent discipline and argues that
    there is only one discipline called 'library science' and that
    the theoretical principles of soviet librarianship apply to all
    libraries.
