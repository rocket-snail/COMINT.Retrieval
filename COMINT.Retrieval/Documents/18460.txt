fuzzy requests' an approach to weighted boolean searches.
    concerns the problem of how to permit a patron to represent the
    relative importance of various index terms in a boolean request
    while retaining the desirable properties of a boolean system.
    classical boolean systems are reviewed and related to the
    notion of fuzzy sets. the fuzzy set concept then forms the
    basis of the concept of a fuzzy request in which weights are
    assigned to index terms. the properties of such a system are
    discussed, and it is shown that such systems retain the
    manipulability of traditional boolean requests.
