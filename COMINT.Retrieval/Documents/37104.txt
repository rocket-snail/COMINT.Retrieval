as american as hamburgers and apple pie. sums up the
    impressions of automation in us libraries. most larger library
    systems have now automated their technical processes, but
    automation of the more complicated bibliographic routines, such
    as literature searching which necessitate uniform and well
    developed cataloguing, is not widespread. the process of
    automation started in the 60s spurred largely by the general us
    openness towards technological developments and pressure from
    commercial firms. the lack of interlibrary cooperation and of
    standardisation of work routines in us public libraries has
    encouraged the adoption of automation systems tailor-made to
    individual libraries. the general impact of automation has not
    been much studied, but there was agreement that computer
    technology had led to centralisation, less independence for
    branches, better interlending, and had freed resources for
    other services. although fewer staff tended to be employed,
    none had been directly made redundant. no cost-benefit analyses
    seemed to have been carried out. the reactions of users, both
    staff and readers, were largely favourable, except perhaps in
    branch public libraries.
