microwave investigation of disintegrating gaseous
    discharge plasmas the phenomenon of afterglow is investigated
    both theoretically and experimentally by considering the shift
    of the resonance frequency of a microwave cavity enclosing the
    plasma measurements using binary gas mixtures show the
    production of a considerable number of atomic ions of the
    admixture even at low concentrations the process concerned in
    helium neon is a charge transfer one between a ion and a neon
    atom the relevant cross section being cm in other mixtures the
    atomic ions are produced by the penning effect and possibly the
    charge transfer process
