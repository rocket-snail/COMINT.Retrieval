a time sharing analog multiplier the circuit is based on
    the same principle as that of broomall and riebman of accuracy
    to within is achieved for a range of input voltages from to
    when the comparator voltage lies between and depending on the
    circuit arrangements multiplications per second were made
    indicating the suitability of the circuit for time sharing
    techniques but higher rates of operation seem possible
