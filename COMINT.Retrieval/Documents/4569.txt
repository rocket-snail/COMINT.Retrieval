theory of secondary emission the elementary theory of
    secondary electron emission has been generalized and modified
    to incorporate results of recent measurements of the range
    energy relation and the dissipation of energy by slow electrons
    iin solids these modifications give considerably improved
    agreement between the theoretical and experimental universal
    reduced yield curves
