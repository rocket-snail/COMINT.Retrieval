polarization of the echoes from the ionosphere details
    are given of an improved type of radio polarimeter similar in
    principle to that evolved by eckersley and farmer for operation
    in conjunction with high resolution sounding equipment with
    this arrangement it is possible to separate normal echoes from
    those received from thin layers or cloud type irregularities
    photographs of some observed polarization patterns are
    reproduced and briefly discussed
