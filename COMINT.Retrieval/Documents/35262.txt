comparative analysis of hardware versus software text
    seach. presents a hybrid approach to data base text searching,
    using the best features of inversion and streaming searching
    techniques to minimise data flow and obtain complete functional
    capability. the query is broken into 2 parts based upon the
    existence of terms (offensive terms) having leading or imbedded
    'don't cares'. those documents satisfying the part of the query
    without offensive terms are identified via inversion. these
    documents are accessed and the offensive terms are searched for
    via streaming. discusses the results of the 1st set of
    simulation runs in which the experimenters performed
    sensitivity analysis on machine processing power and % of terms
    with leading variable-length 'don't cares'.
