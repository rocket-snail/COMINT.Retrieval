an associative file store using fragments for run-time
    indexing and compression. an associative file store (afs) is
    offered as a simple solution to current problems with on-line
    information retrieval systems. it would be a single-instruction
    multiple-data stream machine, dedicated to associative file
    searching while overall control of the system would be
    entrusted to a conventional single-instruction single-data
    stream machine. the associative parallel processor (a major
    component of afs) would support 'on-the-fly' file searching and
    simplify the indexing problems of directly accessing single
    records to that of indicating the most probable scan block for
    a high recall of matching records. initial considerations
    suggest that afs would out-perform conventional file stores by
    over 2 orders of magnitude, be simple to maintain, and offer
    full free-text retrieval flexibility.
