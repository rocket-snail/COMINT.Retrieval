topographic map acquisition in us academic libraries.
    presents the results of a recent survey of topographical map
    acquisition in us academic libraries, and discusses the status
    of, and trends in, topographical map acquisition programmes.
    concludes that the level of acquisition of this mapping is
    remarkably low compared to the stated demand for it, and that
    the situation regarding foreign material is especially
    critical. identifies the major collecting problems as' loss of
    depository receipts; inadequate funding support; inflated map
    prices; increased production; and government restrictions.
    suggests that these problems could be resolved by obtaining
    better internal and external support through planning,
    organised action, and cooperative efforts, and highlights the
    need for library administrators to recognise the resource value
    of topographic mapping.
