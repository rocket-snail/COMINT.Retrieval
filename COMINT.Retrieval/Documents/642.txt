notes on the design of distributed amplifiers the
    treatment used takes account of the self capacitance of the
    coils and the effect of using anode and grid lines with
    different propagation speeds the latter effect can be useful in
    avoiding the large increase in gain of the derived filter type
    amplifier at the upper end of the band
