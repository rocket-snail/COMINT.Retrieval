distribution of trapped radiation in the geomagnetic
    field an examination of the altitude dependence of trapped
    radiation from explorer one measurements shows that the
    radiation intensity data in the vicinity of the magnetic
    equator can be well represented by the scalar intensity b of
    the real geomagnetic field the value of b at the lower boundary
    of the inner zone increases with magnetic dip latitude
