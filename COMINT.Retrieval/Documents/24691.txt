space utilization and access path length in b-trees.
    b-trees (balanced trees) are used for the maintenance of very
    large indexes. a state vector and system of differential
    equations describing the behaviour of state changes, form a
    deterministic model of the static properties. a uniform
    distribution of keys is assumed. static properties, operations
    on b-trees, and overflow and underflow treatment are defined. a
    basic model of b-trees is used to model space utilisation and
    path length which is then applied to the treatment of underflow
    and overflow in b-tree organisation.
