adapting and addressing educational goals in the library
    at the austine school. school libraries and media centres vary
    widely in size, quality of service, atmosphere, and contents of
    collections. this disparity is due to differences in budgets,
    educational and administrative policies, architecture,
    curricula, and geography and population of the schools. austine
    school affords a good opportunity to observe those factors
    which make one situation unique, by reason of its specialised
    needs and available resources of space, money, personnel and
    materials. attempts to determine the most important points in
    suiting a school library's operation to the aims of deaf
    education, to illustrate how this is done at the austine school
    for hearing handicapped children, and to draw general
    conclusions about how a school's library can be sure of
    satisfying specialised needs in harmony with its academic
    programme.
