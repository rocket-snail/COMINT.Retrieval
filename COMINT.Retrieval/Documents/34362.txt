press documentation and micrography. discusses how
    micrography can be used to improve organisation, management and
    operation of documentation centres using press material. a wide
    variety of potential users exists for archives based on
    newspapers, and while such centres have problems in common
    caused by the nature of such materials, each has requirements
    of its own dictated by its own special functions. general
    topics only are considered here' the possibilities of
    micrography in conservation and storage, and how microforms can
    be used in disseminating information either in the form of
    press dossiers or data banks. in conclusion, discusses
    copyright restrictions as the main obstacle to expanding the
    use of micrography in this field.
