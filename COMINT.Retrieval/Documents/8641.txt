stability of a plasma sheet in time periodic magnetic
    fields the behaviour of a thin sheet of electrons in a time
    varying square wave magnetic field is investigated and it is
    shown that the growth of an initial disturbance in the first
    half period is entirely annulled in the second both the
    displacements and velocities returning to their initial
    values
