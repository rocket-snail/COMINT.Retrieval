a contribution to the theory of nonlinear systems a
    system of classification of nonlinear terminal networks is
    introduced and basic properties of various classes are
    established the system is such that each class in the sequence
    n contains as a member the class before it a general nonlinear
    network of class n is completely defined by its responses to a
    family of step functions with amplitudes ranging over all real
    values an explicit expression is developed for the response of
    a class n network to a specified input modes of realization and
    characterization of networks of class n are outlined and a
    procedure for determining the optimum filter of any class is ou
    indicated
