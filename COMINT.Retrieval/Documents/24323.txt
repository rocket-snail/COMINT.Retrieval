the distribution of temperature along a thin rod
    electrically heated in vacuo part time lag expressions obtained
    previously of february for the steady state temperature
    distribution are used to study the increase of temperature
    accompanying a small increase in heating current over a
    considerable region near the centre of the rod the temperature
    variation can be completely represented by a simple exponential
    law involving a single relaxation time whose magnitude can be
    readily calculated this method is compared with that based on
    the fourier expansion the latter can be adapted for general use
    by introducing an effective length to replace the actual length
    of the rod for a given temperature at the centre the relaxation
    time varies inversely as the ratio of surface to volume and is
    thus smaller for a ribbon filament than for one of circular
    cross section as observed by prescott and morrison vol
