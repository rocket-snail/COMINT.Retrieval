semifinite terminated electric wave filters intended for
    s use either as channel filters or to work between a finite
    resistance at one end and a very high or very low impedance at
    the other two design methods are presented one based on the
    equivalent image parameter filter the other on norton and
    darlingtons insertion loss procedure the minimum ratio of
    terminating resistances lies between and for most
    applications
