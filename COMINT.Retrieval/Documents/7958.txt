a comparison of the noise and random frequency and
    amplitude fluctuations in different types of oscillator the
    nature of the random fluctuation in the output is dependent on
    the form of feedback employed and the method by which the
    output amplitude is controlled the frequency band over which
    the output power is distributed depends however on the relative
    magnitudes of signal and noise in the circuit rather than on
    the particular circuit employed the conclusion is that an
    oscillator should be operated at as high a level as possible
    consistent with stability and constancy of the circuit
