solar flare and magnetic storm effects in cosmic ray
    intensity near the geomagnetic n pole phenomena observed during
    and following the solar flare of july are discussed if the
    observed increase in cosmic ray intensity was due to charged
    particles from the sun the trajectories must have been strongly
    affected by factors other than the geomagnetic field
