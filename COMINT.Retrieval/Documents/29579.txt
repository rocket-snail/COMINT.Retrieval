polarization of atmospheric pulses due to successive
    reflections from the ionosphere explanations are offered of the
    more complex patterns observed on a crossed loop cr tube
    direction finder for atmospherics in addition to the normal
    straight line display of an atmospheric pulse elliptic traces
    or groups of straight lines within a small angle are produced
    elliptic traces are explained by polarization at ionospheric
    reflection and groups by radiation from branch points in a
    nearly horizontal cloud to cloud lightning flash see also of
