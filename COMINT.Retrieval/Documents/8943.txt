effect of hydromagnetic waves in a dipole field on the
    longitudinal invariant hydromagnetic waves of period sec and
    amplitude at earth radii may cause a systematic lowering of
    mirror points with subsequent loss of particles in atmospheric
    collisions two models for electron density variation along a
    field line are investigated particle acceleration by the fermi
    process is dominated by particle loss at mirror points and it
    is suggested that only high frequency waves will give effective
    acceleration
