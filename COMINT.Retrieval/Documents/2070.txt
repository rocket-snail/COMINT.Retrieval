in service training courses for voluntary workers. in
    eastern slovakia from a total of more than 1,100 public
    libraries, about 950 are staffed by part-time librarians. they
    work on a voluntary basis mainly in the villages. on average
    50% are teachers from local schools. in spite of their
    dedication and hard work, the volunteers often lacked the
    necessary knowledge of librarianship and information science.
    for that reason, regulations, issued by the slovak ministry of
    culture in 1976, imposed the duty on district libraries to make
    provisions for in-service training of the said librarians,
    ranging from 8 to 24 hours per year. so far, the syllabuses of
    such short courses as well as teaching methods have varied
    considerably. in addition to the traditional lectures,
    discussions and role playing, for instance, are to be used more
    widely. more profound knowledge of both slovak and foreign
    literature (belles-lettres, fiction) and also a greater insight
    into the psychology of adults will no doubt, exercise
    favourable influence on the librarian's performance, which, in
    turn, will result in expansion of the local library and its
    services.
