an analysis of electron density variations in the f layer
    after sunset analysis of data obtained at kokubunji taking
    temperature variations into account and assuming a linear law
    for the rate of disappearance of electrons indicates that the
    nocturnal variation of electron density in the f layer is
    explained more satisfactorily by the attachment theory than by
    the recombination theory the corresponding temperature
    variations deduced are not satisfactory for the winter months
    for which other factors must be taken into account
