how can library effectiveness be measured?. examines the
    library literature which deals with measurement of library
    effectiveness. this is usually measured in terms of loan
    figures, but this method fails to take account of reference and
    information work, now of growing importance. effectiveness must
    be seen in relation to the library's aims. a manual for
    performance measures in public libraries was published in 1976
    by the american library association. for those libraries which
    actively promote materials to create demands, hamburg et al
    (1972) suggest the following tests for effectiveness' exposure
    counts, item use-days, exposure time. gore (1978) uses the
    holdings rate, availability rate, and performance rate, the
    latter measuring the percentage of required material available
    when wanted by user. it has been pointed out that because
    effectiveness is a composite concept its measurement is
    complex, but that relying on loan figures only is no longer
    necessary.
