an addition and improvement for data bases: sintex, a
    statistical tool. a description of an indexing system developed
    by the societe d'informatique europeene, designed to overcome
    the inherent limitations of data base communication caused by
    the heterogeneity of indexing techniques, material stored and
    interrogation languages. the principles behind sintex are
    explained, and batch and on-line applications outlined, showing
    how it could operate as an entirely automatic indexing system.
    eventually sintex should permit unrestricted indexing and
    natural language data base interrogation.
