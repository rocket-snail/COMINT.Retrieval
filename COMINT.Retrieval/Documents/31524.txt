illiteracy in the german federal republic. report on a
    conference, held by educationalists, sociologists and
    librarians in bremen, nov 80, on illiteracy among children and
    adults. recent campaigns against illiteracy abroad show results
    far in advance of those hitherto achieved in west germany.
    researchers must find out who the illiterate are and the best
    ways to reach them; some work is already being done by staff at
    adult education centres, penal institutions and the local
    press. problems of staff and money shortages must be overcome
    and beginners' reading books produced suitable for adults.
    librarians can help by working with schools and kindergartens
    to alleviate the fear of entering a library felt by many
    people; they can provide suitable media to help school
    teachers, adult education centres and the readers themselves
    and assist in media production by cooperating with authors and
    publishers.
