low distortion transistor audio oscillator design details
    of an oscillator operating at any one of the four frequencies
    and and including pnp junction transistors series resistors are
    used to stabilize emitter currents and a tungsten filament lamp
    to control amplitude maximum available output is v the low
    noise characteristics are ascribed to the very narrow operating
    bandwidth
