a measurement at ottawa of the change in height with
    lunar time of the e region of the ionosphere the method used by
    appleton and weekes to detect the lunar variation of height of
    the e region of the ionosphere has been used to determine the
    amplitude and phase of the lunar height variation at ottawa
    observations were made from october to december a sinusoidal
    variation of height of amplitude and period was observed the
    maximum height occurred about six hours after lunar transit
    this result differs in phase by six hours from that observed in
    cambridge in
