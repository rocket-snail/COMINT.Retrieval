computer storage and retrieval of generic chemical
    structures in patents. 3. chemical grammars and their role in
    the manipulation of chemical structures. a simple topological
    chemical grammar is developed, and its possible applications to
    the computer manipulation of chemical structures are discussed.
    the generative and recognitive capabilities of the grammar are
    illustrated by examples. concludes by identifying the role of
    such capabilities in a generic (markush) structure search
    system.
