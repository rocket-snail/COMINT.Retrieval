fast response high current thyratron power supplies for
    inductive loads several methods for energizing loads such as
    fields of large motor generators solenoids magnetic clutches
    and electromagnets are discussed including the half wave
    circuit with an optimum value of capacitance in parallel with
    the load this method provides the fastest response for the
    equipment required
