electrical fluctuation phenomena the possibility is
    discussed that fluctuation phenomena in insulting materials may
    have their origin in recombination fluctuations of the freed
    electrons with their positive residual charges the
    recombination fluctuations being related to the statistical
    density fluctuations of the solid and being amplified by the
    mechanism of electronic conduction
