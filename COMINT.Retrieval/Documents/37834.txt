ionization distribution in the f region the height
    distribution of ionization in the composite f region is
    calculated on the assumptions that the scale height ie the
    temperature increases and the recombination coefficient
    decreases with height in this region the recombination
    coefficient is assumed to vary in terms of the reduced height
    that is the height above f max measured in terms of the actual
    height as had been done earlier by ap mitra in making similar
    calculations the present assumption automatically takes into
    account the effect of rising temperature on the value of the
    recombination coefficient height distribution curves for high
    and low latitude stations are drawn for typical summer and
    winter conditions in the high atmosphere in the f region when
    the possible effect of ionospheric tidal drifts are taken into
    account the forms of the distribution curves and the separation
    between the f and f layers agree with those deduced from
    observations the results support the view that the f and f
    layers belong to a common bank of ionization produced by solar
    radiation
