vh radar echoes associated with atmospheric phenomena
    during observations with radar equipment at echoes were
    obtained which could not be attributed either to aurorae or to
    meteors the characteristics of these echoes suggest that they
    may be due to upward discharges from the troposphere to the
    ionosphere which may be triggered off by meteors
