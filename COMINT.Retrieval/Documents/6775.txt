oblique echoes from over dense meteor trails ray paths
    are computed for waves refracted by meteor trails curves are
    derived showing how the echo duration depends on the trail
    orientation these curves show that the sec law applies for
    overdense trails only if the plane of propagation contains the
    trail axis if not the effective secant exponent may be as small
    as the theory is in agreement with duration measurements of
    mckinley and mcnamera and gives results similar to the more
    complex wave solutions of keitel see of
