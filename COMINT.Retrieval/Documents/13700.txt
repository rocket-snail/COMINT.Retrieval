the transmission range of two circuit band pass filters
    particularly for large bandwidths graphical methods of
    calculation are developed which give results with accuracy
    adequate for practical purposes the methods are applicable to
    unsymmetrical and wide bandfilters and also to narrow band
    symmetrical filters
