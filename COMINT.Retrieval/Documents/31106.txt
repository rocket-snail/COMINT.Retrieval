information technology and the science of information. in
    dealing with theories of information rather than of
    documentation, one needs to use the same logarithmic measures
    in information retrieval as are used in the analysis of the
    internal information processes of the computer. one would then
    be dealing with information objectively throughout, rather than
    a mix of objective and subjective measures. information 2per
    se1 is an empty concept. man needs to learn how to relate
    information more directly to knowledge, as a 1st step observing
    the growth of knowledge structures in compact fields of
    science. a firmer metaphysic for such studies is needed.
