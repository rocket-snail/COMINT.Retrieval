lunar variations in the ionosphere the global pattern of
    the observed lunar variations of the height and electron
    density of the region is summarized new analyses being
    presented for canberra brisbane and washington the height
    variation has an amplitude of maximum height occurs at lunar
    hours at moderate latitudes and at lunar hours at the
    geomagnetic equator the variation of has an amplitude of the
    maximum occurs at about lunar hours at moderate geomagnetic
    latitudes and at lunar hours near the geomagnetic equator
    theory is developed on the basis of a current system at a
    height of about the tidal winds needed to drive the current the
    potential distribution in the dynamo layer and the resulting
    periodic vertical drifts of ionization in the higher layers are
    calculated the lunar variations in are calculated taking into
    account probable height variations of recombination coefficient
    and ionization production rate the results are in good
    agreement with observations it is concluded that the amplitude
    of the lunar tidal wind near the layer is about times greater
    than that on the ground
