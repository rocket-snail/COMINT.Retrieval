shock waves in nonlinear transmission lines and their
    effect on parametric amplification the propagation of a
    periodic signal on a transmission line with a nonlinearity in
    the distributed capacitance is examined the signal is deformed
    during its propagation and em shock waves are generated the
    subsequent growth and decay of the shock are analysed
