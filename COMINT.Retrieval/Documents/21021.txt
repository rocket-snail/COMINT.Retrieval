theory of electromagnetic resonators of almost conical
    shape a mathematical investigation is carried out of
    oscillations in a resonator formed by a spheroid and a confocal
    two sheet hyperboloid for the case of a small ratio between the
    focal distance and the wave length perturbation theory is
    modified to take into account the large deviation of the field
    from that in a resonator formed by a sphere and two coaxial
    cones
