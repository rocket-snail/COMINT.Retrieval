the libraries go to sea. the concept of the 'workplace'
    library-a swedish advance-has attracted much attention in
    recent years. results, however, have been of variable equality
    and only in a few local authorities has it been possible to
    demonstrate a firmly established operation strongly anchored in
    the workplaces. one sector of the swedish labour market,
    however, has for many years enjoyed a smoothly functioning
    public library service. the swedish seamen's library serves the
    people working in the swedish merchant fleet. books from the
    library are to be found on almost all sweden's merchant ships,
    above all those on the ocean routes.
