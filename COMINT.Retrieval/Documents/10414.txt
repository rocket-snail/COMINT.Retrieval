considerations of photoemissive energy converters the
    efficiency of a o solar energy converter consisting of a
    emitter and an ag collector is calculated taking into account
    the initial velocities of the photoelectrons but ignoring space
    charge efficiencies between and are obtained for output
    voltages between and the efficiency increases as the percentage
    of blue and ultraviolet radiation in the source is increased to
    minimize space charge effects the emitter collector spacing
    must be of the order of or less
