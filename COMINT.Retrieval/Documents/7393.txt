a method of measuring the potential distribution in a
    cylindrical rf cavity containing plasma an ion beam is directed
    through the plasma and the position velocity and direction of
    the beam at the points of entry and exit are determined by
    varying the input parameter the potential of a particular point
    inside the plasma can be computed
