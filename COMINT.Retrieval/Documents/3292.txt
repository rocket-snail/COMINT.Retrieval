vital needs of libraries. for years now libraries and
    librarians in bulgaria have been following the example of their
    soviet counterparts in the organisation of library and
    information services. targets for bulgaria's economic growth,
    technological advancement and the population's higher living
    standard in the 1980s make the significance of soviet
    literature and periodicals still more obvious. concentrating
    upon concrete tasks and problems in their area, librarians must
    supply their readers and others working in local industries,
    research institutes, schools and colleges with relevant
    information. soviet sources, such as technical periodicals have
    been most useful in the past and will continue to be in the
    future. librarians can rely upon assistance given by the staff
    at the house of soviet science and culture in sofia.
    partnerships with soviet libraries have also proven valuable.
    some ventures from the pleven region (northern bulgaria) are
    given as examples of successful promotion of sovi et literature
    and experience in librarianship among the bulgarian
    public.
