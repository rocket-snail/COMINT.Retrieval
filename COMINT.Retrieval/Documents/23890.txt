on the faithful reproduction of the flat top of a pulse
    in a high fidelity pulse amplifier an experimental verification
    is reported of analysis presented previously it was
    demonstrated that the anode current may sag appreciably if the
    time constants of the cathode and screen grid circuits are not
    properly chosen
