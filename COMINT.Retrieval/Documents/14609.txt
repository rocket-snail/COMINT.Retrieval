the mechanism of subharmonic generation in a feedback
    system analysis is given for nonlinear feedback systems using
    the description function method subharmonics are produced as a
    result of mu modification of the response of the nonlinear
    element by the input signal conditions are derived for the
    absence of subharmonic oscillations theoretical and
    experimental results for a particular unit with an
    approximately cubic characteristic are in agreement
