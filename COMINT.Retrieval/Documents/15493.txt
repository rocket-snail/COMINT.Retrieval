improving nasa's technology transfer process through
    increasing screening and evaluation in the information
    dissemination program. the current status of nasa's technology
    transfer system can be improved if the technology transfer
    process is better understood. this understanding will only be
    gained if a detailed knowledge about factors generally
    influencing technology transfer is developed, and particularly
    those factors affecting technology transfer from government r
    and d agencies to industry. secondary utilisation of aerospace
    technology is made more difficult because it depends on a
    transfer process which crosses established organisational lines
    of authority and which is outside well understood patterns of
    technical applications. report not available from ntis.
