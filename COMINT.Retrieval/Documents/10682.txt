    family welfare association approach to the organisation and
    exploitation of its information resources relating to handicap.
    the information service is run by a social worker who deals
    with requests from the public and is often able to probe more
    deeply into needs expressed in an apparently simple request for
    information. the information files are highly confidential and
    growing substantially with input from fwa and local authority
    social workers.
