bibliographical control' a british view. a familiar and
    continuing problem in uk libraries is the underutilisation of
    microform holdings, bibliographic information for which is not
    integrated in the library catalogue. discusses this in the
    light of the appearance and growth of cooperative regional
    networks; suggests that the emerging system may form the base
    for the manipulation and sharing of full microform analytics;
    and offers some provocative comments on recent us efforts
    toward providing microforms with full bibliographic
    information.
