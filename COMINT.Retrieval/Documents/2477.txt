investigation of electromagnetic waves guided by helical
    conductors full theoretical analysis of the propagation of em
    waves along helical conductors shorter versions of parts of the
    paper hve previously been abstracted the continuous cylinder
    approximation and of gives a solution in good agreement with
    experimental results at frequencies sufficiently low and with
    the action of a narrow beam travelling wave valve the second
    method of analysis of based on the infinitely thin wire concept
    leads to difficulties in calculation but has more general
    application and is apparently correct to the second order of
    approximation its application to delay lines is illustrated
    results obtained by the two methods are compared of and
    discussed with reference to experimental measurements
