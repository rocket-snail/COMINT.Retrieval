multilayer absorbers for electromagnetic waves the
    absorbing power of structures is discussed which consist of two
    or more layers of loss free dielectric and thin resistive
    material arranged alternately the reflection coefficients are
    calculated for a number of such structures which are treated as
    resonance absorbers
