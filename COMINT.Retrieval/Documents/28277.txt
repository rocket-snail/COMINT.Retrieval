group height calculations in the presence of the earths
    magnetic field a method of obtaining a theoretical curve
    avoiding direct numerical integration is described it is based
    on integral formulae involving the derivative of height with
    respect to electron density and obtained as special cases of
    the gauss christoffel quadrature formulae involving the
    derivative of height with respect to electron density and
    obtained as special cases of the gauss christoffel quadrature
    formula of and of july application to linear parabolic cosine
    and arc cosine distribution is illustrated and results are
    compared with exact calculations and of shinn and whale and of
    may shinn a different method is described for the case of layer
    penetration
