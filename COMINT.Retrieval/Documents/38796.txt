maxwells equations for three layered media and their
    application to the theory of the movement of a magnetic storm
    solutions of the characteristic equations for ideal and for
    real three layered media are given application is made to
    discussion of the characteristics of the marginal layers and
    calculation of the velocity of propagation of the elements of a
    magnetic storm other possible applications of the theory given
    are noted
