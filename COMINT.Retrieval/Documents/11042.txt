a variable atmospheric density model from satellite
    accelerations an empirical expression is derived which relates
    atmospheric density and scale height h to satellite orbital
    elements and solar rf noise flux f from this can be obtained as
    a function of f height and solar zenith angle tables of and are
    given for and for two values of f and
