microwave harmonic generator capable of frequencies in
    excess of the device contains argon at atmospheres which
    reduces the are produced between cathode and anode to a small
    cathode spot the microwave signal driving the arc is a
    continuous wave of about an output of at the harmonic of the
    drive input is obtained
