on the world wide distribution of the coefficients a and
    b in the relation where sunspot number are separated into
    components which are constant and those which vary diurnally
    and annually see of examination of these components for
    stations shows a geomagnetic latitude control of the constant
    component while there is no significant difference between
    control by geomagnetic or geographic latitude for the varying
    components
