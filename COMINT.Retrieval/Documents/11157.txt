investigation of the ionizing effect in the e layer near
    sunrise virtual height time records for signals show a sudden
    decrease in virtual height around ground sunrise analysis for
    the period jan dec shows that the difference between time of
    occurrence of the sunrise drop and sun rise at the reflection
    level is constant and independent of season absorption is
    considered the most likely cause of this effect calculations of
    absorption coefficients for o n and o give results of the right
    order of magnitude in the case of only ionization of o could be
    caused by ultraviolet radiation of
