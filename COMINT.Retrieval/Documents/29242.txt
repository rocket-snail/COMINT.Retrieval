problems in establishing a name authority file for
    nigerian authors. establishing name authority files in such
    multilingual nations as nigeria is complicated by the existence
    of some 400 languages and dialects, although only about 15% of
    these have been written or used in publications; english is
    used as the official language and the medium of
    intercommunication between tribes. traditionally, nigerians
    have been known by their given names derived from 4 categories'
    circumstance of birth, religion of the family clan, profession
    of the family, and history of previous births. with the
    influence of the english and other europeans, elements of islam
    and christianity have been introduced into the naming system.
