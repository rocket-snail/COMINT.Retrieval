coherent informational energy and entropy. aiming to
    provide a common theoretical foundation for all known
    bibliometric laws, starts from a systemic view of the
    information transfer process and likens it to a physical
    diffusion process, in particular the conduction of heat in
    solids. the interest potential of new authors is equivalent to
    temperature. the model also allows for new definitions of
    informational energy and entropy, corresponding to the physical
    definitions. discusses the possibility of introducing
    information into concrete thermodynamic systems
    analysis.
