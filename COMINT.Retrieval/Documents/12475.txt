coincidence methods and the two-level concept.
    coincidence methods are applied to investigations into rank
    distribution in the report literature of the international
    nuclear information system (inis) and a 2-level concept used
    for discussion of results in the present and previous
    investigations. transitions between macro and micro information
    levels, with reference to constant forms of communication, are
    compared with each other as well as transitions between
    different forms of communication at constant levels. the
    disappearance of the 'information avalanche' for the highly
    specialised information scientist, the greater effectivity of
    report literature as compared with periodical literature in the
    fields of nuclear research and the noncompatibility of macro
    and micro information levels can be quantitatively confirmed.
    the question remains, how microlevel distribution can be
    changed into macrolevel distribution.
