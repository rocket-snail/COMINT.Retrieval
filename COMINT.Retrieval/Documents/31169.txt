documentation on the ivory coast. summary of research
    carried out in 1981 by the ivory coast national university.
    preliminary details are given of the political and economic
    situation of the ivory coast, the most developed of the former
    african colonies. a detailed investigation of information
    services was effected to establish whether information
    provision produced development, or resulted from it. details
    are given of resources and services, national and international
    network links, expenditure, and government information policy.
    formal and informal communication channels are analysed with
    particular reference to the national library and national
    archives, where the excellence of the collections is not fully
    exploited because of inadequate resources, as compared to the
    electrical energy information centre, which is financially well
    supported. recommendations for future policy include
    cooperation with other african states, the elaboration of a
    coherent national information policy, the imp osition of
    charges for information services, and the development of
    training programmes in information use. the evidence, it is
    concluded, shows that documentation is a product of
    development.
