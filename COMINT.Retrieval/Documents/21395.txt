the transient response of rf and if filters to a wave
    packet summary only analysis based on fourier integral
    transforms is applied to two particular circuits a single stage
    of tuned anode coupling a single stage of tuned transformer
    coupling the analysis is valid for circuits of any bandwidth
    particular attention is paid to the build up time of a
    transient which for a band pass network is usually assumed to
    be inversely proportional to the network bandwidth the analysis
    shows that this assumption is correct for the tuned anode
    coupling circuit if the ratio of the half bandwidth to the
    resonance frequency is less than unity for the tuned
    transformer circuit however the rule does not hold good since
    for a given bandwidth there are many possible transfer
    impedances and hence transient responses the rule should
    therefore only be applied to circuits which its application is
    shown to be legitimate
