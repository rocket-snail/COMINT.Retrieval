the decay of the space charges in intermittent discharges
    in neon and argon the influence of the gas pressure and
    electrode separation on the decay of the space charges is
    investigated experimentally the decay times for both neon and
    argon appear to be of the order of sec and are nearly
    proportional to the pressure over the range of measurement
    about possible explanations of these values are discussed and
    the various regions of the static characteristic are related to
    the functioning of counters and periodic discharges
