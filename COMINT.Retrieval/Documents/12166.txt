networks for which magnitude or phase angle of input
    impedance or transfer admittance remains constant as load
    varies the conditions are determined that must be satisfied by
    a network at constant frequency to obtain a particular
    variation of input impedance or transfer admittance when the
    load changes in a specified way results are tabulated for ten
    special cases
