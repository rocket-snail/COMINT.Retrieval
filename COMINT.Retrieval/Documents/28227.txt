when money is scarce cultural life must grow. interviews
    ingar beckman-hirschfeldt, chairman of the swedish public
    librarians' union (sff) in connection with a campaign organised
    by dik (documentation, information, culture), an umbrella
    organization of 8 associations, of which sff is a member. the
    campaign aims to put pressure on politicians up to the time of
    local and general elections in 1982 and demonstrate the
    consequences of cuts; a discussion book describing the present
    state of cultural institutions and stating alternatives which
    would give higher priority to culture is to be published.
    public opinion is to be mobilised and a cultural programme for
    dik drawn up. although no section of the campaign is aimed
    specifically at libraries, demand for a library law to ensure
    reasonable and uniform standards will be made. cuts in cultural
    services are unacceptable to dik and librarians are urged not
    to cooperate in suggesting cuts in services and manpower. sff
    expects little from the public library commission, on which it
    is not represented.
