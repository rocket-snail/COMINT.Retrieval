periodic fading of medium wave radio signals slow fading
    was found to correspond to interference between paths and
    between paths rapid fading to interference between paths the
    values of the vertical drift velocity of the layer calculated
    on the basis of observations of the three types of interference
    at an indian station for the period between and hours were and
    respectively ground wave fading indicates a drift velocity
    decreases during the morning depth of fading also decreases due
    to increasing d layer absorption
