winds in the ionospheric regions a model for the region
    between and height is constructed from considerations of the
    temperature gradients and the observed wind velocities
    according to this model the wind is south west in the e and f
    regions and north east or east in the f region its velocity
    increases from at km to at there is a seasonal variation in the
    magnitude of the velocity but the model does not involve any
    diurnal or seasonal changes of direction such as have been
    reported by observers
