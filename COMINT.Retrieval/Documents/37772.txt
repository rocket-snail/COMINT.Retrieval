some properties of dielectrics with high permittivity
    analysis shows that for a conductor surrounded by a dielectric
    of sufficiently high permittivity the depth of penetration of
    hf current is dependent only on the constants of the dielectric
    formulae are derived for solid and for hollow dielectric
    cylinders and spheres subjected to an alternating electric
    field expressing the conditions under which the amplitude of
    oscillation of the bound electrons becomes infinite the results
    can be stated in terms of characteristic radii for a given
    material and frequency
