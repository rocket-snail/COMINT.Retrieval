on asymptotic series fo functions occurring in the theory
    of diffraction of waves by wedges an asymptotic expansion of
    the integral expression for diffraction by a wedge at distances
    large compared with is obtained as the sum of a fresnel
    integral as leading term and an asymptotic series of inverse
    powers of the distance for small values of the distance the
    expansion takes the form of a series involving bessel
    functions
