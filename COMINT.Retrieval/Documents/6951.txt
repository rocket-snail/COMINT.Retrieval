future possibilities for productive reading. 3 series of
    experiments were undertaken in an attempt to determine the
    connection between the speed of reading and the understanding
    of what is read. results showed that speed and understanding do
    not change in parallel. up to a critical point they follow each
    other; thereafter further increases in speed are accompanied by
    decreases in understanding. this critical point can be used as
    an index of reading ability for any given reader. libraries
    should promote the use of more productive reading to encourage
    a more efficient use of their resources.
