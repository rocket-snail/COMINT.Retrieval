indexing exhaustivity and the computation of similarity
    matrices. some of the automatic classification procedures used
    in information retrieval derive clusters of documents from an
    intermediate similarity matrix, the computation of which
    involves comparing each of the documents in the collection with
    all of the others. it has recently been suggested that many of
    these comparisons, specifically those between documents having
    no terms in common, may be avoided by means of the use of an
    inverted file to the document collection. it is shown that the
    approach will effect reductions in the number of interdocument
    comparisons only if the documents are each indexed by a limited
    number of indexing terms; if exhaustive indexing is used, many
    document pairs will be compared several times over and the
    computation will be greater than when conventional approaches
    are used to generate the similarity matrix.
