but...it could be better!': towards a third edition of
    the handbook of librarianship and documentation.i n reply to
    criticism of the 2nd edition of 2bibliotheek en documentatie'
    handboek ten dienste van de opleidingen1 (2libraries and
    documentation' a handbook for students1) published in dec 79,
    the editorial board point out the difficulty of producing a
    textbook to suit the many differing courses in librarianship in
    the netherlands. however, in the 3rd edition of the book, which
    is due for publication in spring 83, several chapters will be
    devoted to general aspects of librarianship, including the
    philosophy of librarianship. in addition, the new edition will
    contain more facts and examples to illustrate the theoretical
    aspects, and will be more readable.
