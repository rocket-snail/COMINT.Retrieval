a note on the use of the titanates as thermoelectric
    transducers approximate calculations for a solid solution of
    indicate that it would not be useful as a thermoelectric
    transducer it seems that if materials could be produced with
    high permittivity and high temperature coefficient of
    permittivity but independent of field strength a transducer
    with an efficiency comparable to that of a steam engine could
    be developed
