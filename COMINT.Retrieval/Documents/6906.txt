the undergraduate library: lamont and the american
    experience. this review of the literature on undergraduate
    libraries, the historical context from which they arose, and
    their status at the end of the 70s points out that a long
    tradition of lack of concern for undergraduate bibliographical
    needs was broken dramatically in 1949 by the construction of
    lamont library, the harvard undergraduate facility. although
    designed to solve problems unique to harvard, lamont was an
    exemplary construction that soon captured the imagination of
    the academic library world. it became the model for a rash of
    new libraries aimed at satisfying 'unique' undergraduate needs.
    these libraries proliferated during the 50s and 60s, a period
    of accelerated growth in academe. by the 70s, however, the
    general financial retrenchment of american colleges and
    universities had virtually halted new construction. further,
    the thesis that presumed the needs of undergraduates to be
    somehow 'different', as well as the advisabi lity of facilities
    effectively segregating them from the rest of the academic
    community, came under attack in the professional literature.
    few undergraduate libraries were built during this period and
    several were closed or converted to other uses. report not
