towards an integrated hospital information system-the
    'sufficiency matrix': a tool for change, control and
    development of hospital information systems. this systems
    analysis project describes an important study project basic to
    the hospital information system at the university of illinois
    hospital. the intent of the project was to make explicit the
    formal and informal exchanges of data that occur for the
    internal and external transmittal of information. an additional
    intent was to identify secondary and tertiary information users
    as well as those involved in each transaction which created
    information.
