baileys theory of sunspot noise a discussion of the
    exchange of energy between the drifting electrons and the wave
    radiated from a transient disturbance is given which is more
    general than baileys of and which shows that amplification can
    occur under certain conditions consideration of a sunspot model
    having axial symmetry leads to the conclusion that
    amplification will occur only in exceptional regions
