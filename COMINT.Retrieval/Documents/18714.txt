electromagnetic waves in nearly periodic structures the
    theory of simple harmonic electromagnetic waves in a nearly
    periodic structure of the type used in linear accelerators is
    discussed by an expansion in a series of appropriately defined
    transmission modes of the field in a unit cell of the structure
    the possibility of the expansion being assumed it is shown that
    the coefficients can be expressed as integrals of the field
    over the input or output apertures of the cell the modification
    to the corresponding solution in the strictly periodic
    structure can be calculated by perturbation theory in the first
    approximation the structure can be represented by a series of
    four terminal networks and the voltages and currents in these
    can be defined in such a way that the relevant parameters vary
    smoothly in the neighbourhood of resonance
