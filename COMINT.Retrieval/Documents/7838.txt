developing databases for online information retrieval.
    the emergence of on-line data bases represents a shift from
    providing a physical entity, a book or an article, to the more
    abstract concept of providing or transferring information. the
    role of the data base developer/analyst in that shift is that
    of an information retrieval 'cataloguer' responsible for
    determining the access points supported by the data base's
    contents, much as a traditional library cataloguer defines,
    describes, and classifies the intellectual content of a book
    and 'maps' it into the library's card catalogue. describing the
    tasks required in developing a data base for on-line searching
    is the purpose of this paper.
