high latitude ionospheric observations using
    extraterrestrial radio waves a preliminary account is given of
    observations made at college alaska over a two month period in
    the spring of the effect of the ionosphere on the reception of
    cosmic radiation at strong absorption of the diffuse background
    is most common at midday and least common during late evening
    it is correlated with no echo conditions and with variations of
    the geomagnetic field observations on localized radio sources
    indicate that scintillations are commoner in alaska than in
    england scintillations were observed whenever marked absorption
    occurred during transit of the localized source through the
    aerial beam this indicates that the lateral distribution of
    ionization during periods of absorption is nonuniform study of
    the scintillations shoud provide information about
    irregularities in the ionosphere
