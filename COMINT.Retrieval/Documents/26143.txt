the faraday fading of radio waves from an artificial
    satellite faraday fading of signals from an artificial
    satellite is analysed in terms of the difference between the
    doppler shifts of the ordinary and extraordinary components in
    the ionosphere a procedure is outlined for determining the
    vertical distribution of electron density in the upper
    ionosphere explanations are given forthe apparently excessive
    values of electron content yielded by measurements of faraday
    fading and for the observation that the rate of faraday fading
    is not exactly inversely proportional to the square of the wave
    frequency
