german mediaeval manuscripts from monastery libraries in
    bavaria. there are about 1,350 german mediaeval manuscripts,
    known today as 2codices germanici monacenses, 1in the bavarian
    state library, about 2/3 of which came to munich through the
    secularisation of the monasteries. the german codices form only
    about 4% of all the monastic collections of manuscripts, which
    date mostly from the 15th century. detailed descriptions are
    given of stocks from' the putrich monastery, munich; tegernsee;
    rebdorf; st. emmeran in regensburg; and the augustine and
    franciscan monasteries in munich. subject contents include the
    rules of the orders, prayer and meditation, didactic fables,
    chronicles, legal material and secular literature, all of
    interest to an international lay public. many questions about
    manuscript origins still remain open.
