three phase transductor circuits for magnetic amplifiers
    various transductor connections for phase operation are
    described a element circuit with separate excitation and a
    element circuit with auto excitation are discussed in detail a
    theoretical and experimental comparison is made between single
    phase and phase circuits the latter should be used where
    balanced loading of the supply is sufficiently desirable to
    compensate for the increased circuit complexity
