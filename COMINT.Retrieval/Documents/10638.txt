some notes on the properties and manufacture of
    piezoelectric quartz crystals the frequency stability
    temperature coefficient and activity of quartz resonators are
    discussed and the relation between these properties n and the
    oscillation frequency of a circuit including the crystal is
    examined the performance of some typical units is shown
    graphically
