the solar flare type variation in geomagnetic field and
    the integrated electrical conductivity of the ionosphere part
    effect of f layer analysis of mutual inductance effects between
    different ionosphere layers shows that as regards the effect of
    layer currents on the geomagnetic field a single layer can be
    assumed the conductivity of which is equal to that of the
    various layers integrated vertically throughout the whole
    conductive region the previous estimate of about emu for the
    integrated conductivity of the whole ionosphere is thus
    confirmed part above
