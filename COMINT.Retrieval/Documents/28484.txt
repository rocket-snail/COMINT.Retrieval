public relations in the 1980s. a discourse on likely
    future trends in public libraries and public relations. no
    library can achieve its goals if it is not conscious of its
    public functions, and a varied public relations programme,
    enthusiastically presented can do much to gain total support
    for, and widespread interest in, the library. in the future
    public relations will be an important management function, more
    cost-oriented, better publicised, slicker and more
    professional, and there will be better education for public
    relations. discusses what the librarian can do to involve
    him/herself more in the public relations programme.
