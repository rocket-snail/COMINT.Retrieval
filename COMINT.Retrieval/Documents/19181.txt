iranian health science libraries in revolution. account
    of the impact of the iranian revolution on health science
    libraries, with brief description of their pre-revolutionary
    status. the overall effect of the revolution has been mixed,
    and whilst health science librarians are encouraged by evidence
    of increased democracy in library management, they were
    disappointed by budget cuts and personnel freezes. however,
    since the departure of the monarchy, they hope for a more
    encouraging situation in the future.
