the international year of the handicapped and the
    libraries. libraries in east germany provide many services for
    handicapped people and special efforts were made to improve
    services in 1981. increased assistance was provided for
    patients' libraries and trade union libraries in hospitals,
    clinics and social welfare facilities. the use of bibliotherapy
    for treating mental illness is increasing. public libraries
    stock large print books provided by the central library for the
    blind in leipzig. library staff and volunteers visit housebound
    readers and special facilities are provided in the library for
    the physically handicapped. public libraries provide books for
    use in sheltered workshops, homes, special schools and
    rehabilitation centres. some handicapped people work in
    libraries as a form of rehabilitation and library staff are
    given training on the problems of handicap. cooperation between
    librarians and medical authorities is essential in this
    sphere.
