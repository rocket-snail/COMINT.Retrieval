at the beginning of the title service for school
    libraries. since 1979 a project group of the deutsche
    bibliotheksinstitut (german library institute) committee on
    school libraries has been involved in preparatory work towards
    a book reviewing service specifically for school libraries. the
    service aims to cover all books other than textbooks which are
    suitable for use by teachers and pupils in educational or
    leisure pursuits. the material covered will cater for all
    children and young people at general or vocational schools. a
    preliminary survey was made of schools, libraries and
    educational institutes in order to ascertain requirements. 1
    pilot edition containing 200 reviews will appear in feb/mar 82,
    a 2nd edition is planned for the autumn. if the project is
    realised, it will ultimately cover 2,000 titles a year.
