initial transients in some special passive networks with
    amplitude and frequency modulation it is shown that for
    multistage selective circuits there is an optimum coupling for
    which the output corresponding to unit step input is aperiodic
    and free from overshoot the performance of two frequency shift
    circuits is studied and the existence of an optimum ratio of
    shift to keying frequency is demonstrated a formula is derived
    for calculating distortion factor for two circuit band pass
    filters with
