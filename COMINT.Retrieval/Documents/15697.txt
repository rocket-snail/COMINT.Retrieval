the use of printed cards of the all-union book chamber in
    an academic library. 4 years ago the regional library of the
    voronezh state university introduced a new method of using the
    printed cards of the all-union book chamber. in the past, the
    library staff had to fill in 7 full sets of the cards, despite
    the fact that only 20-30% of the cards were actually used in
    catalogues. instead of full sets the library now uses serial
    sets. depending on the subject of the catalogued document (for
    example literature on humanities is included in 3 catalogues),
    1-8 copies of the serial set cards are filled in. their use
    resulted in a considerable financial saving and in reduced
    labour consumption. the processing of the printed cards is
    described.
