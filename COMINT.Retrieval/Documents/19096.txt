the development of the university library' tasks,
    structure and organisation. contribution to an issue devoted to
    the german librarians conference at regensburg, 9-13 june 81.
    regensburg university, founded in 1964, has over 10,000
    students studying a wide range of subjects. the library,
    stocking over a million volumes, comprises a central library
    and 11 subject libraries, employing 215 staff. all stock,
    whether open access or in stacks, is accessible to all
    university members. the stock contains a large proportion of
    modern material; older works are bought only when essential for
    certain disciplines. in 1980 the budget for book purchase and
    binding totalled 63 million dm. alphabetical, keyword and
    classified location catalogues are provided and stocks are also
    entered in the union catalogue for all the new bavarian
    universities. it is hoped that stocks of older material can be
    enlarged through stack expansion and that increasing demands
    for all kinds of material can be met through further
    inter-university cooperation.
