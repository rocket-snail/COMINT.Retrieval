recent advances in potted and printed circuits the
    various potting resins are described in relation to the
    variation of properties with different proportions of hardener
    and the effects on the parameters of the potted components the
    causes of failure of potted circuits are discussed design
    problems in the use of printed circuits are examined with
    particular reference to questions of conductor thickness and
    spacing a method of sealing printed circuits by a thin
    polysulphide rubber layer which is sprayed or brushed on is
    described
