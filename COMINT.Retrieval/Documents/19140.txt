microwave and metre wave radiation from the positive
    column of a gas discharge radiation intensity measurements were
    made at and on a ne discharge by inserting the ps positive
    column in a resonant cavity and comparing the cavity output
    with that of a known noise source the rf power per unit
    bandwidth is expressed in terms of where is boltzmanns constant
    and i the equivalent noise temperature and is comparable with
    the temperature of the electrons in the discharge the departure
    of from the value corresponding to a maxwell or druyvesteyn
    electron velocity distribution is investigated
