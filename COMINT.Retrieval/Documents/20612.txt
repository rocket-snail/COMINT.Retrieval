public music libraries-a statistical point of view. at
    the end of mar 79 the 79/80 rapid statistics concerning public
    libraries in west germany were published. they are published
    annually by the german library institute but from 1982 the
    'deutsche bibliotheksstatistik dbs' will be publishing a
    complete set of statistics. the section concerning public music
    libraries in the current statistics shows that there are 54 of
    them and that 2 more are planned. the statistics concerning
    stock are difficult to evaluate as some libraries now have new
    methods of calculating stock or others have their stock
    included in central libraries. however, taking this into
    consideration there has been an increase in stock of about 2.9%
    and the rate of borrowing has risen by 6.4%. of the 40
    libraries which supplied figures concerning expenditure 1/3 had
    no rise in their budget or even had cuts of between -7% and
    -24%. although the remaining 2/3 had a budget rise the total
    drop in expenditure was 2.1%.
