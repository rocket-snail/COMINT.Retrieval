on the theory of the acousto electric effect when an
    acoustic wave passes through an insulated solid it gives rise
    to an electric field in the direction of propagation the
    influence on this phenomenon of thermal lattice vibrations at
    temperatures above the debye temperature is investigated
    theoretically the calculations indicate that the field is
    proportional to both the intensity and frequency of the
    acoustic wave the effect is so small that it would not
    generally be observable in cu but is larger by several orders
    of magnitude in ge
