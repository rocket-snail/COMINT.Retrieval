on user studies and information needs. apart from
    information retrieval there is virtually no other area of
    information which has occasioned as much research effort and
    writing as 'user studies'. within user studies the
    investigation of 'information needs' has been the subject of
    much debate and not little confusion. attempts to reduce the
    confusion by defining some concepts, and by proposing the basis
    for a theory of the motivations for information-seeking
    behaviour.
