interferometer observations of solar radiation at the
    distribution of brightness over the solar disk has been studied
    by observations at marcoussis subsequent to those reported
    previously of the sensitivity of the system was sufficient for
    reliable measurements of interference of magnitude down to the
    results confirm that at this frequency the suns apparent
    diameter is slightly greater than for the visible disk and limb
    brightening is present
