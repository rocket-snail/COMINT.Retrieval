correlation of magnetic auroral and ionospheric
    variations at saskatoon part the relations between magnetic
    auroral and ionospheric observations are summarized with
    reference to the occurrence of positive and negative magnetic
    bays auroral light associated with positive bays occurs at a
    higher geomagnetic latitude than that associated with negative
    bays the magnetic and auroral light variations are compared to
    martyns theory of the aurora if the latter is accepted the
    conclusion is reached that most aurora is caused by positively
    charged particles and that the conditions described for the
    early phase actually exist throughout most of a disturbance
