silicon pn junction power rectifiers and lightning
    protectors a method of preparing large area junction diodes is
    indicated in which donor eg or acceptor eg b impurities are
    diffused into high purity single crystals of si at temperatures
    above low resistivity surface layers are produced facilitating
    the application of contacts electrical characteristics are
    presented of a power rectifier and a lightning protector
    prepared by this method
