some magnetic properties of metals part properties of
    small systems of electrons a calculation is made of the
    magnetic properties of a system of electrons within a cylinder
    of very small radius with its axis parallel to the field
    direction the expressions obtained for magnetic susceptibility
    thermodynamic potential and specific heat contain a steady term
    which remains of significant magnitude at all temperatures
    together with terms periodic in the field which are significant
    only at very low temperatures the influence of electron spin is
    discussed similar calculations are made for a small spherical
    system
