distributed amplifiers mutual inductance coupled type
    design procedure is outlined the problems of output voltage and
    output matching being considered in detail a method involving
    over running the valves is described for increasing gain and
    output while maintaining the time delay constant when
    amplifying random pulses details are given of the construction
    and performance of two amplifiers having a useful bandwidth
    of
