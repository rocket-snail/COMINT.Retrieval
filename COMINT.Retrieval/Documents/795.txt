closed catalogs and split files' a funny thing happened
    on the way to the form. discusses problems in converting
    catalogues to aacr2, suggesting alternative methods of
    effecting the changeover. many libraries are closing or
    freezing their card catalogues in the usa and moving to a com,
    interim card or on-line catalogue. if all aacr2 changes are not
    made as they occur split files are inevitable which leads to
    poor precision and recall as users are reluctant to search in
    more than 1 place.
