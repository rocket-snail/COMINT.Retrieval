convex hulls of finite sets of poin ts in two and three
    dimensions the convex hulls of sets of n poin ts in two and
    three dimensions can be determined with o(n log n) operations.
    the presented algorithms use the "divide and conquer" technique
    and recursively apply a merge procedure for two nonin
    tersecting convex hulls. since any convex hull algorithm
    requires at least o(n log n) operations, the time complexity of
    the proposed algorithms is optimal within a multiplicative
    constant. february, 1977 preparata, f. p. hong, s. j.
