    college libraries can put their unmanageably overweight serials
    budget on a sensible diet by limiting new subscriptions;
    analysing the serials collection; perhaps developing a serials
    collection based on the book collection profile; and then
    developing a sensible serials collection policy with the
    long-term future in mind.
