transistor circuits for a digital computer the
    requirements of amplifiers used for pulse regeneration are
    considered and blocking oscillators and regenerative amplifiers
    employing transistors suitable for reshaping and retiming
    pulses in a digital computer with a digit rate are described
    some details of their practical application are given
