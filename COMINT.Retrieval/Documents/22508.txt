dc amplifiers with negative feedback methods are
    described for automatically compensating the input impedance of
    current amplifiers or the input admittance of voltage
    amplifiers details are given of the design and performance of
    several circuits for measurement purposes in which very high
    input impedance with low capacitance is achieved
