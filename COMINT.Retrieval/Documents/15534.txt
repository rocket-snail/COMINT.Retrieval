thermoelectric phenomena in strong magnetic fields in
    metals possessing various mermi surfaces the asymptotic
    variation of the thermoelectric force peltier and thomson
    coefficients for metals with closed fermi surfaces and open
    surfaces of the corrugated cylinder and space net types is
    investigated on the basis of the quasiclassical theory of
    kinetic phenomena
