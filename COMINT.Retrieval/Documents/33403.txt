fear of talking' which students in the academic library
    ask librarians for help?. for many library users, the librarian
    is an integral part of any search strategy. an observational
    study was conducted to explore the possible effects of 1
    communication variable, communication apprehension (ca), the
    fear of talking, on the user's decision to search a library
    independently or with the librarian's assistance. it was found
    that respondents, regardless of ca level, behaved similarly in
    searching a library when measured in terms of initial step,
    number of steps, and length of search time. ca was eliminated
    as a variable influencing the initiation of an interaction with
    a librarian. further research is needed to determine its
    possible effects once that interaction has begun.
