periodicals in our libraries. periodicals are valuable in
    every library since they are topical material and attract new
    readers who might not otherwise use the library. periodical
    selection is important; a list is included of 42 german
    language periodicals on all subjects, for adults and children,
    which could be considered suitable for a roman catholic parish
    library. periodical selection by a team is essential; the team
    could include the priest, the parish council and
    representatives from other interested bodies. selection should
    take particular community interests into account but excessive
    specialisation should be avoided. finance is always a problem;
    some individual readers might be willing to help. it is
    important to publicise the library's periodical stocks.
