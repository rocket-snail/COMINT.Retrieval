global hydromagnetic wave ducts in the exosphere magnetic
    field perturbations originating from a high altitude explosion
    have been observed at a number of stations an analysis of
    results indicates that hydromagnetic waves at high altitudes
    travel along great circle paths in ducts which are concentric
    shells about the earth slow and fast signals are identified
    respectively with transverse and longitudinal hydromagnetic
    wave modes
