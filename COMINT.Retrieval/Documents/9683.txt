dielectric changes of electroluminescent phosphor during
    illumination measurements were made of the dielectric
    properties of electro luminescent films composed as described
    previously above for different values of applied voltage at and
    for various wavelengths and intensities of illumination the
    dielectric constant depends markedly on the illumination the
    magnitude of the variations depending critically on the applied
    voltage the effect exhibits a maximum at about
