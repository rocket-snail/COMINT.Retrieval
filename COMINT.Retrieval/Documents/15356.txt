the american film institute and the library of congress'
    a twelve-year perspective. the afi was created in 1967 by the
    us national foundation on the arts and humanities as a private,
    non-profit, non-governmental institution to serve the public
    interest. in 1968 it entered into a collaborative agreement
    with the library of congress, whereby lc would expand
    established programmes to acquire, preserve and retain motion
    pictures for the national collection of motion pictures. the
    afi allocated funds to lc to support these activities and to
    aid its inspection, handling, cataloguing, preserving and
    storing of films. the arrangement has permitted the evolution
    of a practical working relationship whereby each institution
    does what it is best suited to. describes in detail the work of
    both bodies, individually and in collaboration.
