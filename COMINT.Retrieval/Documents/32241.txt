analysis and coding of generic chemical formulae in
    chemical patents. presents a formal linguistic approach to the
    representation of generic chemical formulae in chemical
    patents, within the context of use of the alwin line-formula
    notation (an algorithmic version of the wiswesser line
    notation). the objective of the representation is to permit
    searches for specific structures and for substructures which
    are included within the generic expression. the relevance of
    pattern analysis methods to this problem is highlighted and
    preliminary suggestions on algorithm development are put
    forward.
