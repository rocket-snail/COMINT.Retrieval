thermal emission from the solar corona in the wavelength
    range cm calculations are made of the suns radiation for
    various models of the corona a method is developed for
    determining the temperature of the corona from the measured
    intensity distribution over the solar disk radiation from the
    corona may introduce appreciable irregularities in the
    intensity distribution failure to take account of deviations
    from radial symmetry may lead to incorrect interpretation of
    results staniers conclusions of may be effected in this
    way
