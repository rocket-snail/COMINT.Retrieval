the structure of hydromagnetic sho k waves part one
    nonlinear hydromagnetic waves in a cold plasma waves in a quasi
    neutral gas consisting of ions and electrons are investigated
    neglecting collisions but not the inertial effects of the
    electric current the relation of these waves to hydromagnetic
    shock waves in low density plasmas is considered
