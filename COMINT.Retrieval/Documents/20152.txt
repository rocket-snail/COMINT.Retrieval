efficient and effective use of technical dictionaries and
    encyclopaedias. increasing involvement of bulgaria's
    institutions and individual scientists and experts in various
    international projects, has led to much higher demand for
    dictionaries, encyclopaedias and foreign reference
    publications. the author's postgraduate research in major
    scientific, technical and other special libraries in sofia has
    shown great care has been taken in the continuous updating of
    the relevant collections. the publications are, at least
    partly, available to the users in open access departments
    and/or in specialised reading rooms, as in the cyril and
    methodius national library. nevertheless, it is desirable that
    the acquisition departments pay even closer attention to
    reference publications. compilation of a general catalogue of
    all reference publications in the capital's libraries would
    also be helpful. reedited every few years, or supplemented with
    amendments and appendices, such a catalogue would be an
    invaluable asset for the prospective computerised data bank of
    scientific terminology.
