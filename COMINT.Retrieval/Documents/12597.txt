when the national librarian again spoke his mind.
    comments on the annual report of the danish research library
    association (danmarks forskningsbiblioteksforenings) given by
    palle birkelund, the national librarian. danish research
    libraries are not given the support from the state in the
    economic crisis which they receive in sweden. he expressed
    fears that the proposed library act, far from creating unity
    within the danish library service, would emphasise the division
    between research libraries under the cultural ministry and
    those under the education ministry. he hoped that the cultural
    minister would not be unduly influenced by the danish library
    association when formulating the library act related to
    research libraries. instead of attacking them for lack of
    openness to the public the minister should see that economic
    barriers to their activities are removed.
