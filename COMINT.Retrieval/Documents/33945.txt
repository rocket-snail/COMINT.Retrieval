jobs and staffing requirements in academic libraries in
    the german federal republic and hamburg. describes results of a
    survey published in may 81 on the staffing situation and career
    opportunities in west german academic libraries, including'
    general information about the 670 participating libraries;
    posts available in the various service grades; division of
    posts between the main work spheres; vacant posts; temporary
    posts; new posts created in 1979 and 1980; planned changes in
    staffing. the survey was intended to show the varying
    situations in different job grades and in different regions and
    to give a clear picture of promotion prospects. hopes of
    improving salaries in certain states, especially hesse and
    hamburg, have been dashed because of the current economic
    situation but the survey has provided useful information which
    should stimulate further discussion.
