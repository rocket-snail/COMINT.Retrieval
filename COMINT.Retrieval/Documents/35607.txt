a method of approximate steady state analysis for non
    linear networks approximate solutions for the fundamental and
    third harmonic are obtained by a three stage method involving a
    first approximation to the fundamental frequency solution
    usually accurate to within a third harmonic solution generally
    within using an equivalent circuit which is dependent on the
    first fundamental solution a correction to the fundamental
    solution using third harmonic quantities which brings its
    accuracy to within about adaptations of some standard
    techniques of solving linear steady state problems for use with
    this method of analysis are described appendix by gh
