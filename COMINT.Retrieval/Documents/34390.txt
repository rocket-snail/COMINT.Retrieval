on the escape mechanism of secondary electrons from
    insulators starting from the boltzmann transport equation and
    with certain simplifying assumptions theory is developed which
    takes into account the interaction of secondary electrons with
    lattice vibrations traps and occupied donor levels at high trap
    densities the secondary yield for high primary energies is
    inversely proportional to the square root of the trap density
    at low trap densities yield is independent of trap density
    expressions for the temperature effect for high primary
    energies are derived for polar and nonpolar insulators results
    for the first case have been confirmed by experiment
