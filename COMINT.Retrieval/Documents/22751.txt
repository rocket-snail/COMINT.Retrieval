the effect of an intermediate layer on the frequency
    characteristics of ultrasonic delay lines general expressions
    are derived for the line conversion factor taking account of an
    intermediate layer between the transducer and the line the
    effect of this layer on the frequency characteristics and
    transmission band is considered and the relevant
    characteristics of different transducer and layer materials are
    tabulated
