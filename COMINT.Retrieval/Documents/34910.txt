generations of harmonics and subharmonics at microwave
    frequencies with pn junction diodes the performances of a
    nonlinear resistance and a nonlinear capacitance in a wideband
    harmonic generator circuit are analysed the nonlinear
    capacitance is shown to have a considerably higher efficiency
    results of experiments with a graded junction si nonlinear
    capacitance diode are given
