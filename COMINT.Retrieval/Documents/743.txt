the behaviour of metallic contacts at low voltages in
    adverse environments the problem discussed is that of obtaining
    a metal to metzl contact mechanically when the contacts are
    contaminated by dust or grease or are coated with films
    produced by absorption tarnishing or corrosion various types of
    contact are considered principles are outlined which provide a
    basis for design and testing a new technique is described for
    the continuous dry lubrication of sliding contacts in
    mechanical and electrical systems
