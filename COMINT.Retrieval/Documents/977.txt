the christian librarian and censorship: another view. a
    reply to 'liberty, democracy and censorship' the responsibility
    of the christian librarian', christian librarian (5) 1981,
    29-38 (see previous abstract). raises the following points' the
    secure believer can make a discriminating judgement in
    selecting materials, utilizing all the means at his disposal,
    even if it means including things he strongly disagrees with;
    librarians must be alert to the power of evil, but to conceal
    it is not to destroy it; the librarian spends public money,
    generated from people of many faiths, with different cultural
    and moral backgrounds; librarians need to be, and to be seen
    as, open persons who are consistently grappling with the issues
    of real life as they are reflected broadly in the publishing
    world; and finally, librarians should bea life-enhancing and a
    life-affirming influence and the library can be a genuine
    marketplace of ideas where 'good' books may compete with the
    bad simply because they are there together.
