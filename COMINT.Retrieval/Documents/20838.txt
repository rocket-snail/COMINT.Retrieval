ignition of electric discharge in gases by audio
    frequency current in tubes with external and internal
    electrodes an experimental investigation is reported of the
    dependence of ignition and discharge conditions on the
    frequency of the applied voltage up to tubes filled with or at
    a pressure with either plane or external annular electrodes
    were used results are presented graphically
