zimbabwean bibliography' recent contributions. part 6 in
    a series of articles surveying rhodesian/zimbabwean
    bibliography. examines 56 bibliographies on a variety of
    aspects of southern african life published since the 5th
    article in the series was published in oct 77 (2see1 79/3136).
    most of the bibliographies covered deal with history and
    biography, contemporary affairs and african nationalism but
    scientific, religious and art bibliographies are also
    discussed. it appears that initiative in local bibliographical
    creativity is passing to the academic and specialist which may
    be cause for concern to the librarian who believes that best
    results are obtained when bibliographical expertise is combined
    with subject specialist knowledge.
