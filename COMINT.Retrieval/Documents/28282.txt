electron lattice scattering technique for citation
    analysis and evaluating the impact of research papers.
    introduces a physical model for measuring the impact of
    research contribution based on scattering of electrons by the
    lattice atoms. describes scattering as a stochastic process and
    adopts an analogous situation in which lattice atoms and
    electrons have been replaced by a system of research papers and
    potential citers respectively. in the construction of the above
    model, the authors have made a number of simplifications and
    assumptions and developed an absorption index activity to be
    used as an index for measuring relative impact of various
    contributions in a given field of scientific research.
