role of scientific libraries in the national information
    system. in the 1980s, bulgarian libraries must meet the
    communist party requirements to become important contributors
    not only to the country's technological progress but also to
    the population's aesthetic education. to become equal partners
    in the national information system, scientific libraries have
    to reassess the potential for, and the means of implementing
    library cooperation and coordination in respect of building up
    their book collections. acquisition of publications and
    periodicals from the capitalist countries must, in particular,
    be planned very carefully considering the foreign currency
    resources. on the other hand, libraries must consider as the
    1st and foremost duty the dissemination of information
    regarding the achievements of the ussr and other socialist
    countries from which publications are freely available.
    interlibrary lending must be backed up and expedited by
    efficient telex and photocopying services. well-kept b
    ibliographic resources not only have information value but they
    also help in attracting new readers.
