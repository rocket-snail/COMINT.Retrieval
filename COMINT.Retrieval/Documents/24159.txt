the radiation belt produced by neutrons leaking out of
    the atmosphere of the earth the composition of the radiation
    belts is compared with that expected for a neutron decay source
    it seems that the inner belt is produced only by neutron e
    decay in the outer belt the electrons of energy greater than
    are probably produced by neutron decay but those of lower
    energy probably come froom outside the belt
