conditions for the occurrence of electrical discharges in
    astrophysical systems theoretical considerations of a large
    ionized mass of gass in motion show that neutral points of the
    magnetic field are unstable so that a small perturbation will
    start a discharge the orbits of particles in the field are
    considered particles with very large energies may be involved
    such discharges may account for aurorae and may also occur in
    solar flares and the interstellar gas
