the electromagnetic field in the plane of a circular
    aperture due to incident spherical waves measurements were made
    of the field in an aperture of diameter cm illuminated with
    radiation of wavelength from small radiators at various
    distances results are shown graphically the curves obtained can
    be represented approximately by a modified form of andrews
    equation of
