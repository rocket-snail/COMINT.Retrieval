the latin manuscript fragments in the bavarian state
    library. a collection of manuscript fragments has been housed
    in the bavarian state library since the beginning of the 19th
    century. in the 1860s an index was made by friedrich kein,
    using a scientific arrangement clearly separating the classical
    from the mediaeval. in 1977 a new classification of the latin
    fragments was created to allow more detailed analysis of each
    document and an index compiled which at present contains 2,810
    items. the range of signature numbers was extended, a
    concordance being provided to facilitate the recovery of texts
    cited under the old system. indexes of authors, anonyma, places
    of origin, signatures, miniatures and initials are included.
    the index may be made into a printed catalogue.
