a study of spread f ionospheric echoes at night at
    brisbane frequency spreading diurnal and seasonal variations in
    spreading of the penetration frequency are compared with
    similar world wide data the observations are interpreted in
    terms of scattering from clouds of enhanced ionization near the
    f layer maximum and a seasonal vertical movement of these
    clouds is suggested the extent of which increases with latitude
