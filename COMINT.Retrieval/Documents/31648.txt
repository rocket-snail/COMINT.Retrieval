frequency stability and accuracy of a crystal oscillator
    properties of crystals relevant to their use for frequency
    stabilization are reviewed the occurrence and elimination of
    crystal oscillations at undesired frequencies are discussed
    among the factors causing deviation of frequency from the
    nominal value the most important is the circuit arrangement the
    requirements for satisfactory crystal oscillator circuits are
    examined in detail a table indicates the frequency range
    maximum instability maximum inaccuracy maximum total frequency
    deviation and energy output of some known circuits
