preliminary discharge processes in lightning flashes to
    ground the first return stroke is usually preceded by three
    successive and distinct discharge processes lasting several
    hundred milliseconds the characteristics of the field changes
    in these preliminary stages are analysed in terms of the
    distance of the source probable mechanisms are discussed
