planning for new information systems. low cost computing
    hardware with increasingly sophisticated software is providing
    opportunities for the development of new, or the revision of
    existing, information systems. the procedures which are
    involved in the planning stage of such systems have been
    influenced by the costs involved and the decision making is
    more in the hands of the department or unit within an
    organisation than it was. a staged procedure with a checklist
    of activities, appropriate documentation and considerations to
    be taken at each stage is 1 way to reduce the chances of error
    in the decisions made in the planning process.
