universal formulae for the calculation of simple filters
    transfer properties and input impedance are given as functions
    of normalized frequency for filters with up to four tuned
    circuits for arbitrary ratio between source impedance and
    terminating impedance the calculations take account of circuit
    losses the formulae are evaluated and represented in curves
    details of the calculation are shown for a four circuit and
    pass filter a table is given of the most important filter
    circuits with the associated formulae and definitions
