the measure of activity of oscillators and the
    performance index the measure of activity of an oscillator is
    defined as the ratio of grid voltage amplitude to anode current
    amplitude in crystal controlled oscillators it is proportional
    to the crystal performance index the measure of activity is
    evaluated for several common types of oscillator
