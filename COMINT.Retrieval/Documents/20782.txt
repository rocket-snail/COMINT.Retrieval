the polish territorial bibliography system'
    organisational matters. discusses the organisation of a system
    of territorial bibliographies under formation in poland, based
    on the resolutions of the 3rd all-country meeting of
    bibliographers, 1978. the new system is based on a planned,
    controlled system of bibliographies covering the whole
    territory of the country, and synchronised with the country's
    present administrative division. it is designed to supplement
    the existing national bibliography, by recording information
    sources not at present covered by it. territorial
    bibliographies are considered as information tools within the
    territorial information system sinto (national system of
    scientific and technical information). compares the system with
    foreign bibliographic systems. the system is organised jointly
    by the ministry of culture and arts and the polish library
    system.
