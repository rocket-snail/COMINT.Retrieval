students criticise the situation concerning training at
    stuttgart library school. report of discussion at a weekend
    seminar, stuttgart, jan 81. many students have financial
    problems and difficulties in finding accommodation but,
    compared with other courses, few drop out and student-staff
    relationships are good. librarianship studies should develop
    critical faculties and the ability to make contact with
    readers. the library must become a communication centre, up to
    date and open to outside influences. regional needs should be
    emphasised rather than national standardisation. librarianship
    courses should contain new fields of study, like social and
    communication sciences. some formal lectures should be replaced
    by small study groups, examination procedures should be
    improved and better use made of practical training
    periods.
