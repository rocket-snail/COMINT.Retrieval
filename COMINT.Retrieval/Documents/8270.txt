comparison of the sensitivities of the beam maser and
    cavity absorption spectrometers a formula is derived for the
    signal noise ratio of the beam maser considering it as a
    special case of cavity spectrometer the sensitivity of the
    maser rr relative to the spectrometer varies inversely with the
    frequency
