a travelling wave parametric amplifier a lossless
    transmission line with periodically varying distributed
    inductance and a constant distributed capacitance will support
    a growing current wave for maximum amplification the oscillator
    used for providing the periodic variation of inductance must be
    synchronized with the incoming signal the noise figure of such
    an amplifier should be very favourable an experimental
    investigation is in progress and related schemes are being
    studied in which precise frequency and phase relations are not
    demanded
