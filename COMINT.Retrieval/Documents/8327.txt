on the radial extent of glow in microwave gas discharge
    between coaxial cylinders the glow appears in the region of
    maximum electric field strength close to the central wire over
    a radius mm the luminosity depends on the net production rate
    of electrons pr unit volume this rate is calculated and is
    shown graphically as a function of radius
