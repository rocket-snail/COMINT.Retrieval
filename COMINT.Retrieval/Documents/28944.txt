study and evaluation of the microphony due to vibration
    of the plates of a variable capacitor capacitance variations
    due to vibrations are investigated by observing the results
    distortion the latter being evaluated from the ratio between
    the third harmonic and the fundamental when a signal of
    amplitude about is applied this ratio is expressed as a
    function of the q of the measuring circuit details of which
    have been given previously of and the effect of variations of
    supply voltage is shown in curves
