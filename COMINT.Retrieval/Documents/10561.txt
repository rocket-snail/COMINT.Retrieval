radio astronomy the main part of this issue is devoted to
    a group of papers dealing with practical and theoretical
    aspects of radio astronomy abstracts of some of the papers are
    given individually titles of others are as follows introduction
    to radio astronomy the discovery and identification by karl
    guthe jansky of electromagnetic radiation of extraterrestrial
    origin in the radio spectrum early radio astronomy at wheaton
    illinois the telescope program for the national radio astronomy
    observatory at green bank west virginia noise levels at the
