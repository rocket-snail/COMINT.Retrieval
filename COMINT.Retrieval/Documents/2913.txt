monochromaticity and noise in a regenerative electrical
    oscillator expressions are derived for the departure from
    monochromaticity of a regenerative oscillator represented by an
    equivalent rlc circuit haing a negative resistance in parallel
    with r the intensity and band width of the thermal noise
    generated in the oscillator by resistance r are also
    considered
