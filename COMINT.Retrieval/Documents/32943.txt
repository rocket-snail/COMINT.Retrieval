consideration of some factors concerning the use of audio
    transformers the effect on the frequency response of using
    source or load impedances different from the rated values is
    discussed methods of reducing distortion due to nonlinear core
    characteristics and o eliminating noise due to various causes
    are indicated methods of matching several impedances to a
    single one simultaneously are shown
