the detection of electrons with energies of approximately
    in the upper atmosphere fluorescent sreen indicators on the
    third soviet satellite recorded electron fluxes at altitudes up
    to over the southern region of the pacific ocean the depence of
    electron and energy fluxes on direction relative to the earths
    field is examined it is suggested that the energy flux is
    sufficient to cause heating in the f region
