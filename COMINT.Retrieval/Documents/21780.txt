quantum oscillations of the high frequency surface
    impedance a quantum mechanical formula is derived and cases
    involving constant magnetic fields both parallel and inclined
    to the surface are considered from an experimental study of
    surface impedance in a strong magnetic field the shape of the
    fermi surface and the velocity of the electrons in it can be
    determined
