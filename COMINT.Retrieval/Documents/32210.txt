the title page of a record. the new rak (rules for
    alphabetical cataloguing) section on the cataloguing of musical
    scores and sound recordings has been available in pre-print
    form since the beginning of the year. practical testing of and
    discussion on the section are essential to reveal any gaps or
    ambiguities so that these may be eliminated. the question of
    what constitutes a title page where a record is concerned must
    be considered. according to the new rules, the label on the 1st
    side of a record or record set should be treated as the title
    page; if there is insufficient information here the record
    cover should be used instead. examples illustrate problems and
    possible discrepancies between labels and covers.
