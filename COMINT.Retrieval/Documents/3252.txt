utilization of chemical abstracts service (cas) data
    bases. application for the idc-inorganica-documentation-system.
    a method is developed describing the economic utilisation of
    the chemical abstracts service data bases; ca condensates and
    chemical abstracts subject index alert in order to supplement
    the data base of the idc-inorganica-documentationsystem built
    up to meet the peculiarities of inorganic chemistry. the method
    consists of edp-programs and processes at which special
    authority files for coded compound and subject entries play an
    important role. one of the advantages of the method is that the
    intellectual effort necessary to create such a data base is
    reduced to a minimum.
