the library as a municipal information centre' a danish
    example. with the ever-increasing amount of government
    legislation at national and local level it is essential that
    all citizens have access to information about their rights and
    duties. at lyngby-taarbaek in denmark a department of community
    information was created in 1977 to provide such a service. the
    collection includes material on environmental planning, minutes
    of local council meetings, and the addresses and services of
    local organisations. exhibitions are held on topics of current
    interest and a large part of the collection is available for
    loan. at the start of the service a publicity campaign was held
    with advertising posters and notices in local newspapers, and
    the department now answers some 300-400 enquiries per
    month.
