the transmission of geomagnetic disturbances through the
    atmosphere and interplanetary space the theory of the
    propagation of slowly varying disturbances through partially
    ionized gas is developed and applied to the earths atmosphere
    and interplanetary space the medium is considered as two
    separate co existing gasses an electron ion plasma and neutral
    atoms which move to some extent independently quantitative
    results are given for a model atmosphere extending to several
    earth rad
