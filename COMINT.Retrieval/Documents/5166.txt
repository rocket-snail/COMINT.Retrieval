general guide to the copyright act of 1976. the guide is
    based on lectures and training classes to prepare the copyright
    office staff and interested members of the public for
    implementation of the copyright act of 1976, most provisions of
    which took effect 1 jan 78. in developing lectures and lesson
    plans, the author relied heavily on the language of the law
    itself, the legislative reports, and various statements of the
    register of copyrights to the congress, i.e., the 1961 report
    of the register, the 1965 supplemental report, and the 1975
    second supplemental report. these documents may also be
    obtained from ntis. this guide is not an official summary of
    the law. it does not attempt to deal with all of the issues
    raised by the revision legislation nor to provide answers to
    legal questions. it is however, an extensive training
    tool.
