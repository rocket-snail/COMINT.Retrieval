the calculation of static and dynamic amplitude and
    frequency distortion of frequency modulated oscillations with
    the transmission factor given in series form the cases of
    frequency amplitude and limiting distortion distortion due to
    non ideal limiting conditions are investigated to derive
    general expressions for the treatment of signal
    distortion
