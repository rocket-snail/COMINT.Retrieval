sound recordings as sources of musical history. paper
    presented at the iaml annual conference, 1-7 july 79, salzburg.
    historical perspective on analogic recording of acoustical
    phenomena from edison's phonograph to modern hi-fi equipment.
    only those sources which offer a recording of real sound have
    the same historical status as written or printed sources. as
    such, the education of music historians and music librarians
    should include the scholarly study and evaluation of
    recordings, so that students may learn how to date records.
    acoustical knowledge of the production, transmission and
    recording of sound is indispensable knowledge for the
    musicologist who does not wish to ignore music's most important
    recent sources-recordings.
