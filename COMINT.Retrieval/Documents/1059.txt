gone fiche-ing.. microfiche projection has been suggested
    as an alternative to slide or overhead projectors by a
    succession of hardware producers. it is a very attractive idea,
    but there are drawbacks, including ambient light, the need to
    use the fiche in order with no dodging about back and forth,
    and the inability of the presenter to draw or write on the
    fiche.
