calculation of compensated wide band amplifiers in german
    and french loss of amplification with increasing frequency due
    to the output capacitance of the amplifier valve is compensated
    by including inductance in the circuit three arrangements are
    discussed namely parallel compensation series compensation and
    double compensation abacs to facilitate calculations are
    presented
