wave matrices of a quadripole th use of scattering and
    transmission matrices for cm wave quadripoles is considered and
    the essential properties of these wave matrices are determined
    the method is illustrated by a practical example in which an
    examination is made of the modulus and phase of the reflection
    coefficient of a waveguide filter consisting of two equal
    inhomogeneities and separated by a section of waveguide
    propagating an wave
