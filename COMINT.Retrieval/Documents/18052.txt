design of low pass ladder networks to work between
    unequal resistances discussion of conversion data to enable
    formulae established in an earlier pp paper of to be used ror
    cases of unequal terminating resistances curves are presented
    relating the ratio of input and output branch resistances to
    the ratio of input and output decrement for up to five branches
