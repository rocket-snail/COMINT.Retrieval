alesund library on the town's most central site. alesund
    central library, norway, opened in sept 80 as part of a major
    administrative building. the project had undergone long and
    controversial discussion and the librarian was not involved at
    the planning stage, an unsatisfactory situation. the library
    (with more and romsdal county library) now occupies centrally
    placed premises of 2400 sq.m. though its long, narrow shape is
    awkward and rather cramped. a walkway with stairs, ramps and a
    lift from ground level helps to compensate for the library's
    situation on the 1st floor. the public are very pleased with
    the warm, attractive interior. an internal lift gives access to
    basement stacks; the main departments are all on the 1st floor,
    but the 2nd floor houses offices and a complex of public rooms
    for meetings, study groups and story hours.
