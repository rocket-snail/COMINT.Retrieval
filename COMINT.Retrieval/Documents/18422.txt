coaxial cavity filters for multiplexing of radio relay
    systems essentially full text of paper to be published in
    filters are discussed comprising cascaded coaxial line sections
    the selectivity attained permits a frequency separation as low
    as between a transmitter and a receiver operating on a common
    aerial and a separation as low as between transmitters or
    receivers
