lombardy' the establishment of a system for collective
    cataloguing and bibliographical information. discusses the
    reasons behind the suspension of the projected network in
    lombardy, begun in 1975 and disrupted in 1977. details are
    given of the structure of the system drawn up by the regional
    administration, the organisation and operation of existing
    libraries as information and cataloguing centres, and the
    technical equipment introduced. with the change of government
    in 1977, the project was suspended for re-evaluation, and up to
    1980 no decision had been reached. the inherent defects of the
    system are analysed, to show how the regional administration
    made a fundamental error in establishing a decentralised system
    without overhauling existing services to ensure adequate
    cooperation between cataloguing centres. the immediate causes
    of suspension were incompatability of the automated system
    chosen with marc, and failure of individual libraries to
    maintain routine cataloguing activities. emph asises the
    necessity for basic reorganisation of national library services
    prior to schemes for automation and cooperation.
