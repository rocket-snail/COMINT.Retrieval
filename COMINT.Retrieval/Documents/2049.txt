magnetostatics with ferromagnetic materials a variational
    principle is formulated and proved in the theory of
    ferromagnetic materials in the field of electric currents a
    direct method is developed for investigating magnetic fields in
    the general case of a nonlinear dependence of permeability on
    magnetic field strength
