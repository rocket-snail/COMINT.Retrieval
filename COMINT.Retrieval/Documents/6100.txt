surviving the present: san francisco public library. the
    102-year-old 26-branch san francisco public library is under
    great financial pressure due to inflation and the results of
    proposition 13 (a measure passed in 1978 which cut california
    state property taxes by about 55%, hitting all local government
    revenues). outlines the resultant cuts and economies and
    describes the work of the public library's friends who staff
    the main library information desk for 50 hours weekly,
    publicise the library's activities, and raise money. briefly
    describes some collections in the main library; the much-used
    business branch and chinatown branch; and the communications
    center (a cultural and information centre using all media and
    serving the blind, deaf, and physically handicapped).
