sap-a new way to produce subject descriptions. within the
    scope of the subject access project (sap), at lund university
    library, sweden, a new version of on-line catalogue for
    monographs has been developed. using the sap-indexing method,
    existing bibliographic catalogue records have been enriched
    with selected terms from contents tables and book indexes. the
    idea of sap is to produce subject descriptions of books taken
    from the books themselves and to make more use of a
    publication's 'inherent' attributes. it is also an approach to
    the shortcomings of classification systems in describing a
    book's contents by means of a limited number of classification
    codes. by sap, low cost retrieval capabilities are provided for
    monograph users.
