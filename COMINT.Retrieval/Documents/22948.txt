cathode follower as high impedance input stage if a
    cathode follower is used as the first stage of an amplifier in
    order to raise the input impedance the conductance of the grid
    leak between grid and cathode may not be negligible compared
    with the conductance of the source between grid and earth from
    which the signal is derived the noise performance under these
    conditions is examined both in terms of the cathode follower
    regarded as a voltage device and in terms of the noise figure
    which takes account of the difference between input and output
    impedances
