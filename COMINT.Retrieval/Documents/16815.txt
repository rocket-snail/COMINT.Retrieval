our tasks. the official 1977-unesco statistics show that,
    as far as numbers of libraries and librarians, and also annual
    acquisitions per head of population, are concerned, bulgaria
    lies in the 7th and 4th places respectively in the world.
    however, bulgaria takes the 14th and 19th places in loans and
    in turnover of current book collections. thus, higher
    efficiency required in all fields of the nation's life by the
    recent 12th congress of the bulgarian communist party must also
    be aimed for in libraries and information centres. great
    attention must be paid in particular to scientific and other
    special libraries which need to cope not only with the present
    information explosion, but also with soaring prices of western
    publications and bulgaria's limited foreign currency resources.
    amongst other problems are the education and training of
    librarians, the needs in new library buildings, mechanisation,
    automation, and updating of library management. the cyril and
    methodius national library, not only as keeper of the national
    literary heritage, but also as the most important library and
    information centre in the whole country, is, in itself, a
    special case. it should be relieved of some of its problems on
    the occasion of the 1300th anniversary of the bulgarian
    state.
