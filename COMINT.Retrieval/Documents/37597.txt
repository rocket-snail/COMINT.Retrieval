on the frequency of occurrence and amplitude spectrum of
    the geomagnetic field pulsations the results of investigations
    of geomagnetic micropulsations observed at the soviet flux
    measurement stations during are presented diurnal variations of
    amplitude and of frequency of occurrence of micropulsations
    having different periods are investigated
