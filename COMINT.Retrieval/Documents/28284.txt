negatively biased multivibrator description of a
    multivibrator which has its grids returned to a negative bias
    it has high frequency stability and is suitable for use as a
    variable frequency source or a source of special wave shapes
    and can be frequency modulated the frequency varies linearly
    with bias voltage
