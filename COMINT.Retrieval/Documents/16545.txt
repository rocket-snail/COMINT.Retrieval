notes on correlation methods for evaluating ionospheric
    winds from radio fading records a method requiring only six
    values of the correlation coefficient obtained from fading
    records at three receiver stations is developed the theory is
    extended to include elliptical constant correlation contours in
    the horizontal plane data obtained during february indicate
    that the correlation ellipse shows a preferred orientation and
    that fading associated with random changes in the ionosphere is
    as important as that associated with drift
