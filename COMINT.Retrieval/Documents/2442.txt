effects of making longer open-hours on the number of
    library users. the saitama medical school library extended its
    hours until 8pm in nov 79. the effect of the extension was
    measured by comparing the number of persons entering the
    library between the periods of nov 78 through apr 79, and nov
    79 through apr 80. results show that the number of persons
    entering the library increased for every day of the week except
    fridays; the overall peak library hours increased by 1 hour and
    extend between 12 noon to 5pm, instead of the previous 12 noon
    to 4pm. the status analysis of the library patrons showed an
    increase in every category, and the peak library hours for
    students extended between 12 noon and 5pm, instead of the
    previous 12 noon to 3pm. the peak hours for faculty and staff
