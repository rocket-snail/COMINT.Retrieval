prolegomena to an australian code of professional ethics
    for librarians. the substance of this paper was delivered as an
    address at the spring festival dinner of the act branch of the
    laa, 25 sept 81. examines critically the codes of ethics for
    librarians which have been published in the usa and the uk, and
    discusses a number of points for consideration when drawing up
    such a code for australian libraries. considers the issues that
    give rise to questions of professional ethics-in particular
    literature controls (censorship) and the client's right to
    privacy (freedom to read). argues that such a code should be
    precise and clear and take cognizance of the fact that
    librarians dispose of a lot of power.
