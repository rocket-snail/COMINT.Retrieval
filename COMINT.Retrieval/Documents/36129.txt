the effect of fluctuations on the diffraction patterns of
    a focusing system general formulae are derived for the average
    distribution of intensity and the distribution of fluctuations
    in a diffraction pattern when fluctuations are present in the
    incident wave limiting cases of large and small fluctuations
    are considered
