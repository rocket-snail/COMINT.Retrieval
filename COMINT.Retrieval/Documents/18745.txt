hydromagnetic wave propagation in the ionosphere general
    equations are obtained governing hydromagnetic wave propagation
    assuming approximations valid for the ionosphere for wave
    periods of less than one h the equations are very similar to
    those for the propagation of radio waves in the
    ionosphere
