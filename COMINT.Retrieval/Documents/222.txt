geomagnetic and ionospheric phenomena associated with
    nuclear explosions magnetograms and ionograms recorded at
    stations in the central pacific ocean have been analysed for
    the periods covering the explosions on and august some
    geomagnetic variation could be explained by a dynamo effect
    associated with wind velocities of miles sec and a ten fold
    increase in electrical conductivity
