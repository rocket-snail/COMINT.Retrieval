reviewing slides for library use. in the netherlands a
    librarian responsible for the acquisition of slide series for
    his library may rely for his selection on reviews in the
    professional literature or on the recommended collections of
    the netherlands bibliotheek en lectuur centrum (dutch centre
    for libraries and literature). the librarian should also
    examine the technical quality of the slide, including the
    sharpness of the image and the accuracy of the colours. in
    addition he should examine the way in which information is
    presented in the slides and the accompanying text. a series of
    apparently unconnected images leaves the viewer bored. at
    present too many slide series are of poor quality and
    librarians must be prepared to complain to manufacturers in
    order to rectify this situation.
