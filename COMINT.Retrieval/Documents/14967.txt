benefit assessment methodology: the key priority for
    library research. based on the author's book, do we really need
    libraries (see 81/3169). discusses 2 recent studies in which
    the question of money values was deliberately avoided and an
    attempt was made to judge a library's performance by assessing
    (1) how well it was getting through to the customers at whom
    the service was aimed and (2) what impact the service had on
    those exposed to it. the 2 establishments thus evaluated were
    the access library of the greater london council (uk) and the
    management information centre at the british institute of
    management.
