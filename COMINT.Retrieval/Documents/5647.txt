the inhouse solution for document processing and
    retrieval by axp. with idor-inhouse document online
    retrievalsystem-a self-supporting and complete technology of
    document processing, is introduced. this new technology offers
    the usual convenience of minicomputers with the speed of
    processing of mainframes. this is accomplished by the
    implementation of a special firmware-product, the axp-associate
    crosspoint processor. axp compares the contents of the data
    bank at transfer-rates up to 1.2 megabytes per second with
    8,192 bytes of parallel query term memory. the normal effort of
    the input-processing in this system brings with it the
    additional advantages of further processing such as retrieval,
    correction, updating etc.
