printed matter in the face of new media. the evolution of
    means of communication based on the use of television apparatus
    is discussed, with particular emphasis on satellite tv, fibre
    optics, digitisation of signals, videotex and cable tv. the
    implications of these new technologies for the printing
    industry are assessed. in particular, an attempt is made to
    identify those markets which are directly threatened by
    electronic media and those which will be enhanced and
    expanded.
