general properties of frequency converting networks a
    generalized analysis of frequency converting systems consisting
    of networks containing nonlinear inductors capacitors and
    resistors and including also nonlinear l c and r coupling
    elements the mesh and nodal equations for a general nonlinear
    network are given and it is assumed that a certain high voltage
    and current distribution the so called fundamental state
    results from the presence of carrier current and voltage
    sources first order perturbational equations are then derived
    corresponding to the disturbance of the disturbance of the
    fundamental state by small signal voltage or current sources
    linear differential equations with time dependent coefficients
    are obtained which yield for a periodic fundamental state
    equations in matrix form methods of simplifying the matrices
    are shown and the method is used to examine stability
    conversion gain and loss an example a polyphase magnetic
    modulator is analysed
