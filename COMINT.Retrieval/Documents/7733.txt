the anomalous skin effect and the reflectivity of metals
    if the gas of conduction electrons is subject to internal
    friction the resultant energy dissipation contributes to the
    absorption factor of metallic conductors this contribution can
    become predominant at low temperatures if this effect is
    combined with those studied by dingle of september for the case
    of mean free path comparable with skin depth agreement between
    theory and experiment is improved
