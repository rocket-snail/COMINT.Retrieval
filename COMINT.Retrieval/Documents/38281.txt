the correlation of bursts of solar radio emission in the
    centimetre range with flares and sudden ionospheric
    disturbances statistical investigations of observations during
    the first six months reveal a close correlation between bursts
    in the range it is concluded that both the radiation and the
    ionizing radiation responsible are generated by super thermal
    electrons
