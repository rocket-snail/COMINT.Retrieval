juding the quality of oscillator circuits discussion of
    the frequency and amplitude stability of oscillators considered
    as composed of a slightly nonlinear frequency independent
    amplifier and a linear frequency dependent feedbz feedback
    quadripole stability is found to depend on the rate of change
    of the imaginary part of the voltage transfe transfer
    characteristic of the feedback quadripole the use of this
    criterion in the design of bridge stabilized rc oscillators is
    illustrated measurements on and various faults of experimental
    oscillators are briefly discussed
