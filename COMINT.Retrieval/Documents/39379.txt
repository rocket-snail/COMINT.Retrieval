discriminator circuit analysis theory and performance
    figures are given for a simple frequency discriminator circuit
    using an asymmetrical arrangement the conversion efficiency
    compares favourably with that of the equivalent foster seeley
    discriminator it is particularly recommended for purposes where
    high efficiency is of greater importance than accurate
    linearity over a wide frequency range
