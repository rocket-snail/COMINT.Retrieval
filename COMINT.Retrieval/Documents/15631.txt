searching biases in large interactive document retrieval
    systems. the way that individuals construct and modify search
    queries on a large interactive document retrieval system is
    subject to systematic biases similar to those that have been
    demonstrated in experiments on judgments under uncertainty.
    these biases are shared by both naive and sophisticated
    subjects and cause the inquirer to construct and modify queries
    inefficiently. a searching algorithm is suggested that helps
    the inquirer to avoid the effect of these biases.
