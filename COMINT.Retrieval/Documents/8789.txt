the use of photocomposition and filmsetting for the
    computerised production of information media. there are many
    ways of processing textual and other forms of information, for
    photocomposition and filmsetting through the use of eser
    computers; various methods for using these techniques, based on
    the comprehensive performance range of the equipment, are
    described. firstly, a simple example of typesetting is
    described to illustrate the technical processes and the
    typographically new qualitative characteristics of modern
    photocopying and filmsetting equipment. the eser setting
    programme, developed jointly by the data processing centre in
    berlin and other interested bodies involved in printing and
    graphics, represents an excellent text processing programme
    system which is also available to outside users. the modular
    concept allows the rational use of photocomposition and
    filmsetting for production of a wide range of information media
    which can be adapted at low expense.
