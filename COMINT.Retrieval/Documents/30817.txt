managing exxon's technical reports. the technical
    information contained in exxon reports is managed by use of an
    in-house, computerised system that builds a data base and
    produces current-awareness 'report alerts', various indexes
    including a subject kwic, an on-line data base, and
    reports-distribution control. key elements in the system are:
    (1) a structural report number that incorporates codes for the
    issuing unit, major subject, and date; (2) natural-language
    indexing sentences that make up a pseudo abstract; and (3)
    controlled subject categories that are a base for the 'reports
    alerts' system.
