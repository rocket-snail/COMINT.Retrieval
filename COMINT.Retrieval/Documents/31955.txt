measurement of the current during the formative time lag
    of sparks in uniform fields in air measurements were made of
    the current in a parallel plane gap during the period between
    application of a voltage and occurrence of breakdown the
    current increased from a few microseconds after application of
    the voltage to just before breakdown for time lags between and
    the results are in agreement with previously developed theory
    except for an observed delay in the initial current rise a
    possible explanation of this is discussed
