the contributions of walter hofmann and rudolf angermann
    towards the development of user research methods, part i.
    hofmann and angermann carried out their research at the
    beginning of this century, during the period of the movement
    for popular education. they felt that library staff should know
    about each reader's requirements from and motivation towards
    reading so that the library could perform effectively its
    educative function. hofmann advocated the importance of
    personal contact between staff and readers and of typological
    grouping of readers with the aid of loan frequency statistics.
    his new classification system for subject indexes was used in
    compiling catalogues of the leipzig bucherhalle. hofmann also
    favoured the use of selective indexes aimed at target groups in
    addition to that of general catalogues.
