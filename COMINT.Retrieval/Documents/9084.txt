edinburgh city libraries' online order experiment.
    discusses a project devised by the british library research and
    development department involving edinburgh city libraries to
    test an on-line information retrieval experiment linked to book
    ordering. c. askew & sons ltd, library suppliers have a
    data base containing their stock file, customer order file, and
    outstanding order file, and edinburgh libraries access the
    system by vdu. files may be searched using stock titles; order,
    invoicing and reporting instructions; outstanding order status;
    and stock titles by dewey number range. the experiment improved
    the period from issue to receipt of an order by almost a
    week.
