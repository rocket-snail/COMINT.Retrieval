the penetration depth in impure superconducting tin a new
    method is described for measuring the surface impedance of
    metals at low temperatures and at radio frequencies using this
    method the surface impedance of normal tin and the penetration
    depth in superconducting tin have been studied at about
    frequency as a function of impurity content the measured
    surface impedances agree well with the values expected and the
    penetration depths increase with impurity content in
    confirmation of pippards observations
