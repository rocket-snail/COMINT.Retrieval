dissected amplifiers using negative resistance possible
    circuit arrangements of semiconductor devices to give hf
    amplification are discussed based on segregation of the
    amplifier properties of negative resistance and directionality
    an arrangement of a hexagonal ge plate with magnetic field
    perpendicular to its plane and with an appropriate network of
    resistances corresponds to a pentode amplifier
