contribution to the theory of general quadripoles the
    matrix characteristics of general linear quadripoles are
    investigated and a strict definition of a lossless quadripole
    is given an equivalent circuit of the quadripole formed by
    three partial quadripoles connected in tandem is derived
    matching problems and a formula for power gain are
    discussed
