mass storage technology and file organization. paper
    presented at the international workshop on chinese library
    automation, taipei, taiwan, 14-19 feb 81. considers the rapid
    evolution of mass storage technology and its influence on file
    organisation. technological advances have made what seemed
    impractical in 1971 become eminently practical in 1981 and
    librarians must thus examine the technological environment to
    determine which of their perceived limitations are real and
    which are illusory and soon to be smashed. this examination is
    perhaps most essential for mass storage file organisation as
    this has the most marked and long-lasting effect on the
    performance of automated bibliographic systems.
