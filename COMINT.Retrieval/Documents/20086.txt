library instruction and graduate students' more work for
    george. results of a survey of faculty members of the
    university of missouri at kansas city's school of
    administration, into their attitudes towards library
    instruction for graduate students, are presented. concludes
    that library skills are increasingly inadequate the longer the
    students remain in school, that students may provide a more
    accurate estimation of their own library research skills than
    do their instructors and finally, that librarians can utilise
    students' self-evaluations of resource skills to convince
    faculty of the need for more library instruction at the
    graduate level.
