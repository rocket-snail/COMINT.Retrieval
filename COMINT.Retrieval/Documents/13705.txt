microwave attenuation by cyclotron resonance in a
    slightly ionized gas the boltzmann equation is solved for the
    distribution function of electrons in a static magnetic field b
    and a hf electric field the tensor dielectric constant and
    propagation constant k are hence obtained the attenuation
    spectrum is discussed for the two cases of parallel and
    perpendicular to b
