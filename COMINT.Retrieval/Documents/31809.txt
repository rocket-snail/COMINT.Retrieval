some aspects of library networking in the usa. 3 types of
    american library networks are defined' organisational,
    specialised and functional. public libraries belong to the
    first group, whose planning and development are the
    responsibility of state libraries. specialised networks link
    together special libraries devoted to the same subject
    discipline (nationwide networks of medical or agricultural
    libraries belong to this group). the last type brings together
    libraries whose automated systems are based on the use of the
    same data base (e.g. oclc). organisational structure of the
    networks is discussed together with several other aspects
    including users, centralised cataloguing and book processing,
    long term planning, coordinated acquisitions, interlibrary
    lending and compilation of union catalogues and
    bibliographies.
