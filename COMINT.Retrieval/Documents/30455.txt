graph potentials method and its application for chemical
    information processing. a graph potentials method for the
    solution of isomorphism and automorpism partitioning problems
    is proposed. the method is based on an analogy between graphs
    and electrical networks and serves to compute graph invariants,
    including vertex potentials and other characteristics and to
    provide an efficient solution to the problems. some
    computational results demonstrating sensitivity of the proposed
    method are presented.
