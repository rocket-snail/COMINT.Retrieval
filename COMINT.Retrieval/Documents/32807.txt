qualifications required of staff members at university of
    technology libraries. contribution to an issue devoted to
    education for technological university library work. gives a
    short historical review of formal qualifications required of
    applicants to qualified librarians' posts in swedish academic
    libraries. shows how new developments in education and research
    as well as in library techniques have affected conditions of
    work in a library. new tasks have been added to the traditional
    ones, and it is necessary to find ways of reconciling the new
    development with existing library expertise, and to find a
    common dominator which will work towards an integration of all
    tasks in a library. this is found in the overall aims for
    library work' to meet the needs of the customer. instruction
    and training on how best to meet the users' needs should
    therefore form an important part of all education for
    librarianship.
