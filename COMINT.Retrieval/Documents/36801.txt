the relativistic electromagnetic equations in a material
    medium the general relativistic em equations for a material
    medium are expressed in the form of a single four vector
    density equation the field tensor has six different complex
    components instead of three as in the case of a free medium the
    classical equations are obtained by separating the real and
    imaginary parts
