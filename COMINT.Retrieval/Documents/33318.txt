corner plots an approximation to the shape of the actual
    response curve for rl and rc circuits is obtained by suitable
    combinations of straight lines called corner plots the
    parameters involved are defined and rules for their
    determination by inspection of the circuit derived the method
    is not restricted to impedances but may also be applied to
    network transfer functions and is discussed in bodes network
    analysis and feedback amplifier design chapter
