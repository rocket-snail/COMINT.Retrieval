on the distribution of refractive index in the lower
    atmosphere in japan radiosonde data for heights up to are
    analysed contour maps show the derived distribution of
    effective earth radius factor for day and night in each month
    of the year the distribution is closely related to the movement
    of the air mass predicted values of field strength for over a
    path are generally greater for summer than for winter in
    agreement with observed values
