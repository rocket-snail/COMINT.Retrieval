the conservation of the french documentary heritage.
    among the many expressions of the past brought to light during
    heritage year in france (1980), the book, in manuscript and
    print forms, in public or private collections, ought to be
    protected by a national conservation policy. although a number
    of partial inventories exist, such a policy cannot be
    maintained at present in france without the existence of a
    general inventory. apart from the national library, which has
    specialised restoration facilities and a department for the
    prevention and detection of damaged documents, libraries rarely
    have the means to assure the material protection of documents.
    the protection of the national heritage should extend to the
    selection of 20th century documents.
