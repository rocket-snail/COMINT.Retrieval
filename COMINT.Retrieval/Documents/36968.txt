divided output transformers to overcome self capacity in
    the primary winding of an af output transformer at high
    frequencies the output from the final stage may be fed to two
    transformers one for the low frequency and the other for the
    high frequency range this overcomes the necessity for a single
    high quality transformer and the output can be fed directly to
    two separate loudspeakers
