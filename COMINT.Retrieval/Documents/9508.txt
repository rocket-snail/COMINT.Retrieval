ferromagnetic spinels with rectangular hysteresis loops
    tests made on materials of different composition show to be
    most suitable for magnetic storage elements for rings of
    outside diameter inside diameter mil the coercive force is
    about oersteds and switch over time rings of outside diameter
    have a lower coercive force
