information networks, fact or fantasy?. report of a paper
    of the same title presented by anne morrow at a meeting of the
    library association of australia's community information
    special interest group, melbourne, victoria, aug 79. malvern
    information network is a network of local agencies linked by a
    pabx telephone. it is very informal, has no constitution, and
    simply aims at providing a better community information service
    than the agencies could if working independently. each agency
    specialises in a particular field. agency representatives meet
    monthly. residents gain access to the network by contacting
    their nearest agency. successes to date include establishment
    of a neighbourhood bus, an accommodation information exchange,
    and a self-help employment service. failures include outreach
    to migrants and isolated groups.
