solution of electromagnetic scattering problems as power
    series in the ratio dimension of scatterer wavelength the
    calculation of the successive terms in the series expressing
    the scattered field requires only the solution of standard
    problems in potential theory together with the evaluation of
    certain potential integrals the series can be calculated as far
    as desired if laplaces equation can be solved but the
    calculation is increasingly complex for successive terms the
    spries can be calculated as far as desired if laplaces equation
    can be solved but the calculation is increasingly complex for
    successive terms the special case of scattering by a perfect
    conductor is also considered and its relation to the problem of
    diffraction by an aperture in a conducting screen is indicated
    expressions for the distant field are derived
