on the magnetization of toroids with one and two air gaps
    a method is proposed for calculating the leakage coefficient in
    the case of a toroid with one large air gap and an experimental
    formula is derived for determining the average leakage
    coefficient for the cases of toroids with one air gap and with
    two diametrically opposite air gaps
