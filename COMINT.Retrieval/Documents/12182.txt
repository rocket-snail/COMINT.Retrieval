method for generating a chemical reaction index for
    storage and retrieval of information. a new method for indexing
    chemical reactions is described. the calculation of a reaction
    connectivity index results in a unique number. this number does
    not provide hierarchical or relational information. it encodes
    the concept of the reaction process in a unique identifier
    which is suggested for use, much as the cas registry number is
    used, to optimise ease of storage, manipulation, and retrieval
    from large computer files.
