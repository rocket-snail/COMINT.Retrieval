ionospheric scattering of satellite trn transmissions
    reports of observations of night time scintillations of
    satellite transmissions are briefly analysed in relation to the
    position of the observing station and the direction of passage
    of the satellite results demonstrate the ability of field
    aligned irregularities to scatter radio waves in a manner
    highly sensitive to aspect see also of april
