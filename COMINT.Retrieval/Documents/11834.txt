online data searching as a tool for motivating
    innovation. a study was conducted to test the contention; which
    is supported by a review of the literature that access to a
    wide variety of ideas and novelty will tend to stimulate
    innovation. the experiment consisted of a study of attitude
    changes through pre- and post-test administration of a research
    questionnaire to a group of 20 voluntary participants from a
    small high technology company before and after a 60-day period
    of exposure to on-line searching. evaluation using standard
    statistical tests indicated that a statistically significant
    increase in perceived level of innovation occurred after the
    subject's exposure to on-line data searching. in addition, a
    direct and positive relationship between the perceived level of
    new idea generation and the frequency of on-line searching was
    observed. report not available from ntis.
