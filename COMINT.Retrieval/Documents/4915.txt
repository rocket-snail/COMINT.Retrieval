corporate planning and the electronic office. reviews
    fundamental activities of departments comprising a typical
    manufacturing company and develops the theme for electronic and
    computer based aids for re-shaping the general administration
    functions of such a company. an analysis of the contribution
    made to a company operation by such specialists as sales
    engineers, designers, planning, tooling engineers and
    accountants shows that offices are traditionally designed to
    handle the generation, transportation and storage of paper. the
    advent of the computer, v.d.u. and television link have
    challenged the role of paper as a communication medium. a
    typical organisational structure, arising from development of
    such a scheme is suggested together with a block schematic of a
    typical remotely manned interactive data terminal that will
    enable staff to work from home if required. the ramifications
    of employment methods, project management problems, motivation
    and possible methods of remuneration are di scussed.
