local government library planning and its development
    from the viewpoint of general administration. as long as there
    are no library laws guaranteeing financial provision, public
    libraries will be counted among the 'voluntary'
    responsibilities of local government, which are particularly
    affected in times of recession. library planning is described
    within the context of general municipal administration,
    including the importance of establishing priorities and of
    library cooperation with other local government departments,
    especially those concerned with organisation, personnel and
    finance. many important problems must be solved before new
    projects can be carried out and possible alternatives must be
    tested.
