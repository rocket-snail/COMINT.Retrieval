radiation produced by an electron beam passing through a
    dielectric medium an electron beam passing through a dielectric
    medium may produce an instability that is associated with the
    growth of longitudinal waves having a velocity close to the
    velocity of the beam if homogeneities are present these
    longitudinal waves may be converted into transverse waves and
    radiated into space thus there is a possibility of a luminous
    effect at bohr frequencies that differ from the vavilov
    cherenkov frequencies
