the interpretation of night time low frequency ionograms
    two types of retardation of the extraordinary ray on passing
    through a region whose frequency is below the gyro frequency
    are discussed one is observed near the critical frequency of
    the ordinary ray and the other near the gyro frequency
    information about the total number and distribution of
    electrons below the f layer can be deduced from them
