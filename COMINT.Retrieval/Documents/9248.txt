    united states postal service will begin the 1st part of a
    3-phase plan to offer americans electronic delivery of mail.

    discussed. documents can be sent via electronic mail as
    facsimile messages or displayed on the library c.r.t.
    interlibrary loans in the future could be accomplished within
