interprocess communication in distributed systems' one
    view. describes the programme of experimental research in
    distributed (decentralised) systems carried out in the computer
    communications networks group, university of waterloo, ontario,
    for the last 6 years. focuses on inter-process communication
    (ipc) techniques and compares message-switched ipc facilities
    in several distributed systems developed at waterloo and
    elsewhere. points of comparison include message management,
    synchronisation modes, and performance. examines reasons for
    the waterloo team's almost invariable choice of
    message-switched ipc for its distributed systems.
