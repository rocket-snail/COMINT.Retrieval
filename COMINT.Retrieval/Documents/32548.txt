electromagnetic radiation from electron plasma theory
    developed by bohm and pines and back references is extended to
    treat the coupling between longitudinal and transverse plasma
    oscillations arising from the quantum fluctuation of electrons
    interacting with the field the theory may provide the
    explanation of the outbursts of solar emission molecular
    ringing semiclassical radiation theory is used to describe the
    response of an assemblage of two state molecules driven by an
    electromagnetic field when the field is suddenly removed the
    assemblage does not immediately become quiescent it continues
    to radiate in diminishing amount this coherent molecular
    ringing return to the values they had at the beginning of the
    driving pulse the ringing radiation may exhibit a delayed
    peak
