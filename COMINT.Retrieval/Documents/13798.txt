libraries and librarianship in canada. presents a picture
    of library development in canada. the sub-sections are
    geographic and topical but all emphasise the current situation.
    the sparse population, the vastness of the country, the
    political organisation, the multicultural and multilingual
    nature of the inhabitants have all influenced libraries and
    librarianship in canada. up to recently the library situation
    was buoyant but it appears that the present and the near future
    economic conditions will slow the process and will force a
    reassessment of the role of libraries in canadian
    society.
