highly stable power supply description of equipment
    giving voltages adjustable between and with loads up to the
    variation of output voltage is of the order of part in for line
    fluctuations of the dc output resistance is and the residual
    hum voltage a valve is used as voltage comparison standard the
    feedback circuit includes two pentode stages and a cathode
    follower stage comprising two triodes in parallel
