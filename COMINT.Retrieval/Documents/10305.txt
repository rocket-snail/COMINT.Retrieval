an experimental impedance relay using the hall effect in
    a semiconductor description of a definite impedance relay for
    the protection of power transmission systems the hall output
    voltage from an insb crystal is balanced by a voltage from a
    rectifier unit when a fault occurs in the system an out of
    balance voltage is produced which operates an electromagnetic
    relay
