the optimum line width for the transition used in a
    reflection cavity maser amplifier the line of the amplifying
    transition in a reflection cavity maser is shown to have an
    optimum value which will give maximum amplification bandwidth
    at a fixed gain difficulties associated with achieving the
    optimum line width in practice for the paramagnetic maser are
    briefly discussed
