direction finding studies of large scale ionospheric
    irregularities continuation of work noted in of a report is
    given of measurements on pulse modulated transmissions in the
    frequency range reflected from the ionosphere both vertical
    incidence and oblique incidence observations were made the
    directional variations of the reflected signals were studied
    and are interpreted as due to tilting or wrinkling of the
    constant ionic density surfaces in the ionosphere the results
    indicate large scale horizontal movements in the ionosphere in
    the e layer these appear to be of the nature of drifting clouds
    of ionization while in the f layer the effects are consistent
    with horizontally travelling ripples having wavelengths of and
    speeds up to the direction of motion is more often towards east
    or west than towards north or south and evidence of a diurnal
    variation has been observed
