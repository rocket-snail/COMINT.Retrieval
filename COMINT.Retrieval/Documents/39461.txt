analyzing the availability of reference services. the key
    to the objective branching analysis of reference services is
    the identification of a chain of essentially independent
    conditions which must be met for a patron to obtain the service
    required. explores the problems involved in such
    identification, illustrating each problem with data collected
    from 16 libraries in the lorcost project (levels of output
    related to costs of operation of scientific and technical
    libraries, a 2-year study to collect primary information from
    50 such libraries) which elected to collect data on reference
    service availability.
