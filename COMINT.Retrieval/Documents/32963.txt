an attempt to measure the collision frequency of
    electrons in the f region of the ionosphere measurem nts have
    been made of the change in the f layer reflection coefficient
    with change in group path results indicate that values of
    collision frequency obtained from this type of measurement are
    unreliable but an upper limit is deduced
