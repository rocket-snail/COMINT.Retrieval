a note on the theory of space charge limited currents the
    experimental results of branwood and tredgold of january with
    are explained by a simple model in which there are thin layers
    of uncharged traps at the surface of the dielectric which are
    uniformly distributed in space and of one energy depth the bulk
    of the material contains no traps
