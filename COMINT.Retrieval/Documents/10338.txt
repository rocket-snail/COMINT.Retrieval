little magazines-and academic libraries. little magazines
    present unique problems, due mainly to the difficulty of
    bibliographic verification and their uncertain lives. they are
    important sources of literature, however. an effort should be
    made to collect them, earmark funds for certain titles (perhaps
    beginning with a retrospective collection), and cooperate with
    other libraries in their acquisition.
