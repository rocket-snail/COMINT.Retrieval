the measurement of normal layer critical frequencies at
    night the normal layer critical frequency at night is best
    determined from absorption frequency curves plotted as results
    of typical measurements taken with standard absorption
    measuring equipment are shown from the trend of variation it
    was possible to identify the associated absorption band on a
    few of the routine night time curves obtained at slough in
    spite of the presence of and other irregularities from the
    variation of with time a recombination coefficient of about was
    deduced but owing to the low transmitter power measurements of
    could not be made further work with higher power is
    needed
