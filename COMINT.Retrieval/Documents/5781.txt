amplitude and angular scintillations of the radio source
    cygnus a observed at boulder colorado comparison with records
    from a suitably placed ionosonde shows correlation between
    scintillations and spread f but no with e the angular
    dependence of scintillations shows that the ionospheric during
    the day slow irregular variations of angle occur and are
    attributed to large scale lens like irregularities
