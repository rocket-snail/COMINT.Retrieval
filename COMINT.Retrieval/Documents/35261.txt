some properties of radio waves reflected from the moon
    and their relation to the lunar surface the properties of the
    echoes are described in terms of the correlation of the complex
    amplitudes of two sine waves at frequencies separated by
    reflected from the surface the correlation technique can be
    extended to two dimensional mapping of a rotating rough body a
    statistical model of the lunar sunface roughness is derived in
    which rms slopes of to are assumed
