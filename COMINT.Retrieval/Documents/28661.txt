a high precision ionospheric sounding equipment
    description with circuit diagrams and oscillograms of high
    resolution equipment which provides pulses variable from t in
    duration and from to in peak power the delta aerials are of the
    type considered by cones of alternative terminations giving
    improved signal strength at frequencies during conditions of
    severe interference a horizontal receiving dipole is used
    interchangeable receivers covering a bandwidth of are provided
    the timebase circuit previously described of is modified to
    give a line raster each line corresponding to height the
    evaluation of resolution is discussed in an appendix
