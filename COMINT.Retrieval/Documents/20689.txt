universal availability of publications in hungarian
    libraries. hungarian libraries have been organised in networks
    since the 1950s and more recently there have been efforts to
    coordinate acquisitions. the high cost of foreign publications
    is a problem. generous legal deposit laws compensate to some
    extent for union catalogue inadequacies. the national szechenyi
    library does not lend material, but acts as a switching centre.
    new regulations will increase the number of libraries lending
    material. 23% of requests are satisfied abroad. demand is at a
    relatively low level, but shows a steady growth. 2 new bodies,
    the central storage library and the central register of
    libraries, will bring some improvements.
