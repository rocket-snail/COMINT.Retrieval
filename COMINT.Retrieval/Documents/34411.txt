perceptions of the role of the school media specialist.
    describes the development and formative evaluation of an
    attitude questionnaire regarding perceptions of the role of
    public school media specialist/school librarian. the
    questionnaire was used to determine differences in expectations
    held by college and university level media educators,
    practising media specialists, principals, and teachers in an
    eastern alabama 10-district school consortium. the responses
    clearly demonstrated that the perceptions of the media
    educators are most divergent from those of the other
    groups.
