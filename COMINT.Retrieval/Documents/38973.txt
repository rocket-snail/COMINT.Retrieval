the practice of operations research in libraries. the
    application of operations research methods to library-type
    problems has a long history which predates the formation of the
    operations research society. its practice continues today but
    much of its emphasis has shifted from concern with the specific
    problems of a librarian or a library manager to the more
    general problems of designing large information networks and
    satisfying the information needs of large classes of users
    through a variety of services.
