formulae for ladder filters four related sets of explicit
    formulae for the elements of a basic low pass filter network
    are presented with a common notation three of the sets have
    been published previously of norton of of belevitch the fourth
    being new all have reference to the image parameter theory due
    to norton and darlington of if corresponding formulae could be
    found for a general type of filter with response depending on
    jacobian sn elliptic functions they would represent a
    considerable contribution to filter design technique
