an automatic recorder for measuring ionospheric
    absorption ionospheric absorption is deduced from the ratio of
    the amplitudes of singly and doubly reflected vertical
    incidence pulses the two pulses are separated by adjustable
    gates and applied to two logarithmic amplifiers followed by a
    difference circuit operating a chart recorder in the absence of
    a second reflection a local reference pulse can be used the
    system being calibrated subsequently
