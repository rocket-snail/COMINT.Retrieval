use of a cataloging center's bibliographic records as a
    means to check and balance acquisitions activities at an
    academic health sciences library. the acquisitions staff at
    wayne state university's shiffman medical library has developed
    a validation system based on the requests for cataloguing from
    the 5 teaching hospitals which are members of the detroit
    cooperative cataloging center (dc3). dc3 provides data on
    members' acquisition activites which have assisted in pointing
    up deficiencies in shiffman's book budget, and in assessing the
    adequacy of selective purchasing in the face of fiscal
    constraints. this system is being used to generate the kind of
    information needed by both acquisitions librarians and library
    administrators in order to make informed collection development
    decisions. report not available from ntis.
