library services for the sick and handicapped in finland.
    contribution to a finnish issue. the organisation of hospital
    and nursing home libraries in finland is based on the 1961
    library act, the relevant passages of which are probably
    derived from the experiences of those municipalities which have
    provided such services since the 1940s. the libraries are the
    responsibility of the local public library and receive higher
    government grants than the public library. the institution and
    public library cooperate closely in the library's day-to-day
    running. outlines the activities in such libraries,
    deficiencies, staff training, and library services for
    non-hospitalised handicapped people. the whole subject is being
    investigated by 2 working groups.
