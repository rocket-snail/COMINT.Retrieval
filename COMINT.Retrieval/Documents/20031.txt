field emission of electrons in discharges substantial
    emission of to electrons sec was obtained from cathodes of
    oxidized ni and w with electric fields of about cm by relating
    this emission to the electric field by the fowler nordheim
    equation the effective work function and emitting area of the
    source of the electrons for oxidized ni and w were estimated as
    about and respectively these results are discussed
