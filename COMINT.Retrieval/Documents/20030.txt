charting of dewey users in norway. in feb 79 the
    norwegian dewey committee sent a questionnaire to 179 public
    and special libraries, enquiring about their use of dewey
    and/or arnesen (norwegian version of dewey); editions used;
    size of collections; subject-headings lists used; indexes
    required; subject areas where dewey did not meet norwegian
    requirements; and additional aids desirable. the aim was to
    chart norwegian use of dewey and obtain help towards a new
    edition of arnesen and in the committee's future work. of 117
    libraries which replied, 77 used dewey and/or arnesen, many
    supplementing arnesen from other sources. several libraries
    specified problem fields, arnesen being found weakest in
    classes 300, 700 and 900. proposals included microcard indexes;
    current subject card catalogues; classification on publication;
    and periodical publication with continuing updating. the survey
    revealed a clear need for a new, extended edition of arnesen,
    and a likely increase in interest in dewey, the state library
    council having recommended dewey and udc as national
    classification policy.
