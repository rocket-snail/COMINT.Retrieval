loading of quartz oscillator plates an investigation was
    made of the effectiveness of mechanical loading for eliminating
    unwanted modes of vibration and adjusting the oscillation
    frequency towards the value corresponding to greatest activity
    the loading was done by applying various amounts of woods metal
    to different parts of the plate surfaces for concave thickness
    shear mode and x cut plates improvement was obtained when the
    loading was applied at or near the active central area for flat
    or convex x cut plates with an extensional mode of vibration
    improvement was obtained when the loading was applied near the
    periphery for both types loading increased the q factor
