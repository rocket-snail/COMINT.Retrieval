proposed negative mass microwave amplifier it is pointed
    out that negative masses occur in semiconductors at energies
    close to the band edge if the energy contours are reentrant
    there it is suggested that such a semiconductor might be used
    as the active element in a microwave amplifier although
    preliminary experiments with germanium did not show the effect
