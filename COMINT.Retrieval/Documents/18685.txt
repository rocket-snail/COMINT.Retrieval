an energy principle for hydromagnetic stability problems
    the problem of the stability of static highly conducting fully
    ionized plasmas is investigated by means of an energy principle
    developed from one introduced by lundquist of the method is
    applied to the general axisymmetric system and to plasmas which
    are completely separated from the magnetic field by an
    interface
