variation of the quality factor of piezoelectric crystals
    as a function of pressure measurements were made on a quartz
    crystal and on a rochelle salt crystal using apparatus
    described results are presented as curves for values of log
    decrease of pressure below about does nor affect value design
    of a toroidal cavity resonator by the method of curvilinear
    coordinates the application of the formulae derived is
    illustrated by a calculation of the resonance frequency of a
    cavity of given dimensions the calculated value agrees well
    with the experimental value restrictions on the shape factors
    of the step response of positive real system functions
    extension of previous analysis of the transient response of
