an electronic ratchet when groups of nine evenly spaced
    pulses are applied to a decade scaler a series of output pulses
    is obtained with separation increasing by one time unit for
    each pulse group application of groups of eight pulses gives
    separation increasing by two time units per groups of eleven
    pulses decrease the separation by a single unit the instrument
    described comprises two decade scalers and can provide a
    maximum separation of time units for increasing intervals or
    for decreasing intervals
