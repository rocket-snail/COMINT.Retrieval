design for library human resource development in zambia.
    (dlis dissertation-university of california at berkeley).
    reviews the sad history of the development of libraries,
    information services, and library education in zambia and
    presents data reflecting the low status of librarianship.
    concludes that there is a need for library human resource
    development planning and urges the relevant organisations to
    lobby for legislation and a national information policy and to
    work toward a better image for librarianship.
