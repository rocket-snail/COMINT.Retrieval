preliminary report on positional fluctuations of solar
    radio sources on mc an analysis indicates that the magnitude of
    the positional fluctuations is less when the solar rf source is
    closely connected with a magnetic field in the active region no
    increase in the magnitude of positional fluctuations was found
    on as the source moved towards the solar limb
