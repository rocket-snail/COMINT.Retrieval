a dipole absorber for centimetric electromagnetic waves
    with reduced reflection at oblique incidence the addition to a
    resonance absorber of arrays of dipoles parallel and
    perpendicular to the absorber surface minimizes reflection at
    oblique incidence experimental results and theory are
    given
