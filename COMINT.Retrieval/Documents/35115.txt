paramagnetic resonance and polarization of nuciei in
    metals a theory of paramagnetic resonance is proposed based on
    simultaneous solutions of maxwells equations and the kinetic
    equation for the density operator it is shown that the
    polarization varies with depth and also that the paramagnetic
    resonance gives rise to selective transparency in metallic
    films
