on extraordinary phenomena in a nonlinear forced
    oscillation the nonlinear forced oscillation represented by is
    discussed transforming the equation to the variational form the
    ritz method is applied to obtain the solution in the form of a
    fourier series in which extraordinary points of two different
    kinds are distinguished this method is applied to find the jump
    voltage of a circuit containing an iron cored reactor
