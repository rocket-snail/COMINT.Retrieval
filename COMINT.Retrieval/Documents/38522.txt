anode follower derivatives low output impedance stages
    characterized by anode output and feedback of the entire output
    voltage are derived from the basic anode follower by
    substitution of a vlve impedance for the shunt resistor of the
    feedback path or of a comparator stage for the entire input
    feedback potential divider and by replacement of the output
    valve by a series connected push pull pair these developments
    suggest the possibility of obtaining an anode follower analogue
    of each cathode follower derivative thereby increasing the
    number of circuit variants available for practical use
