    cybernetic, and developmental. library education has been part
    of the us higher education system since 1870. it remained
    popular until world war ii and then there was a sudden drop in
    popularity. it was revived only in the late 1950s and early
    60s. analyses the library education programme in terms of
    learning, teaching, curriculum and evaluation from cognitive,
    cybernetic and developmental perspectives. discusses a 3 part
    programme which was developed and implemented sucessfully at
    colgate university. programmes of the pennsylvania state
    university, ohio state university and university of denver are
    also discussed. the experience of librarians is that it is easy
    for students to learn the broader concepts of the usage of the
    library and do research, rather than remember many titles for
    each subject of their research.
