thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of a three level
    maser the analysis gives results which agree with those
    obtained by solving the rate equations explicit expressions are
    also obtained for the internal energy heat capacity and entropy
    the calculations are extended to include spontaneous emission
    and cross relaxation as well as the usual thermal
    relaxation
