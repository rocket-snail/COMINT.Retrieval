the art centre, used for the furnishing of hospital
    rooms. hospital patients can often only see bare walls;
    carefully chosen and attractive pictures help to provide a
    cultural environment and assist in convalescence. in
    cooperation with the art centre at weimar public library,
    weimar hospital borrows pictures for long-term loan, discussing
    requirements with patients and hospital staff. 2 years'
    experience has revealed that' pictures in rooms and corridors
    make the hospital seem more attractive; pictures for bed-ridden
    patients should be large and clearly visible, with colours and
    subjects that stimulate rather than excite, landscapes being
    especially popular; some patients will buy a copy of one of
    these pictures for themselves when they go home; and men and
    women often enjoy the same pictures.
