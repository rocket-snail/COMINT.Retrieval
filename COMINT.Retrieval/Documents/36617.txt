internationalism' and the children's literature community
    in the united states: a second look.p aper presented at the
    41st conference of the graduate library school, university of
    chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access to services and
    materials in school and public libraries. raises questions
    about the term 'internationalism' as it is used by those in the
    field of children's literature in the usa. it is most commonly
    applied to those activities which centre on some phase of
    children's literature outside the country. its use appears with
    greater frequency in articles on children's literature and
    seminar programmes. examination of children's literature
    textbooks, themes for doctoral theses presented 1930-79, and
    the status of language requirements in graduate library schools
    and colleges of education indicate that the internationalism of
    the field is inclined to be superficial.
