the development of school libraries in the czechoslovak
    socialist republic. school libraries in czechoslovakia came to
    life at the beginning of the last century, but their full
    development began after world war ii. in 1976 a reorganisation
    took place aimed at teaching pupils to find out required
    information independently and creatively. the implication of
    this with its resulting tasks for school libraries is
    discussed.
