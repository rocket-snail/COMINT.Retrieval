what my pupils taught me about children's books. report
    on a study by a sussex junior-school librarian of the library's
    policy of book provision. a questionnaire was presented to 90
    children in a local middle school on their reading interests.
    this pilot study enabled the librarian to alter the research
    design, notably by prompting increased pupil participation and
    an improved questionnaire. 258 children in the author's own
    school took a standardised comprehension test and completed the
    new questionnaire. a panel of children catalogued the school's
    4,793 books under 2 main classifications-fiction and
    information, and sorted them into 50 categories. discussions
    and decisions were taped. 1 in 20 books were assessed for their
    readability levels. a comparison of reading ages and
    readability levels of the books showed extensive mismatching of
    literature to pupils. detailed results are presented and
    analysed.
