current public library legislation in
    scandinavia-experiences and approaches to problems. a library
    commission on the reform of danish public library legislation
    presented its report in 1979, proposing a library act covering
    both public and special libraries, with a joint library
    directorate. all library stocks should be available through an
    inter-library loan centre. the national bibliography, at
    present produced in sections, should be taken over by the
    state. the free lending principle is maintained. public
    libraries, after a 5-year transitional period, should be wholly
    financed by the local authorities within 2 years. music
    libraries should be obligatory. proposed changes for special
    libraries emphasise a need for coordination. responsibility for
    school libraries would be transferred to the educational system
    under a recent act, in an attempt to unify the library system.
    all educational institutions would be obliged to establish and
    administer libraries suitable for their needs.
