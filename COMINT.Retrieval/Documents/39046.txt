lotka's law and the catalogue?. reports an attempt to
    corroborate w.g. potter's work on the application of lotka's
    law to the frequency of personal author entries in library
    catalogues (2see1 81/579). concludes that the findings support
    potter's suggestions that catalogues of larger libraries fit
    lotka's law more closely than those of smaller libraries and
    that the latter have a greater proportion of single-entry
    authors. discusses the practical implications of the
    findings.
