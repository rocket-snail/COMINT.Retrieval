variational principles in high frequency scattering two
    variational principles are formulated for two dimensional
    scattering by obstacles the more successful of these treats the
    obstacle like an aperture coupling two half spaces the zero
    order calculation for the cross section of a circle is found to
    have the correct frequency dependence
