the management of information systems. describes and
    presents the findings of the urban information systems (urbis)
    project, carried out in 1973-78 by the urbis research group of
    the public policy research organization, university of
    california, irvine. the project's purpose was to assess the
    state-of-the-art in local government computing, evaluate its
    impact on government services and management decision-making,
    and develop recommendations for the better use of information
    technology. computing in over 700 us cities and counties was
    studied extensively and more detailed information was then
    collected in 42 cities. it was found that well-managed computer
    technology has real pay-offs, but that it was not well-managed
    in most cities, creating pervasive problems and producing
    benefits far short of expectations.
