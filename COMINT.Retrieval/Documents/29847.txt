application of molecular beams to radio spectroscopic
    study of rotation spectra of molecules molecular beams may be
    used to obtain narrow spectral lines of width about and the
    rotation spectra of materials in the solid state quantitative
    estimates are made of the possibility of detecting the rotation
    transition in molecules at a frequency of using a spectroscope
    with a waveguide absorption cell and of the transition using a
    cavity resonator instrument see also of january
