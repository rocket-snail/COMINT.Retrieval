schoolteachers' view of children's books. a study
    prepared for the university of paris certificate in education,
    using observation, questionnaire and interview techniques on 17
    elementary school teachers. a preliminary discussion deals with
    the problems presented by children's literature, and the extent
    of the teacher's training in dealing with them. the
    investigation covered the teacher's sources of information
    about current children's books; the impact of publicity and
    publishers' selling techniques; the extent of the teacher's
    awareness of lack of information and how he tries to supplement
    it; the use of children's literature in the classroom, and
    attitudes to it; and criteria for choosing appropriate
    material. in general the survey showed the teacher to be badly
    informed and untrained in using children's literature.
