politics, libraries and uap. the first issue of 2slj'
    socialist librarians journal1 claims that there is a need for
    an international forum on librarianship from a socialist
    viewpoint, but fails to explain the basic tenets of socialist
    librarianship. reviews some of the recent literature on this
    topic, and suggests that libraries must, through free access
    and uap (universal availability of publications), allow every
    thinking person to be able to form his or her own opinion of
    the world and the society round them. whilst 2slj1 lacks
    ingenuity and is often incomprehensible, it also fails to
    indicate that socialism must require a solid philosophical and
    political infrastructure.
