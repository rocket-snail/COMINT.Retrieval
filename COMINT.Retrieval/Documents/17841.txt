statistical description of assemblies with collective
    interaction parts a critical review of literature on the
    subject is presented two types of assemblies of electrons and
    ions are distinguished those with a finite number of discrete
    beams with definite velocity and those with thermally
    disordered motion with or without superimposed beams
    investigations of the first type of assembly lead to
    satisfactory results the difficulties encountered in dealing
    with assemblies of the second type are due to neglecting the
    limitations of the models used the model of the dispersed
    charge carrier assembly presented by twiss of is then
    considered and the concepts of collision and the collision zone
    are discussed
