public welfare case records' a study of archival
    practices. the us federal-state welfare system, established by
    the 1935 social security act, has generated an enormous number
    of individual case files on welfare applicants and recipients,
    which are of great historical value. in 1978 a questionnaire
    was sent to all state archivists to identify current practices
    and principal problems encountered regarding the accessioning
    of public welfare case records. the study was restricted to
    federal-state categorical income maintenance programmes. a 92%
    response rate yielded data on the value of case records as
    research materials, whether or not state archives accession
    public welfare case records, primary problems presented by the
    records, and possible practicable solutions to these
    problems.
