changes in amplitude of the day variation in cosmic ray
    intensity during the solar cycle of activity the amplitude
    variation is in general agreement with the changes in solar
    activity assessed by the sunspot number only for the years and
    the poor correlation for the years may be explained by the
    changes in the electromagnetic conditions in interplanetary
    space during the solar cycle
