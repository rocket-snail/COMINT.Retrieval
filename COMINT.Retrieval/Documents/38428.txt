microwave discriminator stabilization of test bench a
    discriminator for stabilizing a reflex klystron operating at is
    discussed a small portion of the klystron output is applied to
    a cavity resonator and the sum and difference of the resonator
    response and the incident signal are used after detection and
    amplification to provide the control voltage for the keystron
    reflector electrclosed loop automatic phase control the method
    described of designing a phase control system for an oscillator
    is based on an application of techniques of servomechanism
