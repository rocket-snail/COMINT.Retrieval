how can we use library research?. introductions to a
    debate held at the 14th nordic library meeting in stockholm aug
    80. o. harbo distinguishes 4 types of library research and
    their uses. the most important is research in the library
    professional area, i.e. research into acquisition, storing and
    retrieval of information. the results can be used directly, or
    indirectly for the educational benefit of the person carrying
    out the research. many large development projects can only be
    carried out by central library bodies. m. okko points to the
    dangers of library research which is carried out for its
    usefulness only and iis directed by outside interests. the
    theoretical results of basic library science must permeate the
    professional thinking and practice. b. quentzer detects a
    mistrust of scientific thinking in libraries. education for
    librarianship must be changed so that it is more problem
    orientated and critical, thus an interest in library research
    can be built up. includes contributions to the debate by g.
    renborg and e. starfelt.
