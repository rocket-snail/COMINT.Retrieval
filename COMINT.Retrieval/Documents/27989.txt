anomalous changes in the ionosphere related to a severe
    magnetic storm oct examination of world wide geomagnetic and
    ionospheric data shows the existence of a short lived
    electrojet stream with associated anomalous changes in layer
    electron density two possible mechanisms are suggested the
    formation of a new layer due to corpuscular streams and the
    vertical drift of electrons resulting from interaction of the
    geomagnetic field with currents in the layer returning from the
    main electrojet in the e region see also of
