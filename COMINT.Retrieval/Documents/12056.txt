guidance of individual reading as a worthwhile activity.
    in a time when librarians have to work with large numbers of
    readers with demands of ever-increasing complexity, it is
    important to organise precisely the work of individual reading
    guidance. the process by which a reader selects a book can be
    broken down into various stages and decisions, and the
    librarian can exert a positive influence throughout the
    process. if the aims and stages of the librarian's guidance are
    planned schematically beforehand, it is possible to record each
    reader's progress and reactions in a concise coded system which
    is suitable for most public library situations.
