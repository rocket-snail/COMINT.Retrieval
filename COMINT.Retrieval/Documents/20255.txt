the anomalous skin effect in anisotropic metals
    application of the ineffectiveness concept of leads to the same
    answer as a sondheimers exact method above for spheroidal fermi
    surfaces and for a two dimensional isotropic metal a complete
    solution for the general case is given in a form which
    illustrates the potential value of anomalous skin effect
    studies as a tool in determining the shape of the fermi surface
    of a real metal
