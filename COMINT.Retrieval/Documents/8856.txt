the noise and gain properties of molecular and parametric
    amplifiers analysis is sufficiently general to include both
    types of amplifier as special cases the concepts of negative
    noise temperature and negative quality factor are introduced by
    analysing the energy exchange between a general sample of
    masser and a quantized cavity field the three level maser of
    bloembergen and the ferrimagnetic amplifier of suhl are
    discussed in some detail
