the interpretation of changes in the e and f layers
    during solar eclipses results obtained during a series of
    eclipses support an interpretation of ionospheric changes in
    terms of the response of a chapman layer to the obscuration of
    a solar disk where localized sources of ionizing radiation are
    superposed on a uniformly bright background an alternative
    hypothesis of a uniform disk and a complex layer with two
    different species of ion does not adequately explain observed
    characteristics experimental results indicate that errors due
    to layer tilts are probably not important see also above
