public libraries and networking' a bibliographic essay.
    most of the literature on the participation of public libraries
    in cooperative activities deals with their expansion from local
    entities to multitype systems. within the framework of this
    evolution, topics of special interest have been' appropriate
    units of service; legal and political considerations; stimulus
    of legislation; role of state library agencies; financial
    aspects; human factors; and automation in networking. the
    literature reviewed was vast but was deficient in comprehensive
    syntheses, in rigorous, large-scale evaluation of networking,
    and in studies focusing solely on public libraries.
