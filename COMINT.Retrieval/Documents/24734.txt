image parameter theory for mechanical quadripoles in
    compressional or torsional oscillation the equivalence of the
    parameters of a mechanical system transmitting compressional or
    torsional oscillations and the parameters of an electrical
    transmission line is established the design of mechanical
    filters is described and design formulae with response
    characteristics are given for the basic filter sections
