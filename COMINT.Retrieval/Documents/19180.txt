a review of the development and potential of the public
    library system in east africa. (mls dissertation.) to examine
    whether the high technology library system favoured by the west
    is applicable to developing countries, it is necessary to study
    the history of public library development in a particular area,
    its current status, and its planned future development. the
    east african community (kenya, uganda, and tanzania) was chosen
    for this study as its library development has been sufficiently
    long to enable a cause-and-effect analysis. in future, there
    must be a balance between acceptance of apposite western ideas
    and rejection of those ideas harmful to the community.
    financial support is becoming more assured; the recognition of
    local requirements must follow.
