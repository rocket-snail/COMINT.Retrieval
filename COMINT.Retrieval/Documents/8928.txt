the isograph an electronic root finder the instrument
    described is designed on the principle of harmonic synthesis
    short circuited and open circuited delay lines fed from a
    matched frequency sweep generator being use to produce the sine
    and cosine terms respectively by controlling the amount of
    frequency sweep any desired interval of the argument can be
    expanded and the accuracy of measurement thus increased
