on the discrimination of a synchronized oscillator
    against interference accompanying the synchronizing signal the
    response of the oscillator to an interfering signal is
    investigated when the interference component of the oscillator
    output is small the response is found to be linear and the
    discrimination is expressed analytically the experimental
    results are in good agreement with theory
