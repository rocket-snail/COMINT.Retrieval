comparison of junction transistor and amplifier valve the
    quadripole equations are developed for the commonly used
    circuits important parameters and relations are tabulated for
    linear operation the valve can be regarded from the network
    point of view as a simplified limiting case of the class
    containing both valves and transistors analysis of a
    regenerative amplifier with distributed amplification analysis
    indicates that the application of distributed amplification in
    regenerative circuits such as the monostable multivibrator is
    limited by its inherent time delay
