the reproduction of voltage pulses by means of a
    proportional amplifier analysis of an amplifier for nuclear
    physics investigations is based on laplace transformations a
    characteristic transmission function is introduced which
    completely describes the transmission properties of the
    amplifier and represents the combined pulse distorting
    influences of the individual circuit elements the transmission
    functions of single stage and multistage amplifiers are derived
    and a detailed and a detailed exposition is given of the
    distortion experienced by a typical exponential decay pulse
    optimum reproduction of such a pulse requires a particular
    relation between pulse duration and the time constants of the
    amplifier circuits improvement of time resolution involves
    closer restriction of this relation and greater complexity of
    circuits use of negative feedback offers advantages a two stage
    feedback amplifier is a useful unit in a large amplifier system
    the transmission function can alternatively be determined from
    the response of the amplifier to steady alternating voltage a
    suitable method of measurements is described
