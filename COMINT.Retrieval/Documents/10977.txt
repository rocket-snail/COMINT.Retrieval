representation of the general linear four terminal
    network and some of its properties non reciprocal networks are
    considered equations are formulated in terms of power and
    impedance a method of representation is developed based on
    introduction f a circuit element called the anti reciprocal
    transition in series with a reciprocal network power
    attenuation and matching are investigated a new criterion for
    classifying networks as passive or active is proposed a
    grounded emitter transistor amplifier is discussed as a
    particular application of the theory
