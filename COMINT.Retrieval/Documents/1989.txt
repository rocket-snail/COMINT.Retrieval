staffing in nigerian university libraries. describes a
    study undertaken to ascertain to what extent academic
    librarians in nigeria satisfy the bibliographical and
    information requirements of scholarship and research, and
    whether the institutional settings in which staff work are
    conducive to effective professional service. among major
    elements examined were the librarians' perceptions of their
    responsibilities; their academic and professional backgrounds;
    work environments; job satisfaction and opportunities for
    continuing education and professional development. it was found
    that professional library service has been hindered by the
    inability of the library administrators to conceptualise the
    proper role of a librarian; rigid bureaucratisation in the
    libraries; failure to separate professional from
    non-professional duties; and by limited incentives and
    opportunities for continuing education and professional
    growth.
