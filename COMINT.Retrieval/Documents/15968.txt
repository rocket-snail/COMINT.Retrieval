introducing online data base searching in the small
    academic library: a model for service without charge to
    undergraduates. the impact on small academic libraries of
    searching periodical indexes on-line has not been as widespread
    as that of bibliographic instruction, resource sharing, or
    oclc. bibliographic instruction was integrated easily into
    normal work routines and oclc was relatively inexpensive, but
    on-line searching does not appear to offer such advantages and
    learning to operate a terminal can seem to be alien. describes
    the introduction of on-line search facilities at lake forest
    college, a small liberal arts establishment with a faculty of
    100 and 1,000 students. the facility was initiated with the
    help of a research grant, but has since earned sufficient
    faculty and administration support to ensure its
    continuation.
