surviving the eighties: new roles for publishers,
    information service organizations, and users. (the 1980 miles
    conrad memorial lecture, presented at the 22nd nfais
    conference, 5 mar 80.) new technology will not see the
    extinction of publishers, information service organisations and
    users during the 1980s, but a change of roles and
    interrelationships. explores this theme for each of the groups,
    and contends that the economy will be healthier in the 80s,
    with better and cheaper information products and services if we
    can find ways to take full advantage of the diversity,
    know-how, creativity and financial resources of the private
    sector without impacting adversely on services, such as public
    libraries, that will continue to require the financial support
    of federal, state and local government.
