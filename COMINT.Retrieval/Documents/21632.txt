integrating and differentiating circuits applications to
    filtering and to z acoustics the basic circuits and the effect
    of successive operations on speech and music signals are
    considered a detailed study is made of an if band stop filter
    derived by linear combination of differentiating and
    integrating circuits its applications in a distortion meter
    selective amplifier and df oscillator are described
