the northwestern africana project' an experiment in
    decentralized bibliographic and authority control. the
    northwestern africana project was designed to demonstrate that
    a system of decentralised bibliographic-control centres could
    be an effective method for building a comprehensive, consistent
    national data base for use in a national library network.
    utilising funding granted by the national endowment for the
    humanities and by the carnegie corporation, northwestern
    university, illinois, sought to show that a high-quality data
    base, that is, one that conforms to library of congress
    cataloguing standards and heading usage, could be prepared and
    maintained at a location remote from lc. the data base would be
    transmitted to a central location for incorporation into a
    common data base and for distribution.
