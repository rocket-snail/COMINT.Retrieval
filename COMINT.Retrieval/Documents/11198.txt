coils for magnetic fields a comparison between wire wound
    foil wound and coaxial cable wound solenoids considering the
    limitations of temperature rise and weight equations relating
    field power and internal temperature difference are obtained
    from which the performance of any coil can be calculated the
    relative advantages of al or cu windings are considered
