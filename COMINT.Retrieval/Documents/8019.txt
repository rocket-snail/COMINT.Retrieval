geomagnetic rotational retardation of satellite radio
    observations indicated a rapid exponential retardation of
    satellite rotation analysis of couples acting on the conducting
    and magnetic parts of the satellite gives a value for the mean
    ambient geomagnetic field and confirms the eddy current theory
