recursive solution of a class of combinatorial problems:
    an example combinatorial problems requiring the selection of n
    elements from a set of m elements may be solved by a recursion
    process analogous to that for computing binomial coefficients.
    several specific problems are analyzed, the general technique
    is exposed, and an algol program is developed for one of the
    problems. october, 1965 lynch,w. c. ca651009 jb march 6, 1978
