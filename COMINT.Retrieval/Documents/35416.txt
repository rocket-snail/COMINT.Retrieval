a universal nonlinear filter predictor and simulator
    which optimizes itself by a learning process after a discussion
    of some cybernetic principles a machine is described which by a
    process of successive runs on an input function ultimately
    produces a target function with least error the machine
    incorporates a tra k tape recorder and analogue multipliers of
    a novel piezomagnetic type which perform multiplications per
    second with errors not exceeding and
