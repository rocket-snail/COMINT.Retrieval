observations of the lower ionosphere during the solar
    eclipse on propagation tests were made at on frequencies of
    during the eclipse the expected increase of reflection
    coefficient in the lower ionosphere was considerably delayed
    after first contact and normal attenuation values were restored
    before the end of the eclipse the magnitude of the effect and
    the delay of the maximum agreed with predictions from normal
    diurnal and seasonal variations based on a single layer model
    of the layer but the limited duration of the effect was
    consistent with a multilayer model observations of complex
    variations of very long wave ve atmospherics are also
    reported
