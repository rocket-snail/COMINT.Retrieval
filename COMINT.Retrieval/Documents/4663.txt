children in hospital. contribution to an issue devoted to
    public library services in sweden. for hospitalised children
    the library functions as a place for recreation-somewhere
    allowing them respite from being regarded primarily as
    patients. librarians working in hospitals should be aware of
    the unique possibility they have of reaching and stimulating
    children who would seldom visit a public library under normal
    circumstances.
