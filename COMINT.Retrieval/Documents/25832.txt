note on the series correction of wide band amplifiers a
    variation of the series inductance correction circuit is
    considered in which the load resistance is connected across the
    output and the circuit designed for either maximally flat
    transfer impedance or maximally flat input impedance
    inconvenient ratios of input t output capacitance can be
    avoided by using a cathode follower stage
