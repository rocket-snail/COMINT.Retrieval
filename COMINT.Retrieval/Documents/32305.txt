providing a mobile library service to ethnic minorities.
    a mobile library service is only likely to have to cater for
    ethnic minorities in urban areas. after the local ethnic
    minorities have been identified a reasonable stock of books in
    the appropriate languages must be included bearing in mind that
    several ethnic minorities are english-speaking e.g. west
    indians. stocks of books for ethnic minorities must perforce be
    limited since ethnic minorities also read books originating
    from the dominant culture' a surfeit would also alienate the
    non-ethnic minority users. the problem of stock selection of
    foreign language books can be overcome by using ethnic minority
    staff.
