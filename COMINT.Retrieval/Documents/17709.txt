self-censorship in collection development by high school
    library media specialists. study of the practice of
    self-censorship by librarians in us secondary school library
    media centres. questionnaires were sent to 718 librarians and
    478 usable returns were collected. librarians seem, in their
    selection, to avoid controversial titles; the identification of
    the absence of controversial titles from the librarians'
    collections was not uniformly a signal for the ordering of
    titles; and the presence of large numbers of restricted access
    materials again indicates librarians' reluctance to face
    censorship battles.
