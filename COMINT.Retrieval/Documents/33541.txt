evaluation methodology for data bases in agricultural
    sciences. report of a study comparing agricola, agris and cab,
    intended primarily to establish selection criteria for use and
    acquisition. references were retrieved relating to 11 different
    products, by each of the 3 data bases singly, and in
    combinations of 2, and compared for duplication and diversity.
    details are given of initial hypotheses, and materials and
    methods used. results are presented in full, and an index of
    duplication calculated, showing which combination of 2 out of 3
    data bases is the most efficient. the data obtained were also
    used to investigate publication languages and counties of
    origin of articles. refinements of the methodology used are
    suggested.
