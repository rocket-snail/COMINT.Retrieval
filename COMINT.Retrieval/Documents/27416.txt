magnetic disturbances and the earths magnetic field storm
    time changes in the earths magnetic field could induce currents
    in the earths core which interact with the steady field this
    produces a nett unidirectional current at the end of the
    disturbance which penetrates gradually down to the core and has
    a decay time of a million years this current could be
    responsible for maintaining the steady field
