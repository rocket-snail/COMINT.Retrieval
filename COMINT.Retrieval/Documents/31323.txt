the integrated library system of the future. present-day
    libraries and librarians face serious problems of economics,
    politics, and technology. adequate funding is in short supply
    while librarians do not act effectively in the political
    environment, and technology threatens to lead librarians rather
    than follow. using the analogy of a business office, the author
    proposes an integrated library system of the future with 3
    components; the library, the job, and the home.
