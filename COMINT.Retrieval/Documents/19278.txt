one word more about cosiness.. describes gentofte main
    public library and interviews librarians, users and the
    cultural committee chairman. the 1st impression of cosiness is
    dispelled on closer examination, which reveals gross
    overcrowding in staff working areas. the present building was
    erected in 1928 and additions were soon necessary. the
    children's section, the catalogue department and the stacks are
    placed elsewhere with ensuing transport problems. several plans
    for a new library have been stopped by government cuts, despite
    local political goodwill. however, gentofte library service as
    a whole is well provided, with 5 branch libraries, art library,
    spoken newspaper, domiciliary lending service, hospital
    service, central guest workers' collection, and arrangements
    for adults and children. the cuts have come at a time of
    increasing loans, but still leave the library above average in
    materials and staff. describes the 2 year experiment which
    began at gentofte on 1 mar 81 with on-line se arching using the
    dialog and euronet data bases. the library receives about 2,000
    subject enquiries from other libraries in the county; only
    those which are deemed at a sufficiently high level (15%) are
    dealt with by the computer.
