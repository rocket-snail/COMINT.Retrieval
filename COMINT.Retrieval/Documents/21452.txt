reading and libraries in the socio-cultural life of an
    urban black community. to obtain a broad socio-cultural
    perspective of the role of reading and public library use in an
    urban black community in south africa, the reading, public
    library use and communications habits of a random sample of 406
    households and of 123 adult library members (all in pretoria)
    were studied. the findings indicate that the lifestyle of the
    library users as a group is significantly different from that
    of the general black population and that library users
    communicate more broadly (through talking with people outside
    the immediate family, participating in community activities,
    and using a variety of media).
