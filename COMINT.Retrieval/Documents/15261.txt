analogue digital computers a comparison the operation of
    analogue computers is described the problem of simulation in
    real time is used as a basis for comparing analogue and digital
    computers in respect of speed accuracy convenience the
    mathematical operations discussed include addition subtraction
    multiplication division evaluation of polynomials and other
    functions extraction of square roots and solution of
    differential equations
