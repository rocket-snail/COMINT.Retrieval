self-made is well made' on-line catalogue access in the
    northwestern university library. describes the us northwestern
    university library's computer system, which uses the
    university's central computer. the first phase of the
    northwestern on-line totally integrated system, (notis), was
    begun with the library's move to a new building in 1970. this
    was an issue control system and was followed by automation of
    most technical routines. under development is the library user
    information service, (luis), a system which allows on-line
    searching in the library's catalogue of acquisitions since
    1970. the card catalogue is, however, being maintained meantime
    as luis does not allow subject searches, nor has full
    bibliographic details. although cost effectiveness of
    automation prior to its introduction had not been considered
    the system has been smoothly installed and had led to increased
    productivity in the technical department. there was general
    satisfaction with the fact that the library had been ab le to
    create a well functioning, independent system.
