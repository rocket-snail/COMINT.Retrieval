studies of auroral echoes part the results of radar
    observations at kjeller and tromso are discussed the velocity
    and direction of the drift of auroral ionization was measured
    by the technique used at n jodrell bank by byllough and kaiser
    of in which the time variation of echoes observed on aerials
    directed nw and ne is recorded an interferometer was used to
    measure fine structure and a vertically sliding aerial to
    measure the angle of elevation of the arriving echoes the
    observed drift and structure at kjeller was similar to that at
    jodrell bank but was more irregular at tromso
