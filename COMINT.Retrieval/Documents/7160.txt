cut off attenuators for waveguide circuits an equivalent
    circuit analysis and report of measurements on short and long
    cut off sections providing attenuation respectively less than
    and greater than db beyond a certain length the reduction in
    attenuation due to reflections at the junction is constant so
    that calibration measurements on long sections are
    unnecessary
