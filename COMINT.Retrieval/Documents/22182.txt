the initial radius of meteoric ionization trails kinetic
    theory is applied to the formation of regions of ionized and
    neutral atoms of meteoric material about the path of a meteor
    it is found that the high initial velocity of the diffusing
    particles causes the trail to reach an initial radius quickly
    and normal diffusion then ensues a reflected signal may be
    computed as if the initial radius mean free paths were reached
    instantaneously
