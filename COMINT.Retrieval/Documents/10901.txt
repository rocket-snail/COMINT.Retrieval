relay scanning design technique generates high accuracy
    and speed in analogue to digital transducer measurements the
    converter is designed to handle three decades of binary decimal
    pulses each decimal unit is equivalent to input the converter
    scans an internal voltage until it becomes equal to the
    unamplified input voltage and supplies a serial pulse
    output
