resistance network analogues with unequal meshes or
    subdivided meshes a general method for deriving the finite
    difference approximations to the partial differential equation
    which is solved by resistance network analogues is applied to
    find the resistance values and the currents which have to be
    fed in for and networks with unequal mesh sizes two ways of
    subdividing a network into finer meshes in the ratio are then
    given and a network subdivision in the ratio is described
    experimental tests have shown that these subdivisions introduce
    negligible errors into the measured field distributions
