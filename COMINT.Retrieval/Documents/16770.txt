some thoughts on the dewey decimal classification.
    discusses the problems arising from the basic conflict in all
    classification namely the need for stability on one hand and
    for development on the other. urges that there be a single,
    current edition of the dewey decimal classification at longer
    intervals together with a controlled programme of officially
    sponsored pilot schedules for priority disciplinary
    revisions.
