an analysis of the magnetic second subharmonic oscillator
    the analysis refers to a parametric oscillator with two
    ferromagnetic cores the steady state operation with both
    current and voltage pump drives is studied to determine the
    values of the circuit parameters which will give subharmonic
    oscillations the experimental waveforms are close to those
    predicted
