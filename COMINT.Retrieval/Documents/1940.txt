synthesis of narrow band direct coupled filters a general
    synthesis procedure is described that is based on an
    approximate first order equivalence between direct coupled and
    coupled filters the transmission characteristics computed for a
    cavity filter with an overall q of are in excellent agreement
    with measurements
