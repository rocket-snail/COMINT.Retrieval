the radiation greens functions analysis for the radiation
    field of a group of charges is derived using functions similar
    to the greens function of potential theory but applied to the
    time variables problems of radiation theory the method presents
    a model of interaction between a quantum of movement of a unit
    point charge and the corresponding excitation of a set of eigen
    fields it is illustrated by treating the case of a point charge
    rotating in a cylindrical cavity
