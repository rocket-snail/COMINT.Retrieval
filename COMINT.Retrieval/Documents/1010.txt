theory of high frequency discharge in gases at low
    pressures calculation of electron distribution function the
    electron distribution is obtained by resolving boltzmanns
    equation by a method of successive approximations considering
    both elastic and inelastic collisions the electron temperature
    corresponding to a maxwellian velocity distribution is derived
    and the general form of evolution of electronic density is
    given
