stabilizer for control of high direct voltages the
    development and performance of a stabilizer for direct voltages
    of the order of several thousands of volts are described the
    application of the stabilizer to voltages of any value using as
    variable resistor a large number of triode valves in series
    suppressing the voltage divider bridge generally used to
    control the regulator system is also discussed rectifier ripple
    can be eliminated so that a simple type of filter can be
    used
