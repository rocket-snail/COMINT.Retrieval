the library bill and the danish library association. the
    official statement of the danish library association on the
    ministry of culture's library bill of 24 sept 81. the
    association supports this proposal, but with some reservations.
    thus it supports the inclusion of both public and research
    libraries in one act, but opposes the decision to remove school
    libraries. it supports the proposed amalgamation of the library
    inspectorate and the office of national librarian, and the
    establishment of a library council, albeit with a different
    composition. it would have liked to see art collections put on
    a par with music collections, and library provision for
    intermediate education and outreach activities made obligatory.
    the library centre, of whose board the association has a
    majority membership, is willing to cooperate in discussions on
    the administration of the national bibliography and urges that
    its financing be clarified soon. the association regards the
    amount set aside for transition of p art-time libraries to
    full-time status too low. it supports the change to block grant
    financing.
