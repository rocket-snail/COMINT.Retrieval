to grow or not to grow?. enumerates and comments on the
    many factors that cause increased need for academic library
    space. since the collection occupies only from 25-45% of the
    floorspace in large academic libraries, these other factors
    must also be studied and remedied in order to limit building
    growth. the following measures to slow the increase in storage
    space are reviewed in detail' weeding; zero-growth; compact
    storage; coordinated acquisitions; miniaturisation. in
    connection with the arrangement of stored materials, detailed
    arguments are cited why browsing is an insufficient retrieval
    device for serious research. the point is made that a
    combination of the above measures is needed to reduce space
    pressures inherited from the past. furthermore, in
    acknowledgement of the studies showing that a high proportion
    of acquired works is rarely if ever used, a more limited and
    regionally coordinated selection policy is needed to reduce
    future space pressures.
