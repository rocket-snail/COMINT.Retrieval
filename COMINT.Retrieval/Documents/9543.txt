a practical method of designing active filters a method
    for designing filters for the frequency range below about with
    sharp cut off is based on consideration of five basic variables
    namely two resistances tow capacitances and the gain from these
    further practical parameters are derived by taking the products
    of resistance and capacitance the ratio of resistances and the
    ratio of capacitances the active elements can in many cases be
    simple cathode follower circuits design data for a number of
    different cases are tabulated
