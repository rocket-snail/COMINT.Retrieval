the theory of electromagnetic waves in a crystal in which
    excitons are produced it is shown that in a crystal several
    waves of the same frequency polarization and propagation
    direction exist but with different indices of refraction this
    phenomenon differs from double refraction of light and occurs
    even in isotropically polarizing cubic crystals
