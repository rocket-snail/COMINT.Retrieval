some characteristics of the d region ionization during
    auroral activity in north sweden d layer ionization during
    aurorae is closely associated with sudden increases in auroral
    activity and extends down to about sixty five km the latitude
    variations of this layer are discussed and it seems likely that
    the ionization is due both to primary electrons and secondary x
    rays
