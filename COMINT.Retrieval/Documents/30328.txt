scattering of electromagnetic waves by lo g cylinders the
    field scattered by a metal or dielectric cylinder when excited
    by a wave propagated in a direction normal to the cylinder axis
    is discussed theoretically for plane and cylindrical waves the
    radius of the cylinder is comparable with the wave length the
    dielectric cylinder is a resonant structure
