computer storage and retrieval of generic chemical
    structures in patents. i. introduction and general strategy.
    the strategy of an approach to representing and searching the
    generic chemical formulas (markush formulas) typical of
    chemical patents is outlined. the methods under development
    involve the following stages' (1) the description of generic
    chemical expressions by means of a formal language, gensal; an
    approach to the generation and recognition of substituents or
    radicals defined by generic nomenclatural expressions, via
    formal grammars; (3) methods for automatic generation of screen
    characteristics, individually and within the relational and
    logical frameworks defined by generic formulas; (4) search
    techniques for identification of specific structures and
    substructures within generic formulas based on these
    methods.
