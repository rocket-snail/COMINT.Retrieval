an rms sensitive phase shifting circuit a circuit
    delivering an output whose phase depends on the rms value of
    the input uses a tungsten filament diode as rms current
    detector the diode is operated with voltage on the anode n and
    a voltage derived from the ac component of anode current is
    added to a fixed voltage to give the resultant variable phase
    output applications for control purposes are mentioned
