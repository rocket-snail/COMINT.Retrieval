external lending statistics for libraries in north
    rhine-westphalia and northern rhineland palatinate in 1979. the
    north rhine-westphalia union catalogue office at the university
    library centre published the 1979 report concerning external
    lending and borrowing statistics. 175 libraries in the region
    were authorised lending libraries in 1979. the union catalogue
    office sent questionnaires to 273 libraries, departments and
    grammar schools in the region. 270 of these were completed and
    returned. the number of inter-library loans levelled off in
    comparison to the high 1976 figures and dropped in some cases.
    there were some exceptions such as the cologne
    zentralbibliothek der medizin which had a growth rate of 13%.
    there was a rise in books ordered by libraries from other
    libraries of 3.7%. a considerable difference between the number
    of books lent to other libraries in west germany and abroad was
    evident. more books were borrowed by the regional libraries
    than were supplied by them and the figures for books supplied
    dropped in comparison to earlier statistics.
