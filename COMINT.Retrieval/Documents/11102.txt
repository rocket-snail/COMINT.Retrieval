definition and measurement of the mean field of pulse
    type atmospherics the mean effect on a receiver with tuned
    circuits and linear detection of short pulses at is very
    similar to that of an em field with an effective electric
    component eing the effective height of the aerial for the
    aerial for the frequency to which the receiver is tuned
