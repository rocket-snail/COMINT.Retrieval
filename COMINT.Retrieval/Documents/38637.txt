anomalous ionospheric reflection during solar eclipses
    analysis of electron densities during an eclipse shows that
    while the slope and curvature of layer strata are mostly very
    small effective discontinuities can occur which would produce
    complexities in ionograms these complexities are due to rays
    reflected along paths inclined to the vertical
