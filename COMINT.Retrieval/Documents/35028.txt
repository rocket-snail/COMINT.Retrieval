fees for online bibliographic search services in
    publicly-supported libraries. on-line bibliographic searching
    is an important recent innovation in library services. the
    choices that libraries have made in adopting this service have
    important implications for future library services. their
    decisions about whether, when, and how to charge the user
    reveal their judgements about the appropriate role of user
    fees. the ways in which libraries have integrated on-line
    searching into more traditional library services have
    implications for future technology-based innovations. a
    california library association survey of publicly-supported
    libraries found a large number offering searches, nearly half
    at no charge to the users; and that user fees differed
    according to where the search was performed and whether the
    user or the librarian was seen as its primary beneficiary.
    public and academic libraries appeared to have 2 different
    service patterns.
