starting library research!. interviews john p. wilkinson,
    leader of the centre for research in librarianship, toronto,
    who describes his career in librarianship and the establishment
    of the centre in 1975. the centre is supported financially by
    funded research only, but is helped also by its proximity to
    canada's largest research library at the university of toronto.
    for a research project in librarianship to be successful, the
    problem must be of current interest so that it can attract
    funds, it must be an area in which one specialises, and help
    must be sought from other experts. explains what a research
    problem is and how it is formulated in terms of the whole
    research process. discusses the research into the relationship
    between personality traits and effective library management,
    and argues that researchers should resolve problems which
    hinder decision-making, but they should not make the decisions
    themselves. research methods is a compulsory subject in the
    university's mls programme, stressing the importance of
    research if librarianship is to become a professional social
    science discipline.
