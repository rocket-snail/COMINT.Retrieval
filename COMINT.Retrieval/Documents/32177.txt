the people want pap, or ideas for an alternative form of
    library work. a young librarian challenges his colleagues to
    question the attitude that they have held towards their work
    until now. public libraries are at present in a blind alley.
    librarians have forgotten that books are not simply the sources
    of certain ideas' they are also goods subject to the laws of
    marketing, hence the predominance of best-sellers and trivial
    material on the market. it is wrong to value the ability to
    read above that of playing football; what is vital is
    discrimination and sensitivity towards the actual contents of
    the material read. librarians are after all responsible for all
    their actual and potential readers, by whom their work is
    financed.
