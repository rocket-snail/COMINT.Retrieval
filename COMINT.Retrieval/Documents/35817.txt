a high speed waveform sampling circuit pulsed sampling
    circuits are discussed for obtaining a quantized output
    corresponding to a continuously varying input voltage a cathode
    follower with negative feedback is used to provide an
    arrangement giving sz satisfactory operation with sampling
    pulses of short duration and small amplitude a diode switch
    circuit leads from the cathode follower to the input of a sign
    reversing amplified between whose input and output terminals
    the storage capacitor is connected
