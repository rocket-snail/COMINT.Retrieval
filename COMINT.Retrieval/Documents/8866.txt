the space charge retardation of electron avalanches the
    electric field generated by the positive and negative space
    charge of a single electron avalanche moving in a homogeneous
    electric field is calculated a growth formula is derived which
    differs from the townsend formula good agreement is obtained
    between the theoretical results and statistical data given by
    other authors
