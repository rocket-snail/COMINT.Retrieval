ac controlled magnetic amplifiers a method is described
    for controlling full wave amplifiers with ac signals the
    response characteristic is similar to that of dc controlled
    amplifiers and high gain is achieved with no current limiting
    resistors or demodulator the method is based on cancelling the
    induced emf in the control circuit
