getting down to 2%: books for rural scotland. 2% of the
    mainland scottish population are spread over 70% of the land.
    this relatively low population density and geographical
    complications limit the potential of rural mobile libraries;
    there are no standards; and there is no philosophy of mobile
    service and its role in the community. a questionnaire was sent
    to scottish authorities running mobile services and several
    were visited to obtain information on policies concerning
    mobiles; usage; time spent at stops, travelling, and on
    maintenance; staffing; issue figures; book selection; other
    stock; stock changes; issue system; vehicle care; problems;
    other rural services; effect of mobile costs on future role and
    extent of mobile services; and effects of budget cuts. the
    results are discussed.
