direct voltage stabilizers in the range with particular
    reference to degenerative systems the maximum usable loop gain
    depends on the frequency response of the system in practice
    loop gains of the order of are possible the effects of mains
    voltage and load current fluctuations are reduced by this
    factor reference elements are reviewed but electron energy
    analysers give comparable stability with smaller size and
