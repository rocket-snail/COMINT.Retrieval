diffusion and elastic collision losses of the fast
    electrons in plasmas when the energy spectrum in ne at mm hg
    pressure can be separated into a primary high energy and a
    secondary low energy maxwellian group then the mean free path
    of the fast electrons can be evaluated by use of the diffusion
    law is found to be independent of the plasma density it is
    remarkable that there is little interaction between fast and
    slow groups even when the density of the slow one becomes
    comparable to or even higher than that of the fast group
