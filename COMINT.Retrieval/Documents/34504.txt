the collection of historical children's books in the
    international children's library in munich. this library
    contains 1 of the 3 largest collections of historical
    children's books in germany, which are currently being
    catalogued by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft (german
    research association). the other collections are at brunswick
    technical university and the institute for research into
    children's literature at frankfurt university. the library in
    munich was founded in 1948 by jella lepman who encouraged the
    collection of an international range of modern material and the
    acceptance of books as gifts from publishers, institutions and
    private individuals. walter scharf, who succeeded her in 1958,
    began collecting historical as well as contemporary works and
    acquired several large collections from other libraries. the
    munich collection provides comprehensive coverage of
    publications from the last 100 years and illustrates the
    importance of reflecting all production trends. there are sti
    ll gaps in the coverage of material from before 1850.
