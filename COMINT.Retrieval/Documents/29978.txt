stable frequency dividers using thyrite elements locked
    oscillator frequency dividers using nonlinear thyrite elements
    as load impedors are described with slight circuit
    modifications a stable locking action is obtainable for
    division by any number between and no circuit adjustments are
    required as the valves age dividers have been constructed for
    frequencies up to
