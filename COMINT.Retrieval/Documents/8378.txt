the programme for library research completed. the library
    high school's working party on library research has now
    completed its work and drawn up a programme. the background to
    the work was the reform of higher education in 1977, which
    encouraged research, giving priority to' development of
    foundation courses which encourage the students to make use of
    new research results, further training of lecturers, and
    improvement of facilities for lecturers to follow current
    research. the working party at its 1st meeting in aug 78
    adopted these guidelines' to examine existing educational plans
    to see how far they promote student use of library research; to
    establish contact with international research; to promote
    research skills among teachers of librarianship; to initiate
    research projects. a permanent seminar for library research was
    set up in 1978 and participants were sent on courses and
    conferences. an examination of on-going library-relevant
    research in swedish scientific institutions was made and to
    facilitate the monitoring of this research a computer based
    index' nordic bdi index, has been created. it remains to plan a
    course bridging the training of librarians and researchers in
    the library and information field.
