an evaluative, holistic, and user-oriented approach to
    assessing and monitoring effectiveness of the academic library
    in its setting. describes research undertaken to broaden the
    theoretical base on which effectiveness of library services can
    be determined, to translate findings into operational terms,
    and to test operationally a system of assessing and monitoring
    effectiveness on the basis of the findings. the methodology
    developed was centred on a library user questionnaire in which
    the users were asked to rate the relative importance, level of
    user satisfaction, user benefit, and effectiveness of each
    library service. the questionnaire was tested in a college,
    with promising results. this line of research is
    continuing.
