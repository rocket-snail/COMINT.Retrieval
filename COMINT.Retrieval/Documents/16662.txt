transient behavior in a ferroresonant circuit an analysis
    is made of the response to a sinusoidal voltage of a circuit
    including a nonlinear inductor for certain frequency values of
    the applied voltage there are three possible values for for the
    flux in the inductor of which the middle value is unstable the
    differential equation representing the circuit has been solved
    using an analogue computer for the case when the system is
    released in the region of the lower stable state the solution
    corresponds to two sinusoidal oscillations of different
    amplitude and frequency if the system is released in the region
    of the upper stable state the solution corresponds to an
    oscillation modulated in amplitude and phase for certain values
    of the parameters
