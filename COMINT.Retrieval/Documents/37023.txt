an automated system of semantic information distribution.
    the principles of constructing an automated adaptive
    information retrieval and distribution system based on a
    semiotic model are considered. this model derives from the same
    principles as those underlying relational languages of facet
    and block classifications. the semantic analysis and
    distribution of documents, the general technological scheme of
    the system, and algorithms of its basic circuit are described.
    the possibility of the application of a semiotic model to sdi
    is demonstrated.
