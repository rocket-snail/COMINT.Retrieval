a ferromagnetic resonance frequency converter an
    experimental and theoretical study of a converter using a
    magnetized disk of single crystal yttrium iron garnet inputs at
    and are used to produce an output at in a cavity resonant at
    all three frequencies the output power agrees with that
    expected theoretically within experimental error see also
