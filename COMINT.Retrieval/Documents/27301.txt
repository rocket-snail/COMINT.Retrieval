dimensions and units by considering the expression for
    power in terms of the dimensions m l and t on the one hand and
    in terms of current and voltage on the other hand it follows
    that quantity of electricity may be regarded as having the
    dimensions l using this result all the other electrical
    magnitudes can be expressed in terms of m l and t with integral
    indices the separate question of the best system of units is
    discussed briefly the mks system fits well with the above
    dimensional system
