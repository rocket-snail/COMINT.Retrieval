distortion and power in aperiodic amplifiers using ideal
    screen grid valves calculations are made for class a ab b and c
    operation assuming a parabolic or nearly parabolic vl valve
    characteristic a determination is made of the input waveform
    required to give a pure sinusoidal output the effect of
    negative feedback is studied operation with sawtooth or square
    pulses is discussed
