a study of transistors connected in parallel the
    performance of the parallel combination of transistors is
    studied in terms of a single equivalent transistor whose
    parameters re related in a simple manner to those of the
    individual transistors expressions are derived for the gain and
    the input and output impedances for the three basic modes of
    operation results of experiments with both point contact and
    junction types are in good agreement with the theoretical
    results
