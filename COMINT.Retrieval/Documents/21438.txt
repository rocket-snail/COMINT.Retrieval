how to increase the efficiency of the readers' work in
    the library. an important task of the 5-year-plan is to save
    readers' expenditure of effort in using libraries. computerised
    catalogues show wide potential. readers' requests are
    transmitted to large libraries' bookstores along t.v.
    communication channels. document reproduction has significantly
    lessened readers' expenditure of effort. automation of
    acquisitioning, cataloguing, interlibrary loans, selective
    retrieval also save readers' time. large libraries have
    automated systems for issuing bibliographies, abstracts, union
    catalogues. large information-computer centres will be created
    for collective use as information transmission systems. the
    state automated scientific and technical information system
    should economise on librarians' and readers' time' the
    governing factors in library automation.
