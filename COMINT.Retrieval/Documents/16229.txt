the possible occurrence of negative nitrogen ions in the
    atmosphere if negative ions are formed and laboratory
    experiments show that they may be a strong pressure dependence
    of the electron ion recombination coefficient is to be expected
    at the very low f region pressures the rate of disappearance of
    free electrons could follow an attachment law
