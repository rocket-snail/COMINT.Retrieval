diffraction patterns at the plane of a slit in a
    reflecting screen measurements were made of the diffraction
    pattern in slits ranging in width from to microwave radiation
    of and was used ratios of intensity in the slit to intensity of
    the unperturbed beam were determined for plane polarized
    radiation incident on the conducting screen
