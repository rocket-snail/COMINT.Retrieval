evangelical library work in bavaria. contribution to an
    issue devoted to the german librarians conference at
    regensburg, 9-13 june 81. protestant public libraries in
    bavaria are run by the bavarian branch of the german
    association of evangelical libraries which participates in the
    state library development programme in return for some
    financial support. the libraries, open to all, have stocks
    comparable with small branch libraries; they are particularly
    valuable in underprivileged rural areas where they act as
    centres for communication and culture. staff are mainly
    voluntary workers for whom part-time training courses are
    arranged. the association publishes a quarterly information
    sheet for bavaria and a quarterly periodical covering the whole
    of germany. the bavarian branch maintains a central library of
    29,000 volumes to supplement small library stocks, organising
    block loans to them and to other interested bodies such as
    youth clubs and organisers of retirement courses.
