electronic switch doubles as cathode follower basic two
    way electronic switch may be expanded to multiway unit by
    adding input selector circuits or may be used as a precision
    cathode follower by eliminating the selector circuit has near
    infinite input impedance and near zero output impedance
    comparator compensation permits accuracy of over
