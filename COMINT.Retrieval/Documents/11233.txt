measurement of the refractive index of lucite by
    recoilless resonance absorption details are given of a method
    of modulating the frequency of a monochromatic em wave by
    varying the optical pathe length between the source and
    detector in the application described a small frequency shift
    in radiation is detected by recoilless resonance
    absorption
