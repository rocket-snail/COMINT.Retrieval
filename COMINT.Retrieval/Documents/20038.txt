patterns of journal use in a departmental library' a
    citation analysis. citation analysis of faculty publications,
    doctoral dissertations, and preliminary doctoral qualifying
    briefs produced by faculty and students of the biology
    department, temple university, is used to assess journal use in
    the biology library during the years 1975-77. there are 3,739
    citations to 336 journals in the combined sources ranking. the
    distribution of citations in each user group ranking and the
    combined sources ranking takes the form of a bradford
    distribution. 60 highly cited titles are examined in detail.
    dissertation citations are dependent on active faculty
    participation in the doctoral programme. citations in
    qualifying briefs cover a broader range of topics and interests
    than either of the other 2 sources. citation frequencies of
    volumes published in the periods 1960-69 and 1970-77 are
    examined. several collection maintenance and development
    decisions have been made, based on the results of this study.
    citation analysis is shown to be a useful tool in assessing
    actual and potential journal use by a heterogeneous clientele
    in a departmental library.
