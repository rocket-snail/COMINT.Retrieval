automodulation in ferroresonance automodulation of forced
    oscillations in ferroresonant circuits ie circuits containing
    nonlinear reactive elements is considered the following
    examples are examined circuit with a thermistor circuit with a
    capacitor whose value depends on the field and on temperature
    an es voltmeter connected to a ferroresonant circuit the
    stationary operating conditions and their stability in such
    circuits are discussed and the depth and period of
    automodulation are determined the discussion is limited to
    cases in which the circuit is nearly of the linear conservative
    type and the variations of amplitude and phase are slow in
    comparison with the period of the external force
