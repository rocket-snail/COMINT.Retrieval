a magslip isograph the terms of a polynomial equation to
    be solved are represented by alternating voltages of varying
    time phases obtained from magslip transmitters the instrument
    described is capable of solving sixth degree equations having
    real coefficients and may be used for the e valuation of
    polynomials
