an approximate method for obtaining transient response
    from frequency response a rapid method for finding the
    transient response of a linear system whose frequency response
    is known numerically but not as an analytical function involves
    use of a specially constructed transparent cursor the technique
    can also be used to deal with the inverse problem or to derive
    a analytical function representing the behaviour of a system of
    which either the frequency response or the transient response
    has been measured
