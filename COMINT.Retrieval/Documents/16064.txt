the calculation of carrier frequency transients by using
    function theory and the laplace transform method exact
    calculations are made without introducing any assumptions
    regarding the phase response of the transmission system
    demodulation calculations by two methods are considered as an
    example of use of the preferred method a calculation of the
    carrier frequency transients is made for the vestigial sideband
    if amplifier described by zimmermann of a step voltage is used
    for modulation in appendices the practical application of the
    residue theorem to transmission calculations is demonstrated
    and a chart for plotting transients is presented
