research in librarianship. the cyril and methodius
    national library is the national research centre in the field
    of librarianship and bibliography. research is carried out in
    close cooperation with the university library in sofia, as well
    as regional central libraries and some major libraries in the
    ussr. although the research projects planned for the 8th 5-year
    plan (1981-85) are strictly scientific they are not out of
    touch with reality. all types of the country's libraries and,
    indeed, the library network as a whole will benefit from the
    results. the issues under investigation include propaganda of
    literature, guided reading, open access in public libraries,
    audio-visual resources, new subject catalogues, library
    services in secondary schools, recommended bibliographies, and
    the relative importance of specialised book collections to
    particular types of library.
