apparatus for the experimental study of the diffraction
    of centimetre waves apparatus operating at is described for
    determining the phase and intensity at any point of the em
    field two versions are presented one for the investigation of
    diffraction near the axis and the other for the distant
    diffraction field the effect of diffracting bodies less than in
    size can be detected
