exhibitions in university libraries. new possibilities of
    cooperation within universities. university libraries and
    universities are faced with the problem of how to make academic
    university work clear and intelligible to the outsider. 1 way
    is through well-organised public exhibitions in university
    libraries. an exhibition which was organised by students of the
    history of art department at freiberg university in june/july
    80 was an excellent example of this type of activity. the
    students arranged contact with the media, the actual exhibition
    objects, contact with the artists, publicity, an opening at
    which the artists were present, guides to the exhibition,
    workshops, talks and public discussions. all the library had to
    do was provide the exhibition rooms. the exhibition was
    extremely successful and acted as a stimulus to other groups
    within the university to organise similar exhibitions to
    present their current work projects to the public.
