impossible behaviour of nonlinear networks the following
    proposition is discussed an isothermal electromechanical system
    whose primary resistors are quasi linear cannot convert direct
    current to alternating current a resistor is said to be quasi
    linear if the voltage drop across it is a function only of the
    current and if the differential resistance is positive
