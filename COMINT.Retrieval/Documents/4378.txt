study of atmospheric ions in a nonequilibrium system the
    variation with time of the concentration of small ions in the
    atmosphere in a nonequilibrium system has been determined
    theoretically and in two sets of experiments if the atmosphere
    is relatively unpolluted equilibrium conditions may not be
    restored after disturbance until a time of about minutes has
    elapsed
