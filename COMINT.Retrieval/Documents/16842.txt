library service to a community. discusses and suggests
    ways of catering for the reading needs of people in the
    author's birthplace of tokaino village, buin, north solomons
    province, papua new guinea. its population is 200, mostly
    children and young adults, and most children attend the 3 local
    community schools. there is no library service at present in
    the buin area, but the buin provincial high school library
    serves both as a school and public library. a proper public
    library should be built in the town centre, run independently
    of the school library, and community information centres or
    mobile services should operate in each area, the former staffed
    by a librarian and a teacher. school dropouts (the area has
    many) could communicate effectively with the people about the
    importance of library use, with a view to possible library
    training for those who work successfully.
