nature of ball lightning energy considerations indicate
    that ball lightning can be sustained neither by a chemical
    process nor by a nuclear process it is suggested that the
    luminous ball could be produced in a weakly ionized gas by a
    resonance process the energy required to increase the
    ionization and then to maintain it inside a sphere of diameter
    d being supplied by rf waves with d the centre of the sphere
    would coincide with a maximum of the wave interference field
    the rf waves could be due to an oscillatory process in the
    ionized atmosphere excited by a lightning discharge the
    proposed mechanism also explains bead lightning the absence of
    influence of wind on the position of the luminous ball and the
    waveguide effect of chimneys explosive and quiet types of decay
    are associated respectively with rapid and slow changes in the
    rf field strength at the end of the phenomenon observations in
    the decimetre region during thunderstorms and experiments on
    the artificial production of ball lightning are
    suggested
