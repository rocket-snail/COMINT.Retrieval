library use as a leisure activity. introductory speech to
    the study session of the working party for county library
    systems, noordwijkerhout, 1 sept 81. in the netherlands, the
    rise in living standards since world war ii has outstripped the
    increase in leisure time. in addition the average citizen
    devotes a large proportion of his increased purchasing power to
    acquiring private comforts. whereas before the war most people
    visited the cinema or theatre for entertainment, and travelled
    by bus or train, nowadays they watch television at home and
    travel by private car. similarly research shows that the
    average citizen uses the library not as a substitute for a
    private collection of books but to supplement his own
    collection. as the economic recession deepens there is a real
    danger that the government will turn public libraries into
    recreational centres and create new libraries as information
    centres.
