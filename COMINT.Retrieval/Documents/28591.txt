a general circle diagram for the input admittance of a
    grounded grid disk seal triode the method given takes account
    of the transconductance and anode cathode capacitance of the
    triode the effect of the transconductance phase which depends
    on the electron transit time is shown in the diagram a
    numerical example is given see also of november
