high frequency gas discharge plasma in hydrogen the
    microwave field strength required to maintain a hydrogen plasma
    in the steady state is calculated from theory based on a
    solution of the boltzmann transport equation the results are in
    satisfactory agreement with measurements made in a resonant
    cavity at different values of pressure and plasma
    concentration
