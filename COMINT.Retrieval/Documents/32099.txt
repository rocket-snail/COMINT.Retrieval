method of calculating electromagnetic fields excited by
    an alternating current in stratified media the expressions for
    the field due to a dipole in the boundary of a stratified half
    space are developed in a form suitable for evaluation by a
    modern computer the characteristics of the strata are assumed
    to be independent of time and of the field the permeability is
    constant and the conductivities are arbitrary the conductivity
    of the surface layer is finite
