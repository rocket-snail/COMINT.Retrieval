the design of quadripoles in the case of symmetrical
    quadripoles by writing where and are the impedance parameters
    defined earlier of general expressions are derived by a matrix
    treatment for the current and voltage in a ladder network in
    which the characteristic impedance term z occurs in the first
    degree
