world wide measurements of horizontal ionospheric drifts
    a critical survey is made of radio techniques for measuring
    horizontal drifts a comparison is then made of results obtained
    during the i g y using the closely spaced receiver method which
    discloses seasonal and latitudinal differences in the diurnal
    variation of drifts tentative explanations of these results are
    given
