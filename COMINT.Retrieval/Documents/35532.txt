new active circuit element using the magneto resistive
    effect a basic circuit is considered comprising a bridge with
    resistance arms lying in toil in the bridge diagonal analysis
    indicate that bistable operation is possible with reasonably
    short resolving time it may be necessary to operate at low
    temperature a design is described using layers in gaps of
    shaped electromagnets tristable operation is possible but not
    practical
