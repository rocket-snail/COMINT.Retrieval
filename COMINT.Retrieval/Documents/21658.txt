this is why the danish library association is
    participating in the teledata experiment. explains the
    involvement of the danish library association (danmarks
    biblioteksforening (db)) in the danish teleadministration's
    planned teledata experiment, due to run for 2 years from jan
    82. 200 tv sets will be placed with selected users, 25 of whom
    will be public institutions and 10 of these libraries. about 60
    organisations will provide information and db will coordinate
    the information supplied to the teledata base. db was able to
    argue successfully against fees for the use of the teledata
    during the experimental period. by being involved in the
    development of information technology from the start, db is
    better able to influence it. this also explains why db is a
    member of danmedia, has helped to set up a technology committee
    and is represented in the media commission. a project aimed at
    evaluation of the teledata medium from a library viewpoint is
    being developed by the library inspectorate and d b. includes a
    bibliography of articles on information technology published in
    2bogens verden1 since 1979.
