a broad band cyclotron resonance r f detector tube
    operation is based on the cyclotron resonance of an electron
    beam in a static magnetic and r f electric field in the pencil
    beam tube described spiralling electrons are detected by a
    honeycomb mesh grid the current intercepted by the grid is
    greatest at resonance and is proportional to the r f signal
    power mechanical details and operating conditions are given a
    simplified energy transfer analysis enables the electrical
    characteristics to be predicted
