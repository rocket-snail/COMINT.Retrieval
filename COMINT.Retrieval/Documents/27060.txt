ionospheric wind analysis by meteoric echo techniques the
    procedure for finding vector average wind of is shown to be
    unaffected by the presence of turbulent wind components
    expressions are derived for the rms values of the horizontal
    and vertical wind components sources of errors are discussed in
    detail
