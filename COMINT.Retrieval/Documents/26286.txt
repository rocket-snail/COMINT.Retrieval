vertex generated waves outside metallic wedges the waves
    generated by a magnetic line source placed at the vertex of a
    wedge of high conductivity and arbitrary angle are studied the
    effect of a dielectric coating on the wedge is examined and the
    propagation of surface waves considered briefly
