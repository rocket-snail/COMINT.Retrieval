magnetic switching circuits magnetic circuits to produce
    the logical operations of and and or are described which may be
    combined to produce any switching function of any number of
    input binary variables the only components used are magnetic
    cores wire and resistors there is no extremely sensitive
    parameter in these circuits which must be adjusted carefully in
    order to ensure proper operation
