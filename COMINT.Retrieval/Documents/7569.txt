plasma diffusion in a magnetic field the equations
    governing the diffusion of a fully ionized plasma across a
    magnetic field are derived it is assumed that macroscopic
    quantities vary slowly across an ion radius of gyration and
    that the interparticle collision frequency is much less than
    the gyration frequency the relevant transport coefficients
    electrical resistivity thermal conductivity and thermoelectric
    coefficient are derived some similarity solutions of the
    equations are found
