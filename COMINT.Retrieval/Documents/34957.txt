the library of the liepzig institute of technology.
    structure, development and present situation. the leipzig
    institute of technology was founded in 1977-80. before then
    several smaller institutes and colleges of engineering and
    related subjects existed, all with some kind of library. these
    libraries were integrated to form the new leipzig institute of
    technology library. the institute has a decentralised structure
    and the library was organised on the same lines. there is a
    main library with 5 department libraries, concentrating
    particularly on building collections for polygraphy and civil
    engineering, besides being responsible for collections of all
    the related subjects. the library provides support in training
    and research for students and staff of the institute and a rise
    in library users has been achieved. international relationships
    have been expanded, especially with similar institutes in the
    ussr. among the projects planned for 1981 are the formation of
    a selective bibliography for civil engineering and collecting
    and cataloguing research and development, travel and conference
    reports.
