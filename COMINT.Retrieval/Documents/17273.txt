magnetic double refraction of microwaves in paramagnetics
    investigation at of the rotation of the plane of polarization
    of an wave in a circular waveguide containing a paramagnetic
    salt and its dependence on the intensity of the static magnetic
    field perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation
