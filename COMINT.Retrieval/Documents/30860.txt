    linguistic aspects of thesauri; formal requirements suggested

    associated with compound terms, homographs, forms of terms,
    etc.; semantic relationships between terms-synonymy, bt/nt, and
    associativity; problems peculiar to multilingual thesauri,
    especially the problem of inexact equivalence between terms;
