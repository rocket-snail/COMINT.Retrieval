why engineers don't use databases. shortened version of
    an article in 2mechanical engineering1 mar 81. claims that us
    engineers largely ignore computerised data banks and use dated
    and limited information sources. they collect most of their
    advanced technical information through discussions with
    vendors, salesmen, consultants, and their peers and restrict
    their formal reading to the material in the vicinity of their
    desks. the culprit is the indexing' the major indexing systems
    index by subject or the name of an object, but an engineer
    wishes to retrieve information indexed by function. also, vital
    product information is not available on a creditable data
    base.
