impedance transformation of linear terminal networks if
    outlets of a terminal network are terminated by variable
    reactances the resulting quadripole represents a variable
    transformer as the value of these reactances varies between the
    input impedance assumes all values of the transforming range
    this range does not include the entire right hand half of the
    complex impedance plane but only circular areas thereof an
    equation is derived for determining these circles the method is
    demonstrated in relation to a waveguide hybrid t
