school libraries in lower saxony. lecture given to the
    conference of librarians in lower saxony, celle, apr 81. since
    1979 the school library centre in hanover has provided
    centralised purchasing, processing and advisory services for
    the school libraries in its area. the question as to whether
    school libraries should be run by librarians or teachers is
    still disputed. school libraries are particularly important in'
    the reformed grammar school, where they promote independent
    study and cooperation between teachers and pupils; schools open
    all day, where the library becomes a communication centre
    catering for leisure as well as academic activity; vocational
    training schools, where they cater for students from all levels
    of secondary education, provide special help for foreign
    students with language problems and develop possibilities for
    job flexibility. clear, preferably binding, regulations on
    cooperation between school and public libraries are
    needed.
