an approximate theory of the diffraction of an
    electromagnetic wave by an aperture in a plane screen theory
    based on the sommerfeld half plane solution is developed for
    certain regions the field can be conceived as arising from the
    flow of electric and magnetic currents along the edge of the
    half plane this concept is extended to apertures of arbitrary
    form the case of the circular aperture being studied
    particularly the theory is supported by results of
    measurements
