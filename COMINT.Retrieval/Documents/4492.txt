cowocor' the +c+omputer +w+ord +coding and +research
    documentation system of the hoechst company. cowocor has been
    developed since 1968 to rationalise documentation of chemical
    literature and improve its technical and economic content.
    information and documentation are carried out in 1 process by
    means of modern text processing machinery. the process is
    described in detail; abstracts are recorded on magnetic tapes,
    whose texts are used as printer's copy for a fortnightly
    abstracting journal. 150,000 abstracts are stored at present.
    the tapes are the basis of input, coding and retrieval. the
    cowocor thesaurus contains 75,000 terms including synonyms. the
    classification is basically monohierarchic with additional
    polydimensions; the treatment of synonyms, composite terms and
    homographs is discussed.
