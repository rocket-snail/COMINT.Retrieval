information education of pupils and the role of the
    teacher. the 'information education' of school children is not
    just the responsibility of librarians, but it should be an
    integral part of the modern teaching process in every subject.
    school libraries have traditionally operated on a rudimentary
    level as bookstocks with lending outlets-mostly supplying
    literature relevant to the teaching of the mother tongue. this
    is no longer adequate and school libraries must be transformed
    into up-to-date information and study centres. the slovak
    ministry of education has issued a directive no 3767/1979 which
    envisages school libraries fulfilling 3 roles' supplying
    library and information material to both teachers and pupils;
    contributing to the upbringing of the new socialist generation
    through working with books; educating both teachers and pupils
    to use information sources independently during individual
    study, career selection and leisure. acquisition must place
    greater emphasis on scientific, te chnical and other subject
    oriented books.
