a method of evaluating the intensity of radio signals
    reflected from the surface of the moon propagation losses can
    be determined by supposing that the reflected wave is formed
    within the limits of the first fresnel half zone and taking
    account of the curvature of the reflecting surface the method
    provides a more accurate picture of the reflection
    phenomena
