interlibrary lending in the netherlands. interlending in
    the netherlands is based on a national system for the supply of
    scholarly literature and a regional system for supplying a
    wider range of material mainly between public libraries.
    725,000 requests were made in 1979. most requests are satisfied
    through union catalogues or printed union lists. in addition to
    the 12 provincial centres, the 13 regional support libraries
    have a central role in the regional supply system; they
    received 131,708 requests in 1980 and satisfied 27%. a single
    centre in each region is recommended. a survey of the national
    system showed that 40% of all requests at this level came from
    academic libraries, 40% from special libraries and 20% from
    public libraries. most requests are for science and technology
    (60%), for english language material (55% of all requests; 70%
    of requests for journals), and for more recent material (65%
    published in the last 10 years). the satisfaction rate was 76%
    (higher for req uests sent to union catalogues): 1/2 were
    supplied in 2 weeks, 2/3 in 3 weeks important gaps in journal
    coverage were identified. an on-line national union catalogue
    will be available in 1984 and will be used to distribute
    requests more evenly between libraries, but specific grants to
    support the interlending function in major supplying libraries
    will still be necessary, and charges should be made. improved
    union catalogues are envisaged at the regional level
    also.
