libraries' role in information on developing countries.
    when the united nations was established in 1945, serious
    efforts 1st began to disseminate information on developing
    countries. the united nations has over 300 depot libraries, 14
    of them in scandinavia. international development agencies
    exist in all 5 scandinavian countries. in some countries
    information is available from these agencies, but in others
    only from non-government organisations. special libraries exist
    in several scandinavian institutions, research being
    particularly concentrated on africa, asia and latin america.
    several countries have specialised research institutes.
    supplementary information must be sought in large general
    public and special libraries, and from local humanitarian,
    political and religious organisations. a pan-scandinavian
    bibliography of relevant data bases would be valuable.
    librarians recognise a need for better organised documentation;
    library associations in denmark, norway and sweden have
    establish ed committees of developing countries. scandinavian
    national and regional committees on these lines are desirable
    to coordinate accessions and establish area and subject
    specialisation plans.
