auroral echoes observed north of the auroral zone on at a
    site north of the accepted auroral zone maximum radar echoes on
    a frequency of were readily obtained from the north but
    practically none from the south the range of the reflecting
    points was from to these results are in agreement with the
    theory of reflection by aurorae suggested by and developed by
    requiring near perpendicularity of radio ray paths to the lines
    of the earths magnetic field on transmitting towards the south
    across visible aurorae on propagation associated with aurora
    was almost nonexistent as required by the theory
