effective magnetic anisotropy and magnetostriction of
    monocrystals a nine constant expression is derived which
    describes empirically the spontaneous magnetostriction to the
    sixth order in the direction cosines of the magnetization the
    relation between the effective anisotropy in domains and domain
    walls is also studied
