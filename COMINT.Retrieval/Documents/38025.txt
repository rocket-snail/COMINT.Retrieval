a derivation method for designing two and three element
    filter structures a summary of fundamental principles with
    specific examples of two and three element design using loss
    free elements with no mutual inductance the h n and associative
    derivations and an extension of zobels m derivation are treated
    also the lc derivation involving interchange of la and c
    application of nortons transformation is illustrated
