readers and their reading trends in the british council
    library, delhi. to find out the reading trends of the readers
    of the british council library, delhi, a survey was conducted
    taking the books borrowed during 28 jan-9 feb 80 on mondays,
    wednesdays, fridays and saturdays as a sample. results of the
    survey have been presented with tables and charts. the survey
    indicates that the library is functioning effectively, and the
    students are the largest single group of users. however, there
    is strong discontent among all categories of borrowers about
    the modern fiction collection. it has been concluded that the
    survey will be most helpful in the future book selection policy
    of the library.
