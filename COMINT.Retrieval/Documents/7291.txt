magnetic core circuits for digital data processing
    systems circuits for interconnecting toroidal cores used to
    perform various functions in digital computers are discussed a
    single diode loop permits unconditional transfer of information
    from one or more transmitting cores to one or more receiving
    cores a split winding loop permits conditional transfer and
    hence logical operations an inhibit loop is also described the
    operation of shift registers cycle distributors counters etc is
    explained
