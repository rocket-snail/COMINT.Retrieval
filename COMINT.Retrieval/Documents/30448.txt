brazilian libraries as seen by librarians and users.
    answers obtained to a questionnaire circulated to prominent
    brazilian intellectuals and librarians as a preliminary to a
    survey of all brazilian librarians and users. 4 users,
    comprising a professor, 2 writers, and a teacher, each discuss
    the significance of libraries in the development of brazilian
    culture and the training of intellectuals; 11 librarians from
    universities, public libraries, research institutes and library
    science schools, discuss the factors impeding the development
    of libraries and preventing public access.
