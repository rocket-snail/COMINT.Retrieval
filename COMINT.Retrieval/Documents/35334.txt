the initiation of a vhf pulse discharge in neon an
    investigation carried out at with pulses of duration sec is
    described the distribution function of the electron velocities
    the kinetic coefficient of the electron interaction with the
    gas molecules the hf conductivity and the onset of discharge
    induced by a rectangular hf pulse are examined the results are
    presented graphically
