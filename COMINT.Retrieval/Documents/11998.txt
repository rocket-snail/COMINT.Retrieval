the behaviour of polystyrene capacitors under alternating
    voltage experiments at are reported the main conclusions
    reached are heat treatment has no adverse effect on life for a
    given value of applied voltage the life is shortened if the
    voltage gradient is increased for a given ratio between applied
    voltage and initial ionization voltage the life is considerably
    shortened if ambient temperature is raised certain
    considerations regarding the impregnation of capacitors with
    mineral oil are discussed
