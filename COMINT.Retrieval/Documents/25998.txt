frequency multiplication by large factors by means of the
    oscillation build up method frequency multiplication by factors
    of several thousands can be achieved with the oscillator
    described which is pulse controlled at the fundamental
    frequency and produces a harmonic spectrum of few components
    during the build up of oscillations
