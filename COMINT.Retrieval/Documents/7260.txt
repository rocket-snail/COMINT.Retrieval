the effects of energetic trapped particles on
    magnetospheric motions and ionospheric currents distortions of
    stable belts of particles in the earths magnetic field due for
    example to the interaction of new groups of particles or to the
    compression of the earths fields by a neutral stream could
    result in a system of ionospheric currents and magnetospheric
    motions of the form assumed by axford and hines
