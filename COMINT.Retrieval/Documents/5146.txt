the librarians' union and future education for
    librarianship. a group of students at the danish library school
    criticises the librarians' union for lack of policy on
    education for librarianship, which is the subject of a
    committee of the ministry of culture, and urges it to initiate
    a debate among the members. the group presents its own
    suggestions' minor subjects should be gathered in larger
    subject groups; account should be taken in teaching of the
    trend to libraries staffed by a single librarian; the use of
    computers should not be a subject on its own, but taught in
    connection with all subject areas; teaching of russian could be
    confined to teaching of transliteration under cataloguing; the
    teaching of literature and information retrieval should give a
    theoretical basis for searching within any subject area and not
    aim to give thorough knowledge of particular subjects; and the
    new unified course should not include specialisation, but
    emphasise the common aspects of education for librari
    anship.
