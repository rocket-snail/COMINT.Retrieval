the development of library services in tanzania.
    following independence in 1961 the government of the former
    british colony of tanzania has placed a high priority on the
    provision of education for all levels of the population. as
    part of this educational programme funds have been allocated in
    the national budget for the development of library services. in
    1963 the government founded the tanganyika library services
    board which was replaced in 1975 by the tanzania library
    services board. the board's functions include the supervision
    of public library services, the training of librarians and the
    publication of the tanzania national bibliography. however,
    because of the lack of adequate financial resources and of
    trained librarians the board has been unable to achieve its
    objectives of providing at least 1 public library in each
    region of the country.
