bootstrap circuit technique the normal amplifier the
    cathode follower and the anode follower are shown to comprise a
    set of four circuits related to one another by simple circuit
    transformations three methods of excitation are distinguished
    each circuit may be put into feedback form and the four basic
    feedback configurations applicable to bootstrap amplifiers are
    given a number of practical examples are described
