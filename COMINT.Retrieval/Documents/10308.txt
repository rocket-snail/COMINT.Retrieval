establishing a basis for mapping natural-language
    statements onto a database query language. describes a project
    on informal (natural)/formal (data base query) language
    mapping. a basis was developed for processing english-language
    requests for information retrieval from an existing dbms (data
    base management system). the role of each word in the
    natural-language query was identified by 2 separate methods-a
    learning algorithm and a statistical technique. the programme
    was run with a set of 400 sentences from a basic science book.
    the results, which were judged to be encouraging, are
    discussed.
