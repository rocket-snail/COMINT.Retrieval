modified exponential line as improved transforming
    element with high pass characteristic for a given length of
    exponential line there is a critical frequency above which the
    transformation property becomes effective at frequencies only a
    little above critical the transformation is only approximate
    this drawback can be avoided by designing the line so that the
    characteristic impedance does not vary exactly exponentially
    approximate line equations are derived for this case and
    practical forms of such lines are discussed the influence of
    constructional defects is examined
