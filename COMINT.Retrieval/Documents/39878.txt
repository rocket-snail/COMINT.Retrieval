bifilar t trap details are given of a circuit with a
    bifilar t trap designed for rejecting the second harmonic of a
    signal in an infrared detector amplifier other applications of
    the bifilar t trap are considered eg a tuned af amplifier
    having a bandwidth of a few hundred cycles with a narrow band
    of high attenuation at the centre and a narrow band feedback
    amplifier
