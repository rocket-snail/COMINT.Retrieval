the written press in 1981. a paper prepared for the 1981
    association des bibliothecaires francais (abf) conference
    discussing future prospects for the press in relation to the
    challenge of other media. surveys the history of the press in
    general since the invention of printing, and shows that today
    the public prefers press reportage of important events to radio
    and television coverage. since the war, technological
    developments have increased the efficiency of the press as well
    as promoting rival media. despite social changes and improved
    living standards, radio and television have not replaced the
    press, but rather supplement it. the effects of local radio and
    national information networks remain to be seen, but unlike
    radio and television, the press is not state controlled. the
    public has always looked to the press for comment and news in
    eventful times, and will probably continue to do so.
