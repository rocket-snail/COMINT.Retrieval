some effects of diamagnetic ring currents on van allen
    radiation a qualitative theoretical model is proposed to
    explain the depletion of the outer van allen belt during the
    main phase of a storm the theory incorporates a magnetic tail
    on the dark side of earth a ring current centred at earth radii
    and local betatron acceleration and deceleration of van allen
    and solar pz particles
