    critical field antiferromagnetic materials nuclear magnetism
    and nuclear relaxation line breadths and the theory of
    magnetism the influence of electrons on nuclear spin resonance
    in diamagnetic materials chemical displacement and indirect
    interaction stochastic theory of magnetic resonance the concept
    of temperature in magnetism magnetism at very low temperatures
