vector representation in the time plane of electrical
    potential difference current and power varying sinusoidally in
    time the varying magnitudes are considered according to a
    method originally used by fresnel as the resultant of two
    imaginary vectors of equal and constant length rotating at the
    same rate in opposite senses the imaginary plane containing
    these vectors is called the time plane the impedances of a
    circuit to the two vector components of a sinusoidally varying
    current are defined and the method of representing power ie the
    product of voltage and current is explained
