information processing today and tomorrow. as a 1st step
    in determining uk local authority information-processing
    equipment needs, the local government operational research unit
    compiled a directory of the main data holdings in berkshire
    local authorities and monitored its use by local officers. the
    directory was little-used; when officers required data, they
    asked personal contacts. this indicates that the value of
    providing extensive search and retrieval facilities in local
    authorities should be questioned. the introduction of
    electronic record-keeping may be the most effective way to use
    the new technology.
