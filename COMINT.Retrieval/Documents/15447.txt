the correction of observational data for instrumental
    bandwidth the formula relating t readings instrument having t
    apparatus function to th true values of an observed function is
    stated a three point interpolation operator can be chosen to
    simulate the spreading action of a class of functions under
    certain conditions the interpolation operator has an exact
    inverse which when applied to gives a function which is a
    better approximation to the accuracy obtained is discussed
    effect of the method on the standard errors in the measurement
    is found
