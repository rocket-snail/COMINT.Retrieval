the ethics of further education librarianship. the
    librarian's 'clients' in the further education sector are
    identified. his duties towards them and the problems raised by
    them are discussed, with special reference to the education of
    the 16-19 age group. the need for the librarian to hold their
    diverse and sometimes conflicting demands in balance is seen as
    an aspect of his duties that requires professional autonomy for
    its satisfactory performance. the need for a balanced use of
    the facilities, coverage of subject areas, provision for
    divergent views, and encouragement of free enquiry leads to the
    suggestion that treatment rather than ideas is what the
    librarian is best qualified to assess. pornography is discussed
    in relation to this and other criteria. the growth of open
    learning is seen as demanding a positive tutorial approach. the
    need for moral courage is affirmed.
