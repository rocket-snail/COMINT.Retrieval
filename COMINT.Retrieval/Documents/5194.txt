proposal for legal amendment to the belgian law of 22
    march 1886 with reference to reprography. 2 separate proposals
    laid before (1) the belgian senate in mar 81, and (2) the
    belgian chamber of representatives in oct 80 respectively. each
    begins with a preliminary discussion showing how technical
    developments have rendered modification of the original law
    necessary, invoking the berne convention as a guiding
    principle. the proposals then set out in detail largely similar
    suggestions for insertion of amendments, with comprehensive
    comment on and justification of the points covered, which
    include the necessity for authors' permission, limit on maximum
    number of copies, obligations of owners of reprographic
    equipment, and arrangements for financial compensation.
