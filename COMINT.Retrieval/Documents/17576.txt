new circuits for generating pulses by means of a pulsed
    reactor review of circuits containing a saturable reactor with
    rectangular magnetization characteristic for deriving pulses of
    required amplitude and phase from a sine wave input the method
    of shifting the phase by means of an auxiliary pre magnetizing
    current is described pulse shapes obtainable from a square wave
    input are discussed and practical circuits for deriving this
    input from single and three phase ac are shown
