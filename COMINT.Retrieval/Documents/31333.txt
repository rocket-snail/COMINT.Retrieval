noise in maser amplifiers theory and experiment the
    theoretical treatment is based on an equivalent microwave
    circuit the effective input noise temperature of a reflection
    type beam maser was found experimentally to be which is in
    agreement with theory an upper limit of for the beam
    temperature was deduced
