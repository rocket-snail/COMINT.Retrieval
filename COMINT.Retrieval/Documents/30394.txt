trends in industrial information resource centers.
    information is an essential part of any corporation's
    resources. only recently, however, has emphasis been placed on
    the integration of various kinds of information services
    offered in the corporate environment. a trend has emerged to
    view the variety of information processing technologies from a
    general systems perspective, termed 'information resource
    management' (irm). a major concern of top management is to
    educate users in information as a corporate resource.
