travelling wave tube system having m ultiplied gain
    advantage is taken of the wide frequency band of travelling
    wave valves to obtain increases gain by heterodyning the output
    to a different frequency and then feeding it to the valve again
    the system is useful in microwave relay stations where it is in
    any case necessary to change the carrier frequency to prevent
    feedback from the transmitting aerial to the receiving
    aerial
