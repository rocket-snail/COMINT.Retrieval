the structure of the layer as deduced from its daily
    variations observed variations in the region may be accounted
    for by assuming that in consequence of the decrease with height
    of the effective decay coefficient the maximum electron density
    in the region is at a level above that of maximum electron
    production and that vertical semidiurnal tidal drift is
    nonuniform at the level of maximum electron production the rate
    of production varies inversely as temperature an attachment
