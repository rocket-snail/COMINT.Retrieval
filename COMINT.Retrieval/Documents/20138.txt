the national librarians association and association
    credibility. contribution to a special feature on the future of
    associations. nla was founded in 1975 to meet a long-felt need
    in many librarians for a national professional association
    which would concern itself exclusively with librarian issues
    rather than with the entire gamut of issues related to
    libraries in society. nla is small, new and not well
    understood. the usa has 100,000 librarians, but nla has only
    500 members. no library publication has reported on or
    evaluated nla's position papers on a nationwide system of
    certification for librarians and on professional welfare.
    library schools tend to ignore nla's offers to provide speakers
    or information materials. in many ways nla has achieved a great
    deal, but it stands at a critical point in its development. it
    may be that directly addressing 'bread and butter' issues will
    provide the impetus nla needs to regain its movement toward
    becoming a major national association for libraria ns.
