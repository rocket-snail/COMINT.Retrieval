some remarks on the interaction of solar plasma and the
    geomagnetic field an explanation of the small scale of magnetic
    disturbances on the earths surface is that currents flow in
    plasma sheets and move along the curved magnetic lines of force
    these sheets are distant less than one earths radius from the
    surface and would produce perturbation fields consistent with
    the size and direction necessary to explain storm time
    geomagnetic variations
