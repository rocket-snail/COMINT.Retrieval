the dielectric properties of water in solutions
    measurements have been made of the microwave dielectric
    constants and losses of water and some aqueous solutions over
    the temperature range using methods described by collie et al
    the dielectric constant of water at cm rises from at to at
    results for the solutions are tabulated and their
    interpretation is discussed
