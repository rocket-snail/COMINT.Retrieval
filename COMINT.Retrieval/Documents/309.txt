equipartition of energy and local isotropy in turbulent
    flows homogeneous turbulence was produced experimentally and
    experiments showed that the turbulence became isotropic at a
    faster rate than equipartition of energy occurred other
    experiments where approximately isotropic turbulence was
    subjected to deformation indicated that even at high reynolds
    number the deformation in a shear flow can cause anisotropy the
    connection of the investigation with turbulent flows in general
    is discussed
