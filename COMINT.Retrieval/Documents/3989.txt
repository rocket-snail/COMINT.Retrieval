distribution of conductivity within dielectric films on
    aluminium frequency and formation voltage characteristics were
    determined for a ac capacitor with an anodized al anode al
    cathodes nd electrolyte consisting of boric acid and bor tes in
    the range an equivalent circuit is given and a model is
    suggested consisting of a layer dielectric film one layer
    adjacent to the metal surface having low conductivity low power
    loss independent of frequency but dependent on the pe k
    formation voltage the other film with opposite
    properties
