public library bookstocks: new standards or no
    standards?. considers the variable factors affecting standards
    for public libraries, and discusses the attempts made by the
    bourdillon report in 1962, and the latest ifla standards for
    public libraries, to formulate standards for bookstock. argues
    that, in order to maintain a good standard of public library
    service in the uk, there should be a new and high level enquiry
    into how much of the greatly increased output of british
    publishing should be purchased today. points out that what
    needs to be known is whether public library bookfunds are now
    cut to the point where the quantity of new books being added is
    not matching those withdrawn through wear and tear, and that
    ideally there should be an excess of additions.
