f region triple splitting measurements of the direction
    of arrival of z echoes have been made at hobart tasmania the
    results indicate that f region triple splitting is caused by
    back scattering from a rough layer the directions observed are
    consistent with the assumption tht reflection at the z level
    occurs when the angle of incidence is such that the wave normal
    becomes parallel to the geomagnetic field at the ordinary level
    of reflection
