a theory of radar reflection from the moon and planets
    relations between the surface statistics of an irregular radar
    target and the angular power spectrum and autocorrelation
    function of the reflected signal are derived the spatial
    correlation function is also computed the theory is used to
    investigate the small scale structure of the moons
    surface
