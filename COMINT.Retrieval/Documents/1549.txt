subminiature transformers and transductors limitations
    associated with subminiature design are discussed in relation
    to audio and control frequency transformers and transductors
    below a certain size a toroidal shell construction has given
    results comparing favourably with laminated assemblies the
    signal power level of the transformers is sufficient for
    junction transistor circuits when this construction is applied
    to transductors the excitation and control field are
    orthogonally related a paper covering much of the same ground
