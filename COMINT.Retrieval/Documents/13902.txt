rectifier modulators a method for reducing the complexity
    of equations for the series rectifier modulator without undue
    loss of accuracy is postulated the simplified equations are
    shown to be soluble by successive approximations the process is
    applied to a modulator with a constant resistance termination b
    purely capacitive termination
