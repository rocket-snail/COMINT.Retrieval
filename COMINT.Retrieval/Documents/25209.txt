the three level solid state travelling wave maser
    theoretical comparison is made between the characteristics of
    the travelling wave maser and those of the cavity maser and the
    general requirements for slow wave structures are discussed
    theoretical analysis and experimental results are presented for
    the comb in waveguide slow wave structure
