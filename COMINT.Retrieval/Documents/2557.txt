library education and the need for coordination (in
    arabic). the jordan library association has supplied jordanian
    libraries with trained staff since its librarianship courses
    began in 1964, and the library and information centre was later
    established to take the responsibility in this field. suggests
    that library education is hampered by excessive interest in
    financial concerns and lack of proper planning. contends that'
    academic qualifications and field experience of instructors
    should be standardised; institutions qualified to teach
    librarianship must be defined; the real library needs of the
    country should be considered; quality must not be sacrificed to
    output of graduates; and coordination between individual
    institutions and the jla would be advantageous.
