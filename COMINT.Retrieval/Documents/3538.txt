surface currents induced by short wavelength radiation
    the integral equation given by fock of for the surface currents
    induced in a perfectly conducting convex object by short wave
    length plane electromagnetic waves is solved directly by the
    method of fourier transforms the result agrees with focks
    indirect approach some general properties of the equation are
    also discussed
