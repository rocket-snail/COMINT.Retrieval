dynamics of transistor negative resistance circuits a
    general method is presented for calculating approximately the
    characteristics of nonlinear circuits the region of operation
    is divided into subregions within each of which the circuit may
    be considered as nearly linear the method is applied to
    analysis of a high speed switching circuit using a point
