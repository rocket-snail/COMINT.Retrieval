    argues that developing networks for public libraries in the usa
    is not the answer to problems of limited financial resources.

    obtained from elsewhere and the 1st thing to be cut as funding
    falls is resource sharing activities. presents statistics for
    interloans in california and illinois to show what a minute %
    of circulation is accounted for by interloans. relying heavily
    on materials not available at once in a library is akin to a
    return to closed stacks. suggests the development of an
    equivalent to the british library lending division.
