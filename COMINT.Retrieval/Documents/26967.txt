a procedure for developing a typology of adult users of
    the public library. reports the identification and description
    of 2 different styles of public library use. adults who
    practice these styles appear to differ in their personal
    characteristics and behaviours, in the library services which
    they use, and in their evaluations of the library. a
    description of a typology of users based upon these styles has
    application in library user studies.
