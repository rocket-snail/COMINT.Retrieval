negative inductance cuts magnetic amplifier lag the speed
    of response of a magnetic amplifier is improved without
    reducing its sensitivity by balancing out the effect of control
    circuit inductance by means of a negative inductance device
    comprising a valve with an iron cored mutual inductor
