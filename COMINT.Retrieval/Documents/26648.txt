large amplitude hydromagnetic waves above the ionosphere
    arguments are presented for the existence of waves of amplitude
    about times that of geomagnetic fluctuations at the earths
    surface it is assumed that the latter are generated at six to
    ten earth radii and carried to earth by the waves it is
    suggested that the waves produce irregularities in electron
    density which cause radio star scintillation and that they are
    also responsible for high intensity particle radiation above
    about km
