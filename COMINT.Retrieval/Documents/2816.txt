thomas bennet and the origins of analytical bibliography.
    paper presented at library history seminar vi 'libraries &
    culture', austin, texas, 19-22 mar 80. a recent work asserts
    that a study by an 18th century scholar, thomas bennet, ranks
    well with current bibliographical studies. the work, on the
    thirty-nine articles of religion, was published in 1715, and
    consisted of 18 copies of the articles, 5 in latin and 13 in
    english. bennet reproduced exactly the text of one master copy
    in each language, and then recorded, in footnotes on the same
    page, every variation to be found in every other copy. details
    of evidence were then analysed, and conclusions drawn. a brief
    biography of bennet, and further details of his work are
    given.
