theory of the plasma in a rarefied gas when the current
    strength varies general equations for relatively slow processes
    in a plasma are applied to the calculation of the concentration
    of electrons and ions when the strength of the current through
    the gas varies the partial de ionization of the gas when the
    current decreases and the residual concentration of electrons
    and ions after the current ceases to flow are determined
