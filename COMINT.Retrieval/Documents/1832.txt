the optimum design of a tunable multiplier for frequency
    modulated oscillations the design of tunable frequency
    multipliers containing simple one or two stage filters in the
    individual multiplier stages is investigated adjacent channel
    attenuation and distortion can be achieved if the
    multiplication per stage does not exceed the fundamental
    frequency should not be less than about
