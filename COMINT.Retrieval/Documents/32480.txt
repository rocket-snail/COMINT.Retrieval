collections of patent documentation and the way soviet
    specialists need them. the soviet patent documentation system
    comprises collections at 4 levels' the very comprehensive
    collections of the all-union patent-technical library (vptb);
    industry branch oriented files; regional files; and local files
    of organisations and factories. the vptb files form the basis
    for producing russian-language abstracts of foreign inventions,
    for microfilming industrial designs and utility models of
    various countries, and for issuing various reference and
    information retrieval publications. the patent file system is
    being improved continuously. the philosophy governing this and
    techniques for selecting foreign patent documents for
    acquisition are described.
