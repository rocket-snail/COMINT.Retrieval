layer deduced from the frequency spectrum of radio
    propagation figures at long distance routes the hourly radio
    propagation quality figures for wwv received at many stations
    in canada were used as basic data assuming a suitable height
    for the layer its critical frequency at the reflection point of
    a transmission path could be obtained the values calculated
    compared fairly well with those obtained from vertical
    incidence soundings provided the correct mode of propagation
    had been used for the transmission path this analysis was also
    carried out during magnetic storms where no vertical incidence
    observations were obtainable
