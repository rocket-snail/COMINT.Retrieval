electromagnetic radiation from electrons rotating in an
    ionized medium under the action of a uniform magnetic field the
    radiation is shown to be predominantly in the extraordinary
    mode at the harmonics of the gyrofrequency of the fast electron
    the power radiated in the ordinary mode is a small percentage
    of that in the extraordinary mode but at the fundamental
    gyrofrequency it is lower by a factor where is the velocity of
    the fast electron and is the velocity of light the gyro theory
    of the suns nonthermal radiation is discussed this mechanism
    cannot explain the phenomena associated with noise bursts of
    type and although it is conceivable that type bursts may be of
    gyro origin
