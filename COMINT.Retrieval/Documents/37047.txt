the diurnal variation of irregular geomagnetic
    fluctuations the diurnal variation o the fluctuations showing a
    maximum in late evening for middle latitudes is correlated with
    atmospheric turbulence in the ionosphere which is assumed to be
    hindered in daytime by electromagnetic damping there is also a
    pronounced seasonal effect this may be connected with the large
    scale circulation of the atmosphere
