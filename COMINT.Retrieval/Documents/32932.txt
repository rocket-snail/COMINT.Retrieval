selfquenching in superregenerative parametric amplifiers
    a qualitative reasoning of the behaviour of cavity time
    parametric amplifiers in the u h f range using ge diodes is
    given for the condition of selfbias or external bias with high
    internal resistance applied to the diode increase in pump power
    makes frequency response multipeaked as with regenerative valve
    amplifiers in the coherent state
