containment of a fully ionized plasma by radio frequency
    fields a fully ionized plasma is treated as a compressible loss
    free dielectric in a rf field it is shown that there are steady
    forces which may be used to confine a body of dense plasma in a
    conducting cavity resonant in a suitable mode a particular
    solution the e cut off mode for which extensive numerical
    calculations have been made is discussed in some detail and
    interpreted in terms of possible physical experiments
