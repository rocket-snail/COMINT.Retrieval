the present and the future of local history
    bibliographies. since the end of world war ii, much greater
    attention has been paid to local history in bulgaria than was
    previously the case. staff in the regional central libraries
    have made a great effort to produce and publish relevant
    bibliographies and other material dealing with the past and
    present of their particular regions. as a rule, significant
    politicians and political events are well covered by such
    publications, as are writers and other prominent people who
    either live or lived in the region, or who were born there, but
    who are now more widely known. names of numerous publications
    are given, which can be considered valuable aids to those
    studying local history. topics dealing, for instance, with the
    regions' economy, cultural life, health service, arts and other
    aspects must not be neglected, as people need to know of social
    and other changes in their surroundings. gradually, the
    information given should be extended to include sma ller and/or
    specialised sections of the region, such as towns and
    particular industries.
