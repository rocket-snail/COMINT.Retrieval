microwave zeeman effect of free hydroxyl radicals the
    theory of the zeeman effect in levels of light diatomic
    radicals is extended to the general intermediate coupling case
    and used for detailed analysis of observed paramagnetic
    resonance absorption spectra at of the products of an electric
