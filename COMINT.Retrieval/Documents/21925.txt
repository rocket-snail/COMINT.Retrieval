the hall effect in metals at high frequencies theory is
    developed in terms of a surface hall coefficient calculations
    are made for a metal with two overlapping energy bands and the
    variations with frequency and with field strength are shown
    graphically for some special cases at very low frequencies the
    hall coefficient is constant over a range of higher frequencies
    it increases as the square root of the frequency and then
    becomes constant again the frequency variation of the phase
    angle between current and hall is also investigated
