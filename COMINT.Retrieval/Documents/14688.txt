what's that funny noise?' videogames in the library year
    ago, flesh public library, piqua, ohio, introduced an
    electronic learning centre to introduce the 25,000-strong
    predominantly rural community to the new technologies. the
    centre contains a public microcomputer, videotape and camera
    services, and a videogame console with 17 game cartridges. the
    videogames have attracted many young irregular library users
    who may, in time, extend their attention to other library
    facilities. the cost of establishing and maintaining the
    videogame area has been reasonable and problems of discipline,
    noise, and supervision have been minimal due to careful
    planning. no charge is made for playing the games.
