    commonly being staffed by a single librarian, and receive
    little publicity. in spite of their small size a significant
    number have a 'special library' character. teaching hospital
    libraries represent the intersection between the university and
    the n.h.s. library systems and are the largest of the libraries
    serving n.h.s. staff. data on usage and attitudes were
    collected by several different methods in the expectation that
    this would give a richer picture than would be provided by any
    one of conventional survey techniq ues. discusses the use of
