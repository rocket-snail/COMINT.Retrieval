space modulation of amplitude limited oscillations simple
    theoretical considerations show that demodulation can be
    achieved by using a detector with rectangular characteristic
    the amplitude modulated amplitude limited signal is converted
    by this detector into rectangular pulses whose width is
    determined by the rate of variation of the input signal voltage
    the amplitude modulation can then be detected by using a second
    detector having similar characteristics
