the additional dimension' david gerard on sound, vision
    and the lost creativity of the librarian. calls on librarians
    to make full use of electronic media and become again, for the
    1st time since the librarians of ancient greece, creative
    intermediaries and participants in the process of transmitting
    information. such media are open, vulnerable, can be
    interrupted, erased, reshaped, even falsified-they bring users
    closer to real experiences, offering an actuality denied to
    them in print. like life, electronic media are transient.
    print, meanwhile, has an air of permanence and authority when
    it really represents obsolescence.
