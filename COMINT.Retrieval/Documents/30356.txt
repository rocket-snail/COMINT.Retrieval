the management and social science literature' an
    interdisciplinary cross-citation analysis. a method is proposed
    for measuring interdisciplinary relations in scientific
    literature based on cross citation among core journals
    empirically selected on the basis of use and importance. the
    method is used to test hypotheses derived from a bibliometric
    definition of interdisciplinarity among the management and
    social science literatures. the results reveal that the
    management literature is dependent on the social sciences, that
    is more dependent on them than vice versa, and that it is more
    dependent on them than they are on each other.
