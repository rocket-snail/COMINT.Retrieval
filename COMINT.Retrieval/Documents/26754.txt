measurement of the specific charge o conduction electrons
    the theory of a method of determining by means of a special
    dynamo is given the device comprises a pair of concentric coils
    which together rotate with angular velocity about an axis
    parallel to the applied magnetic field the rectangular inner
    coil can also rotate about its own axis which is perpendicular
    ot the magnetic field the two resulting in the inner coil are
    due to induction and coriolis force acting on the conduction
    electrons if these are equal then where is the velocity of
    light and the magnetic field strength the estimated
    experimental errors are not greater than
