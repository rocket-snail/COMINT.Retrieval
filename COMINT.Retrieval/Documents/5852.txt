applying h.a. simon's model of limited rationality to
    scientific research and communication. a great number of
    specialist and non-specialist questions are asked about
    scientific research, concerning objectives, methods, results,
    organisation, policies and information sources. such questions
    can be collected and analysed for common denominators but
    recent work by andrews and his collaborators (1979) indicates
    this approach to be inadequate. uses simon's concept of limited
    rationality as a general model of individual and organisational
    operation, which is applied as an analytical framework for
    investigating research activities. the model does help in
    explanation of observations frequently made about research
    behaviour patterns' preference for informal information sources
    and personal contacts, and the formation of informal groups and
    networks. researchers and their organisations would appear to
    function within the boundaries of limited rationality. this
    model can also be used to predict pote ntial problems in
    scientific communication, such as the conception and use of
    thesauri and data banks. the quality of such information
    sources is crucial to the future of scientific research, hence
    the importance of understanding research behaviour.
