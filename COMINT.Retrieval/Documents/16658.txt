design of carrier frequency amplifiers with stagger tuned
    resonant circuits a simple rule is derived for the distribution
    of the poles ad a nomogram is given facilitating the design of
    an amplifier with flat response over a pass band of large
    relative width analysis is also given for the case of response
    ripples within predetermined limits values of the resonant
    circuit elements are calculated
