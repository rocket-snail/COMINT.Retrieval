the terminal question for wholesalers and the balance of
    trade. contribution to a special section on technology.
    although some wholesalers are well ahead of the rest of the
    canadian book distribution industry in applying new technology,
    they may have to change their approach if the distribution
    process is to be automated. us automated systems are geared to
    fast service from a nation-wide wholesale chain. canada has no
    such chain and wholesalers may have to form a consortium. a
    central coordinating agency has been suggested in a study by
    peat, marwick and mccarthy & mccarthy. many feel the need
    for better standards, particularly in the use of isbns. if
    canadian wholesalers do not act quickly, us wholesalers will
    take over.
