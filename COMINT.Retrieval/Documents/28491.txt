    public library's summer reading programme 'summer of fun' and
    other programmes, organised with the cooperation of
    huntington's public television station, wpby, reached over 500
    young people from pre-school age to young adults in 1981. young
    people showed a willingness to be guided and sustained by
    personal interest rather than inducements such as awards or
    certificates. it was evident that reading can lead to the
    development of other skills, as well as being stimulating in
    itself. evaluation of the 1981 programme will be used in the
    planning of the 1982 format.
