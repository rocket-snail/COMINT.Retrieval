a new method for investigating linear quadripoles z a
    treatment based on representation of impedance transformations
    by displacements on the surface of a sphere known graphical
    methods are made accessible to a purely geometric treatment by
    the method of projection problems of networks satisfying
    kirchhoffs laws can be solved with compasses and ruler
