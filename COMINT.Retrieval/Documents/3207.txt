elimination of unwanted modes of oscillation in
    cylindrical cavities the possible modes in high q cylindrical
    cavity resonators are analysed and the suppression of residual
    modes by special coupling systems or discontinuities inside the
    cavity is discussed measurements were made on ten tunable
    cavities of different size covering the frequency range a
    frequency modulated source was used to determine the
    permissible limits of the cavity tuning range and the
    dimensions of the discontinuities for obtaining the desired
    attenuation of unwanted modes without reducing q by more than
    the modes and their amplitudes are tabulated
