the 75th anniversary of the swiss social science archive.
    the swiss social science archive collects all swiss material
    and much from abroad on social problems and social science.
    stocks include 80,000 books, 600,000 newspaper cuttings and a
    pamphlet collection of 500,000 items. the archive has a keyword
    index of 350 terms; udc was used until 1959, when the archive
    invented its own decimal classification to provide more
    specialised coverage. it is sometimes hard to obtain the
    necessary non-commercial material but the archive receives many
    gifts of private collections. the archive has 12 staff and an
    annual budget of 900,000 fr, including contributions from the
    town and canton of zurich and from the federal government.
    swiss social science documentation has an important centre here
    and is being improved through the archive's work with other
    documentation centres.
