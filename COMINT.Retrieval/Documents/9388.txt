spin lattice relaxation it is pointed out that phonon
    relaxation times can be the dominant quantity measured in the
    usual saturation spin lattice relaxation measurements the
    analysis indicates how pulse measurements may be used to
    evaluate the actual spin lattice relaxation time independently
    of the phonon relaxation time
