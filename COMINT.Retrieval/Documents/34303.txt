design of low frequency constant time delay lines
    analysis is presented for ladder type low frequency delay lines
    consisting of pierce asymmetrical t sections each section
    having two unequal coils in series wound on a common core to
    give a coupling coefficient near unity a capacitor being
    connected from the junction of the coils to earth when properly
    terminated such delay lines give delays constant to within over
    of the pass band where many sections must be used they have the
    decided advantage of requiring only two components per section
    a double winding inductor and a capacitor
