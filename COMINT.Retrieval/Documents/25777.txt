minimum noise figure of the negative resistance amplifier
    using esaki diodes the minimum noise figure is determined for a
    nonreciprocal single stage amplifier and the result is extended
    to cover multistage amplifiers a noise figure of about can be
    achieved for high gain single stage or multistage
    amplifiers
