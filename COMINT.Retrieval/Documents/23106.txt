mailphone' a demonstration of man-machine relations in
    electronic mail networking. this technical report covering a
    12-month period (july '80-june '81) describes the design of the
    mailphone. the intent of this project is to show that new
    approaches to man-computer interface design can overcome
    serious problems associated with the underutilisation of
    military computer systems. the military computer system
    selected for improvement was the arpanet electronic mail
    system. the mmr improvements were realised by a complete
    redesign of the electronic mail interface, and demonstrated by
    the mailphone, a microprocessor-based system featuring a desk
    top unit purposely designed to resemble the familiar telephone.
    the mailphone, while complex technologically, is designed to be
    operationally both simple and friendly.
