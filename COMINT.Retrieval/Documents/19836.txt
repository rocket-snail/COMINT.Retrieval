carrier leak in rectifier modulators of the shunt type
    carrier leak is the term used for the unbalance carrier
    frequency component in the modulator output an experimental
    investigation is reported of factors affecting the attainment
    of very low leak levels from to below carrier level and of the
    possibilities of dc balancing of the rectifier bridge square
    wave and sinusoidal signals are considered the results indicate
    that control of carrier leak adjustment by use of a dc meter is
    likely to be practical the effect of carrier generator
    impedance is discussed some details are given for a modulator
    with no transformer very low leak levels are attainable by
    correct relative j adjustment of the two coupling
    capacitors
