research into an automation system for a national
    bibliography. the research project p-18-521-262-04 was
    concerned with detailed planning of an automated system for the
    slovak national bibliography and its interface with other
    systems in czechoslovakia and other socialist countries.
    overall, it can be said that the slovak national bibliography
    is computerised. by 1 oct 80, the bibliographical data base
    contained more than 100,000 complete bibliographical entries
    out of which 82,790 are entries 'articles 1979-1980', 15,370
    are entries 'books 1976-1980' and the rest are entries
    concerned with scientific experiments and other specialised
    topics. the number of direct users of slovak bibliography is
    not the only criterion of its impact since it enters into other
    information systems, data bases, catalogues, etc.
