a rationalist's critique of book selection for academic
    libraries. academic library collections have, historically,
    been selected by the faculty of the institution which they
    library serves. recently, however, much responsibility for
    collection development has devolved upon librarians who are
    eager to retain and amplify their role in this area. arguments
    presented in favour of lodging collection development
    responsiblity with librarians are, however, less than
    convincing and ignore important realities to make their case.
    librarians often confuse the ability to select books with
    accountability for such selection. argues that book selection
    is more properly and more adequately done by faculty members
    than librarians, and suggests a way of dealing with the problem
    of accountability often encountered when faculty are
    responsible for selection.
