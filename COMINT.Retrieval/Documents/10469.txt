telesoftware' prestel initiative will remove the
    barriers. prestel has provided the initial impetus for
    establishing a national computerised information service and
    has caused a great increase in the availability of cheap
    modems. argues that telesoftware (involving the automatic
    transmission of programs and data to microcomputers) could be 1
    of the most important developments in software distribution for
    hobbyists, education and business users. after briefly
    describing a telesoftware system developed by the council for
    educational technology, suggests how a realistic telesoftware
    service could evolve on prestel.
