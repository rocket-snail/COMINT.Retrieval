behavior and applications of ferrites in the microwave
    region both reciprocal and nonreciprocal devices comprising
    ferrite loaded waveguides are studied the nonreciprocal effects
    in the latter being based on bire fringence phase shift field
    displacement and coupling through apertures as well as on
    rotation of polarization a method called point field analysis
    facilitates qualitative investigation definitions are given of
    the gyrator the isolator and the circulator performance of some
    experimental devices is reported
