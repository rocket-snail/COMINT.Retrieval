characteristics of ultrasonic delay lines using quartz
    and barium titanate ceramic transducers equivalent circuit
    based analysis developed previously of fagen is extended to
    deal with metal delay media and with as well as quartz
    transducers calculations are made of the decrease in loss due
    to a decrease in the impedance of the delay medium and of the
    increase in bandwidth due to an increase in its
    impedance
