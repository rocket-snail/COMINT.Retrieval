a new pulse analyzer design description with detailed
    circuit diagrams of a single channel analyser which serves as
    the basic design for multichannel analysers details being given
    of a channel analyser positive pulses are accepted in the
    amplitude range plus the sum of channel widths the width and
    position of the channels can be changed quickly without
    requiring recalibration the design is simple and relatively few
    valves are required
