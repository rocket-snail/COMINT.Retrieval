nonlinear oscillators and the nyquist diagram two types
    of nonlinear oscillators having amplitude limiting are
    considered their equations become linear when a particular
    value is chosen for the parameter involving the amplitude a
    single curve can then be drawn for this particular value on the
    same principle as the ordinary nyquist curve other values of
    the parameter yield a family of curves showing the stages in
    the evolution of oc oscillations conditions for stable and
    unable oscillations are derived and the results extended to
    cover response to a small perturbation frequency stability and
    synchronization limits a brief account of part of the work was
    given in and of
