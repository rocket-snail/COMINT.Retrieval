agricultural libraries of nepal. agricultural research in
    nepal is under pressure to help increase food production.
    libraries to support this research are found at khumaltar,
    kirtipur, katmandu and teral. descriptions of these libraries
    are given. effective use of available library resources is
    limited by the lack of organisation of individual libraries and
    by the absence of interlibrary co-operation. trained library
    personnel are needed to change this situation and plans are
    being made to obtain them.
