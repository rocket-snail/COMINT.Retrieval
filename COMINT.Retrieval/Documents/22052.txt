whither sailis? thoughts on the role of the professional
    association. the founding of the south african institute for
    library and information science (sailis) as a national
    professional organisation has been favourably received
    nationally and internationally. its structure will be developed
    in the coming years to follow effectively the 2 basic
    principles laid down during its planning: that the entire
    library and information profession be catered for by a central
    professional organisation, and that provision be made for full
    development of interests and realisation of aspirations of
    every group in the profession. hopes that sailis will seriously
    consider a national library and information network and calls
    for a penetrating enquiry into the nature and scope of national
    library and information functions.
