servo control of the position and size of an optical
    scanning system a method of controlling the position and size
    of a television type raster relative to arbitrary references by
    means of four servo mechanisms is described one of the
    applications of such a system is that of a reading device for
    punched cards a system for reading any one of a stack of cards
    without removing the selected card has been developed using the
    servo controlled raster the design of the servo mechanisms for
    this application is described in detail
