oscillator characteristic equation the equation for an
    oscillator circuit using a triode is developed in a form
    involving the differential coefficients of the dynamic
    resistance of the triode measurements on a hartley oscillator
    are reported which are in good agreement with the theoretical
    results over most of the oscillation characteristic particular
    features of the oscillation characteristics are discussed and
    the constants of the triode and the tank circuit are deduced
    from them
