on the molecular theory of electrostriction the case of a
    sphere of fluid dielectric subjected to a uniform external
    field is discussed from both macroscopic and microscopic points
    of view that part of the spur of the stress tensor which
    depends quadratically on the applied field is calculated for
    both nonpolar and dipolar dielectrics the lorenz lorentz and
    debye theories lead to the result that is zero but more modern
    theories lead to a different result
