simultaneous oscillation at three natural frequencies in
    nonlinear feedback circuits the steady states of a nonlinear
    feedback loop with three degrees of freedom are investigated
    under the assumption of quasilinearity with reference to the
    theory of multimode oscillators experimental results and
    practical applications of the effect are discussed
