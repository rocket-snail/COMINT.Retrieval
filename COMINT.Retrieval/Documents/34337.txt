a viewdata interface for arbitrary computer programs.
    describes the main algorithms in a computer program for
    interfacing a viewdata terminal with arbitrary application
    computer programs (which were not specially written for the
    terminal). the interface handles the problems of partioning the
    input and output to or from the application to suit the small
    and non-scrolling screen of the viewdata terminal.
