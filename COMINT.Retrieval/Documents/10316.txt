an electronic random selector criteria for recognition of
    random series are stated and methods for producing such series
    are discussed a description is given of an arrangement in which
    pulses are applied to a circuit which is gated periodically any
    pulse passing tr through the gate triggers a multivibrator
    which is in turn coupled to a pair of mechanical registers two
    such circuits make up the complete selector enabling four
    mechanical registers to operate use of the selector in
    psychical research is mentioned
