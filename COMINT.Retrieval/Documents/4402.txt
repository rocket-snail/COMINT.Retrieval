inhomogeneous transmission lines as filters mathematical
    treatment of the filtering action of a transmission line with
    periodic structure design is based on an approximate integral
    formula expressing reflection coefficient as a function of
    characteristic impedance its application in a simple case shows
    that the centre frequency is determined by the length of a
    section and the width of the stop band is dependent only on the
    total length the number of sections the formula gives results
    in good agreement with e periment for a single section filter
    with ratio improved matrix and determinant methods for solving
    networks it is shown that a linear electrical network which may
    include valves and transformers can br represented
    topologically by a network composed entirely of elements of a
    single type comprises four nodes and two directed branches it
    is also shown that a linear electrical network can be
    represented algebraically by a matrix termed an h matrix if the
    elements of the network are shown in the network diagram in the
    form of elements of the above type the h matrix can be written
    down directly from the network diagram
