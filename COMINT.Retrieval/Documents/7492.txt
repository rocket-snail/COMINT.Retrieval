on-line forecasting capabilities' futurscan and its
    alternatives. provides an overview of the field of on-line
    information retrieval systems whose data bases are programmed
    to predict future events. these systems rely on data of past
    events and use mathematical techniques such as regression
    analysis and statistical probability to provide forecast data.
    the history of these systems is traced through the advent of
    the ibm quicktran program in 1967 and descriptions of 13 other
    predictive systems. recent trend impact analysis studies have
    led to the development of interax and futurscan, which offer
    sophisticated and complex predictive on-line capabilities.
