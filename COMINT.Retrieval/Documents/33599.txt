correlation of the initial electric field and the radar
    echo in thunderstorms precipitation as detected with radar is a
    necessary but not sufficient condition for significant cloud
    electrification the presence of detectable precipitation does
    not lead to thunderstorm electrification unless the
    precipitation echo shows rapid vertical development
