extending school library and community information
    services to a scattered population' papua new guinea. it will
    be apparent from the problems facing papua new guinea today;
    the obstacles found in the terrain, the inadequate road
    systems, the cultural and linguistic diversity, the unequal
    social and educational development of its people, that the
    establishment of a nationwide library service, even at the
    primary school level, and the spread of information relevant to
    the people's way of life and helpful in a time of urgent
    change, is an enormous task. to speak of extending services
    where almost none exist would be to ignore the realities
    affecting the development of school libraries and other means
    of keeping people informed through the medium of print. some
    proposals for increasing the efficiency of primary schools to
    enable them to serve the community in different ways are
    offered.
