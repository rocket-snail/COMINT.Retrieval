in sight out: 'am i my brother's keeper?'. presents an
    annotated list of publications aimed at helping us churches
    respond to the aged and the mentally retarded/developmentally
    disabled. suggests that the library could supply this
    information to local churches; acquire the publications for
    their own collections; and read the material to learn about
    providing services to these people. it has been said that the
    parish is the door to participation for the handicapped and
    that the pastor must keep the door always open. couldn't
    'library' be substituted for 'parish' and 'librarian' for
    'pastor'?.
