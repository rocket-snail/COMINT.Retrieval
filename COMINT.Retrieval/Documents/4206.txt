reciprocity of the transmissive properties of any
    multiple layer for electromagnetic waves a full analytical
    proof is given that the transmission of a perpendicularly
    incident plane em wave through a multiple layer consisting of
    any number of plane parallel absorbing or nonabsorbing
    components is the same in both directions if the first and last
    media have the same absorption index ie if if and are different
    the ratio of the transmission factors in the two directions is
    treatment is simplified by applying quadripole theory but this
    does not give a closed expression for the overall transmission
    factor the validity of the kirchhoff inversion principle is
    illustrated
