successful conversion in moss. moss library, norway, was
    purpose-built in 1927, but until 1980 other local government
    departments occupied all but the ground floor. in 1978 it
    became possible to convert the whole building for library use.
    the library now occupies 1292 sq.m. on 3 floors. the basement
    houses stacks, a study-room and a story-hour room. lending
    departments occupy the ground floor, and reading and
    periodicals rooms the 1st floor. a tower wing houses the
    librarian's office, local collection and microfilm equipment.
    while extra space for exhibitions, study places and a music
    department would be valuable, the conversion is felt to be a
    success by both staff and public.
