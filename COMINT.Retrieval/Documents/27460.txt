a sine wave generator with periods of hours an inverse
    function generator based on the difference amplifier is
    examined and examples of its use are considered in a
    logarithmic voltmeter and for sine triangle waveform
    transformation triangle sine transformation can be achieved by
    negative feed back a vlf triangular waveform obtained from a cr
    circuit and relay is thus converted to an accurate sine wave
    without transients
