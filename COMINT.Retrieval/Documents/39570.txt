results of observations of discrete emitters of cosmic
    radio emission on wavelength results are given of a
    determination of the flux at originating from the omega nebula
    orion nebula cassiopeia taurus supernova and a source near the
    galactic centre sagittarius when these values are plotted
    together with observations at other radio wavelengths and in
    the case of the crab nebula also at optical wavelengths the
    results suggest that one mechanism may be responsible for
    radiation both at optical and radio wavelengths
