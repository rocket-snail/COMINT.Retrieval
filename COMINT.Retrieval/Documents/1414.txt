tunable rc bridge network with only one variable element
    a circuit is described with which an output of required phase
    is obtained by varying either one resistance or one capacitance
    the magnitude of the output voltage remaining constant details
    are given of a stable valve generator with frequency ranging
    from a very low value to the circuit can also be used in phase
    shifters frequency meters and selective amplifiers
