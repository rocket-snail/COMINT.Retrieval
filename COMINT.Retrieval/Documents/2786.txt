the duality of classification' taxonomy and meronomy.
    contribution to a section on current trends in classification
    research. in the context of natural classification systems
    development, classification is viewed as the grouping of
    objects in classes (taxons) and as the finding of common
    structures (archetypes) within the objects. an archetype is a
    structure of parts (merons). the classification procedure can
    be represented as an interactive process whereby the grouping
    by taxons alternates with the identification of taxon
    archetypes, which are used again to update the taxon
    composition. presents a mathematical description of the
    relationship between the taxonomic grouping of objects and
    their partitioning into merons, with special mention of the
    methodological problems of classification.
