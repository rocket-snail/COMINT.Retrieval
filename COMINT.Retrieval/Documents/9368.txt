lcs' automated resource sharing in illinois. the library
    computer system (lcs) network in illinois provides circulation
    control for its member libraries. in addition, resource sharing
    has been implemented by allowing each member library to search
    and borrow items from the collections of the other members. the
    network is comprised of the 3 campuses of the university of
    illinois and 14 other academic libraries in the state. the
    collective lcs data base contains over 10 million volumes. each
    lcs member library can better serve its patrons because its
    access goes beyond its individual collection to the entire lcs
    data base.
