propagation of plane electromagnetic waves in
    inhomogeneous media the laws of propagation along the direction
    are derived for infinite inhomogeneous media in which
    dielectric constant and electrical conductivity are functions
    of and the magnetic permeability is constant homogeneous media
    are treated as special cases
