a relation between solar radio emission and polar cap
    absorption of cosmic noise a statistical study has been made of
    the relation it appears that the polar cap absorption events
    are closely associated with the occurrence of wide band cm wave
    outbursts of type four events and their duration is related to
    the presence on the sun of active regions of noise
    storms
