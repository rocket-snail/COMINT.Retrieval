non chapman like variations in the ionospheric e and f
    layers effect of the sq current system part variations in e and
    f are examined in various months in addition to those of march
    which have already been discussed see of and it is shown that
    in non equinoctial months e is larger in the winter hemisphere
    than in the summer hemisphere for the same solar zenith
    distance this unsymmetrical distribution is interpreted as
    being due to the sq current system effect in the e layer the sq
    current system developing more strongly in summer than in
    winter somewhat similar results are observed for the f layer
    but detailed examination shows that they can be explained by
    the temperature difference between the summer and winter
    hemispheres
