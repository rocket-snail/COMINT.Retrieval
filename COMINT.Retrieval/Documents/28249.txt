multistage resonance absorbers for centimetre
    electromagnetic waves a three stage dipole resonance absorber
    is drived from the two stage absorber described in of schmitt
    by the addition of a second dipole grid at a distance of in
    front of the metal surface the frequency characteristics of the
    reflection coefficient are calculated and compared with the
    results of measurements
