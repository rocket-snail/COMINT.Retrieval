the auroral layer ionization and auroral luminosity an
    empirical relation is established between the photon emission
    within the negative nitrogen bands of aurorae in zenith and the
    maximum electron density in the layer the recombination
    coefficient in the layer during aurorae is in medium to strong
    aurorae the mean electron density deduced from critical
    frequencies is between and electrons echoes observed during
    aurorae may be explained as back scatter from the ground
    reflected at low incidence from the auroral layer
