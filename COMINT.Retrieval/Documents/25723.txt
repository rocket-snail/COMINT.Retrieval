recent developments in the hertfordshire library service.
    (abridged version of an article in the herts library service's
    'library automation project newsletter no. 7'.) hertfordshire
    library service has awarded a contract to automated library
    systems (als) for an on-line circulation control system. als
    will be using existing bar codes to permit the issue, return,
    renewal and reservation of library materials, with on-line
    borrower registration and enquiry and on-line book accessioning
    and enquiry to a short entry catalogue. access will be by
    acronymic keys to author and title, by control number and class
    number. if all goes well, hitchin and hemel hempstead will 'go
    live' to the public at the end of 1981.
