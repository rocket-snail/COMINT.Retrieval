a rectifier modulator with stable low carrier leak the
    action of a constant current ring modulator in which the input
    transformer is replaced by high impedance valve circuits is
    analysed in detail the theoretical analysis is confirmed
    experimentally using a carrier frequency stable carrier leak
    levels more than below the carrier current from each source are
    possible
