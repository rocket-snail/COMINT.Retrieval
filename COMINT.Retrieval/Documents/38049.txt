the school of library service at dalhousie university.
    the school of library service, dalhousie university, halifax,
    nova scotia, was established in 1969, in response to the need
    for library education within canada's atlantic provinces. a
    pragmatic educational approach encourages students to work with
    books as material objects, with courses in printing history,
    bookbinding and preservation. the school's emphasis on the
    physical book is seen as an example all library schools should
    follow.
