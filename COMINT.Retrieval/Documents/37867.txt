diachronous vs. synchronous study of obsolescence. (phd
    thesis-university of illinois at urbana-champaign). a
    comparison of 2 ways of measuring obsolescence within the
    subject of human and medical genetics. synchronous studies
    (which are made on records of use or bibliographic references
    made at 1 point in time and compare the use against the age
    distribution of the material used or cited) are more easily
    applied and produce equivalent results to the apparently more
    theoretically desirable diachronous studies (which follow the
    use of particular items through successive observations at
    different dates).
