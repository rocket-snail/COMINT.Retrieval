choosing a microcomputer for the library. an analysis
    (based loosely on the author's recent experiences) of the
    hardware, software and information sources available to
    librarians considering adding a microcomputer to their
    retrieval and administrative tools. to reduce development time
    and cost, library procedures should be modified to match
    available software where possible, rather than commissioning
    new software.
