investigation of nonreciprocal quadripoles in the
    centimetre wave range devices based on the faraday rotation of
    guided waves are investigated see eg of a method is developed
    for determining the quadripole parameters of these devices a
    waveguide arrangement adapted for measurements on gyrators is
    described results are given for a gyrator using ferroxcube iv
    factors to be considered in designing gyrators for particular
    applications are indicated see also of
