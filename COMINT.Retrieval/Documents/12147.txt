method of investigating secondary emission in conductors
    bombarded by ions several oscillographic methods are discussed
    an the double modulation method is described in detail the ion
    beam is modulated by a rectangular pulse and the secondary
    emission electrode potential by a lf sawtooth pulse the
    principal advantage of this method is the possibility of
    separating the true secondary ions from those produced by the
    heating due to the bombardment oscillograms of the current
    voltage characteristics of the secondary emission are shown for
    ta and w specimens bombarded by rb ions
