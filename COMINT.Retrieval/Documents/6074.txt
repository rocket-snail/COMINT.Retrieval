on the space charge divergence of an axially symmetric
    beam the usual assumptions made in estimating the space charge
    effect are consistent with a coaxial cylindrical conducting
    boundary for small amounts of divergence a hyperbola solution
    is suggested this may in some cases be as good as or better
    than the usual solution even when divergence is not
    small
