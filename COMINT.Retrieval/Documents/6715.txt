hit rates of radio propagation disturbance warnings and
    swi warnings in order to improve the hit rate defined as the
    number of hits divided by the number of issued forecasts it is
    suggested that long distance propagation characteristics should
    be studied to account for the fall in hit rate in winter that
    forecasting should be reduced to three or four days ahead and
    that although swi warnings are fairly good there should be a
    further study of solar radio noise
