the state of bibliography in hungary. reviews progress
    made in the compilation of bibliographies in hungary since the
    national working conference on bibliography in 1961 had
    identified large gaps in coverage and the need for
    coordination. the national szechenyi library has made
    considerable efforts to develop an up-to-date system for the
    hungarian national bibliography; the greatest bibliography of
    the period 1921-44. progress in special bibliographies has been
    haphazard with overlap in some fields while certain other
    fields such as mathematics and physics have no current
    bibliographies. it is to be feared that without a coordinating
    body to plan bibliographic activities, it will take a long time
    to have a complete system of bibliographies in hungary.
