    general accounting office has concluded that increasing use of
    data telecommunications calls for strong privacy protection and
    improved economies, after conducting a review of civil agency
    data telecommunications networks and related privacy issues.
    the office has recommended to the senate committee on the
    judiciary and house committee on government operations that
    congress revise 'wiretap' laws to strengthen protective
    provisions; and that the director of the office of management
    and budget issue extra executive level protective policies and
    guidelines for data transmissions of personal data, and make a
    comprehensive study to provide information to congress on the
    merits and problems of implementating a common-user data
    telecommunications network for the civil government.
