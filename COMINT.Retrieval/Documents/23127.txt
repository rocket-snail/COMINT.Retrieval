microwave emission from high temperature plasmas energy
    losses from cyclotron radiation are concluded to be negligible
    for plasma temperatures less than and probably for those
    greater than emission at the fundamental frequency and first
    few harmonics is detectable and measurement of the relative
    intensities offers a means of determining the plasma
    temperature
