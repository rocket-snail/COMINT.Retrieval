    evaluation. (fla thesis.) a study of the automated circulation
    control system developed at bath university library (uk) with
    burroughs machines ltd. traces the development of the project
    from the initial plans, through design and implementation to
    operation, and gives a detailed description of the
    system-equipment, programs, input, output and backup. examines
    the problems encountered during the use of the system and
    action taken to remedy some of these, with possible solutions
    to other problems. these problems led to suspension of the

    has proved reliable and satisfactory.
