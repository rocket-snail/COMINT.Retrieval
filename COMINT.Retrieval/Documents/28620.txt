auto self excited transductors and push pull circuit
    theory the modes of operation of transductors with parallel
    bridge and centre tap connections are explained expressions are
    derived for the sensitivity and time constant under idealized
    conditions an examination is made of the use of transductors in
    push pull pairs to obtain magnetic amplifiers with outputs
    whose polarity depends on the signal sense the transductors are
    assumed to e be of the auto self excited type with resistance
