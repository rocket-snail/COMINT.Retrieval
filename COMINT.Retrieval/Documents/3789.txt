analysis of information flow and obsolescence in the
    literature of biological membranes. surveys information
    transfer and obsolescence in the literature of
    medico-biological research on membranes in the period 1962-79.
    a statistical analysis of literature on international research
    relying upon the 2index medicus 1has shown that the 1st
    progressive stage of research on membranes falls between 1966
    and 1972. after a relative stagnation in 1972-75 international
    literature shows development trends again. detailed
    professional analysis indicates dynamic development of some
    basic research fields (e.g. artificial membranes) from 1972
    on.
