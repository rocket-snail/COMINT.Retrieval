synthesis of transfer functions with poles restricted to
    the negative real axis a procedure for the synthesis of general
    rc transfer c functions by means of unbalanced networks is
    described the transfer function need not be minimum phase but
    may have zeros anywhere in the complex plane except on the
    positive real axis use is made of techniques described by
    guillemin of but the r problem is simplified by use also of a
    network theorem due to adler enabling zero shifting to be
    performed in two directions from within the tootal network in
    an example worked out network elements are used whereas the
    guillemin procedure would require
