the preparatory committee for uncstd: focus on
    information. report on the fifth session of the preparatory
    committee on the uncstd (united nations conference on science
    and technology for development) draft programme of action and
    especially its decisions regarding information services. there
    was evidence, particularly among developing countries, of a
    great need for information to help in the assessment and
    application of technology to development and there was clearly
    a lack of knowledge about existing information facilities.
    recommendations called on developing countries to make their
    information resources more accessible to developing countries
    and called for an international information exchange network.
    the network would make full use of existing specialised
    information networks and consist of a series of subnetworks in
    each developed and developing countries.
