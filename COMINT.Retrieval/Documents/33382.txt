solar brightness distribution at a wavelength f
    centimeters part the quiet sun observations were made with a
    element interferometer to check staniers results obtained with
    a two aerial interferometer the observed limb brightening is
    reasonably consistent with that reported by obrien tandberg
    hanssen whereas stanier found no limb brightening the
    divergences may be related to actual differences consequent on
    the changing phase of the solar cycle
