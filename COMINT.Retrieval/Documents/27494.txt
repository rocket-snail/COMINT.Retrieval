a mathematical analysis of a dielectric amplifier the
    fundamental principles of operation of dielectric amplifiers
    are outlined and a basic circuit with resistive load is
    analysed in detail it is assumed that the hysteresis curve of
    the dielectric is represented by a hyperbolic sine function
    expressions are calculated for the steady state input and
    output currents and the time constant of the amplifier is
    estimated from consideration of the transient response
