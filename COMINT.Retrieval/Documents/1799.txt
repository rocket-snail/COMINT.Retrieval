a triode fm discriminator the triode is arranged to
    operate as a gated rectifier with the gating time and hence the
    rectified output dependent on the input frequency a sine wave
    with the straight portion extending over about one radian can
    be used for the input waveform for a particular circuit in
    which the rectified output should theoretically change by about
    for a frequency change for this frequency difference was about
    the output is proportional to input amplitude as well as to
    frequency
