investigation of the energy distribution of secondary
    electrons from single crystals of copper covered with single
    crystal layers of copper oxide the secondary electron energy
    was measured by the retarding field method the energy
    distribution curve is steeper towards the low energy side in
    the case of polycrystalline cu covered with polycrystalline cu
    one well defined maximum was observed in the single crystal
    case subsidiary maxima were also found but the evidence for
    these is not conclusive the results are shown
    graphically
