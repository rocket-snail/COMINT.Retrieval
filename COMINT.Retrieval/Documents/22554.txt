how to generate accurate sawtooth and pulse waves two
    circuits giving stable sawtooth and rectangular pulse outputs
    are described in which a high speed switching transistor is
    controlled by a zener diode pulse width and amplitude and
    waveform timing are independent of active elements in the
    circuit
