a self consistent calculation of the dissociation of
    oxygen in the upper atmosphere a model is considered similar to
    that previously proposed of but with the requirement of
    radiative energy balance abandoned and with a particular
    temperature distribution assumed calculations indicate a much
    narrower dissociation region occurring at a lower
    altitude
