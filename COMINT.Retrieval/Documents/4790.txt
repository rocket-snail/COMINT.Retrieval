a theory of trapping of whistlers in field aligned
    columns of enhanced ionization using ray theory it is shown
    that the condition for whistler propagation in ducts depends on
    the ratio of the electron density in the column to that of the
    background the theory explains part of the variation of
    whistler rate with latitude
