induction of currents by moving charges an analysis is
    made of the field due to a charge moving between a pair of
    parallel disk electrodes connected externally by a conductor a
    general expression for the current flowing through the
    conductor is derived in terms of the electrode radius and
    separation and the velocity of the charge a periodic discharge
    could be obtained with particular values of and u
