transient responses with limited overshoot the problem is
    considered of designing a system transfer function such that in
    the response to a step function input the overshoot shall be
    limited and consist largely of the principal mode of
    oscillation a method is stated by which the size of any real
    term in the response may be calculated relative to the maximum
    value of the principal model graphical conditions are given
    restricting the permissible pole and zero positions in certain
    cases when this ratio is specified the procedure is illustrated
    by examples
