    danish diane centre, opened in june 81. the commission of the
    eec had in 1972 decided to set up a european data transmission
    network, euronet, operated by the national telecommunication

    in the face of us competition. the 36 hosts, organisations and
    private service bureaux, which offer access to information in
    the form of 271 different data bases and data banks, are
    gathered under the network diane. distinguishes between data
    bases, usually storing bibliographic data, and data banks,
    mostly with instantly usable data. full text bases and
    registers of activities and addresses are also gaining in
    importance. to spread the knowledge of euronet-diane's
    information services, advisory centres are set up in the
    individual countries, viz. the danish diane centre. the centre
    hopes to advise on all data bases and data banks wh ich can be
    used in denmark, including us, european and scandinavian
    networks. the centre aims to advise on the optimal use of
    on-line information services through direct assistance to
    individuals, courses and publications.
