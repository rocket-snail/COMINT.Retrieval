    things about us?. detailed review of the functions, aims and
    objectives of king research, inc. (kri), data analysts in
    library and information science, based in rockville, maryland.
    although kri sometimes initiates its own research projects, it
    usually bases its work on requests from other agencies and
    associations, such as the us department of commerce and the
    american library association. if a request looks interesting,
    kri prepares a proposal indicating why it, rather than its
    competitors, should conduct the research, and in the average
    month the company handles more than 15 projects, with most
    staff members working on several projects at once.
