diurnal variations of density and scale height in the
    upper atmosphere the radio echo meteor technique has been used
    to calculate the neutral particle densities diurnal
    oscillations in density are found with amplitudes semidiurnal
    oscillations are also present having approximately half these
    amplitudes
