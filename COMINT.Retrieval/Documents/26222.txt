the induction of electric currents in a uniformly
    conducting circular disk by the sudden creation of magnetic
    poles using toroidal coordinates a riemann space of two regions
    is constructed as in sommerfelds methods of multiform
    potentials and the riemann potential for a single magnetic pole
    is determined jeans treatment of uniform finite plane current
    sheets is applied to the case of the circular disk numerical
    results being given for a particular example
