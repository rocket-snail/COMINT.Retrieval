velocity of electron pulses the transit time of a brief
    pulse of electrons of known energy across a measured distance
    was determined by an arrangement involving two deflection gates
    opened sequentially for very brief intervals by a single surge
    travelling in a cable an electron multiplier was used as
    collector about of the electrons arrived within of the mean
    transit time the most probable transit time could be
    ascertained within the apparatus can be used as a velocity
    spectrograph and as a chronograph for measuring the time of
    rise of very steep surges
