communication today and tomorrow; (electronics in the
    libraries of the '90's). the history of library information
    provision has undergone 4 phases' (1) stock formation; (2)
    automation of library and information processes; (3)
    information flow and intensive stock growth; (4) development of
    electronic communication. the combination of electronic
    teletype with video terminals facilitated information
    transmission. the telefax equipment transmits a facsimile of
    the information along a telephone network. the 'electronic
    post' transmits communications from one person to another.
    systems have evolved for transmitting information onto domestic
    tv screens. utilisation of tv channels facilitated the creation
    of automated systems providing information to a wide circle of
    consumers. closed-circuit tv systems permit libraries to
    disseminate information selectively. recently videorecordings,
    using high information capacity disk videoplayers, have been
    introduced into libraries.
