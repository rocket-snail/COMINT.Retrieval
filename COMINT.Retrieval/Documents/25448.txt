the need for technology assessment in libraries. the ways
    in which librarians respond to the new technology will
    determine, in part, the library's place in the culture of the
    years to come. a method called technology assessment will aid
    librarians in this area. the method consists of 7 steps' (1)
    define the task of the assessment; (2) describe the new
    hardware in depth; (3) develop the state-of-the-library
    assumptions; (4) identify impact areas and effects of the new
    device; (5) make a preliminary impact analysis; (6) identify
    possible alternatives; (7) complete the impact analysis.
