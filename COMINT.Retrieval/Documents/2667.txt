some exact solutions in nonlinear oscillations a rigorous
    analysis is made of forced oscillation mechanical or electrical
    systems for certain cases which are specified by the condition
    that the condition that the forced oscillation has a waveform
    similar to that of the external force the stability conditions
    are derived from hills equation which can be solved exactly for
    the present cases
