further observations of radio emission from the planet
    jupiter characteristics of radiation at are described in detail
    the radiation appears to be random noise varying rapidly in
    intensity and its short term characteristics can be affected
    markedly by the terrestrial ionosphere three main sources of
    noise are apparent but none can be identified with visual
    features the great variability and spectral concentration of
    the radiation suggests an origin in some form of plasma
    oscillation in an ionized region having a critical frequency of
    about see also of
