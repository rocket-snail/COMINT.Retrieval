speaking for a cinderella' unplanned decentralized
    interlending. revised version of part of a paper presented to
    the international seminar on national document provision,
    boston spa, 22-24 sept 80. 4 types of national interlending
    systems have been identified. models a, b, and c represent
    planned centralisation or decentralisation. model d is
    unplanned decentralisation. it occurs frequently and, if the
    time and money necessary for better models are lacking, an
    upgraded version can be used. the cost of the necessary union
    catalogues can be decreased by automation. speed of supply by
    and goodwill of net lenders can be improved by cost recovery.
    alternative methods of payment should be considered, including
    a system based on an international guarantee fund.
