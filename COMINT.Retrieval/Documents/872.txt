loci curve theory applied to high frequency networks the
    application of the method is shown for the evaluation of such
    response curves of four terminal networks as are produced by
    the variation of one parameter examples are given of the
    calculation of a wide band thermistor mount using a rectangular
    admittance chart and the variation of the input reflection
    coefficient with frequency of a given transformer using a smith
    chart
