an approximate graphical analysis of the steady state
    response of nonlinear networks an approximate graphical
    analysis is given for the case when one of the circuit
    parameters is varied gradually transients and the generation of
    subharmonics are not dealt with the networks investigated
    consist of a nonlinear iron cored inductor with a linear
    resistor and linear capacitor the results of the analysis can
    be applied to the investigation of the effects of resistive or
    reactive loads of magnetic amplifiers and the utilization of
    jump phenomena ferroresonance effects in switching
    devices
