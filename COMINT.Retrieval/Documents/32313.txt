movement of sporadic ionization the horizontal movement
    of patches of daytime sporadic ionization has been observed by
    using system of spaced pulse transmitters and a central
    recorder the directions of movement are mainly between these
    velocities differ in direction from the region disturbances
    recorded at the same time and have only about half the
    speed
