the plannable and unplannable (ii)' libraries as the
    infrastructure of preservation and change. lecture given at the
    annual conference of the german library association and the
    association of librarians in north rhine-westphalia, bielefeld,
    oct 80. (for part 1, 2see1 previous abstract). libraries exist
    to fulfil human needs for education, information, communication
    and general self-development. future library planning must pay
    more attention to the balance of stationary and mobile elements
    in a system, to local needs and to adult education. both
    qualified librarians and voluntary helpers can make valuable
    contributions to library services; staff of high calibre are
    more important than the media themselves or advanced technical
    equipment. too much technology in a library can alienate the
    readers. it is difficult to generalise about minimum standards;
    each library needs its own identity.
