a study of surface roughness and its effect on the back
    scattering cross section of spheres experimental data obtained
    by measuring the back scattering cross section of a large rough
    sphere at three frequencies in the s x and k bands are
    presented even for a sphere whose depth of roughness is as
    large as the measured change in cross section is no more than
    this is in good agreement with the theoretical
    prediction
