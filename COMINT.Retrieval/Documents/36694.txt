dissipative networks with third order maximally flat
    amplitude characteristics an analysis is made of dissipative
    low pass networks a simple chande of t e frequency variable
    allows the results to be applied to bead pass networks for the
    case of narrow band operation the concept of quarter wave
    coupling is developed and the equivalent triple tuned circuit
    conf guration is derived
