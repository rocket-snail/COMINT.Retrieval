    describes the methods and information sources used by the state
    scientific and technical library of lithuanian ssr for
    provision of factographic information services. the sources of
    factographic information include mainly trade literature,
    standards and patent documentation. because not all

    library, the library cooperates closely with the central
    scientific research institute for patent information and
    technical and economical research, with the all-union
    scientific research institute for technical information,
    classification and coordination and with a number of special
    scientific and technical libraries in the ussr and in other
