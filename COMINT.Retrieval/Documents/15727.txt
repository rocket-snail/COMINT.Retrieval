the "plankalkul" of konrad zuse: a forerunner of today's
    programming languages plankalkul was an attempt by korrad zuse
    in the 1940's to devise a notational and conceptual system for
    writing what today is termed a program. although this early
    approach to a programming language did not lead to practical
    use, the plan is described here because it contains features
    that are standard in today's programming languages. the
    investigation is of historical interest; also, it may provide
    insights that would lead to advancements in the state of the
    art. using modern programming terminology, the plankalkul is
    presented to the extent it has possible to reconstruct it from
    the published literature. july, 1972 bauer, f. l. wossner, h.
