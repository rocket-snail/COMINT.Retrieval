final report of the precis/translingual project. the
    feasibility of providing precis with extra facilities to enable
    it to function as a system for switching indexing data between
    2 or more natural languages was investigated. lexicons were
    established in 3 languages, and a 'pivot file' created to link
    them. routines for switching indexing terms out of a given
    source language and into a chosen target language were devised
    and set down in the form of flow-charts or algorithms. using
    these algorithms, precis strings were switched mainly between
    english, french, and german. problems of translation were
    solved by the use of 'lexical blocks' and the adoption of a
    system of categories. mechanisms for the automatic provision of
    articles in french and german strings were designed. 2 methods
    of providing inflected forms of nouns by algorithm were tested
    in german and polish. the use of 'substitute' phrases in precis
    was investigated, and procedures for the automatic provision
    and construction of phrases in a target language were devised.
    algorithms designed to build prepositional or adjectival
    phrases were tested on english, french, and german precis
    strings.
