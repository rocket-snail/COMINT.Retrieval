the solar flare type variation in geomagnetic field and
    the integrated electrical conductivity of the ionosphere part
    assuming that the solar flare type of variation of the
    geomagnetic field is caused by anomalous increase of the
    electrical conductivity of the ionosphere treatment based on
    the dynamo theory gives a value for the integrated conductivity
    of the ionosphere of the order of which is in good agreement
    with the value deduced from ionospheric observations
