the performance of pyrolytic carbon resistors the major
    factors affecting performance are carbon film thickness
    moisture permeability and thickness of protective coating
    operating temperature and the quality of the ceramic substrate
    the effect of these factors is small if the carbon film has a
    thickness of at least a
