research libraries of the archdiocese of vienna. unlike
    many other german speaking dioceses, vienna has no diocesan
    library as such but there are several academic libraries
    attached to various institutions besides the public libraries
    administered by the church. brief histories are given of the 9
    existing academic libraries of the diocese. the seminary
    library is the largest, with 65,000 volumes and the
    archdiocesan library is the oldest, founded in 15th century,
    and housing 30,000 volumes. other libraries are relatively new
    and quite small. more coordination between them would be
    mutually beneficial as well as greater cooperation with the
    public sector.
