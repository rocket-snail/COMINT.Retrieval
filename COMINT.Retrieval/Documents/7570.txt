chinese collections in the u.s.a. a report of a study
    trip in 1979, sponsored by the commission for franco-american
    cultural exchange to investigate chinese collections in u.s.
    libraries. based on visits to six libraries and attendance at
    the annual conference of the committee on east asian libraries.
    the chief problem in the u.s.a. is lack of finance, which
    affects acquisition programmes, personnel, and storage, with
    consequent delays in processing and cataloguing activities.
    attempted solutions, such as initiation of attractive
    development programmes to attract finance, and use of voluntary
    student labour, are described. greater cooperation seems
    essential, and it is proposed that a programme of cooperation
    between u.s. and paris libraries specialising in chinese
    material be implemented.
