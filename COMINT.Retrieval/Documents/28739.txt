on anomalous variations of maximum electron density and
    its height in the region of the ionosphere an examination of
    world wide observations during periods of sunspot maximum and
    minimum suggests that anomalous behaviour of the f region is
    mainly controlled in low and middle latitudes by geomagnetic
    factors and in higher latitudes by geographic factors the fall
    in the level corresponding to maximum electron concentration
    over the magnetic equator may be accounted for by vertical
    electron drifts whose magnitudes are deduced seasonal anomalies
    in f may be explained by variations in the height distribution
    of the particles from which the ions in the region are
    produced
