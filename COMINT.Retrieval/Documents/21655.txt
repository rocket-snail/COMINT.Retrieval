congressional committee reports. the importance of us
    congressional committee reports (officially called house and
    senate reports) in the legislative process stems from their
    inseparable link to congressional bills. as retrospective
    documents, they present a concise pre-legislative history of
    issues and a legislative history of bills. as prospective
    documents, they explain the purposes and provisions of intended
    measures so as to maximise potential support.
