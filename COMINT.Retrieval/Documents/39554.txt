refraction of very high frequency radio signals at
    ionospheric heights calculations relevant to the radio tracking
    of space vehicles show that refractive errors due to the
    troposphere rapidly decrease with increasing elevation angle
    while those due to the ionosphere initially increase the with
    elevation angle and then decrease gradually the elevation angle
    error is plotted for realistic models of the ionosphere and
    troposphere
