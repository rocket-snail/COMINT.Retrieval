the pulse transfer function and its application to
    sampling servo systems a method of analysis of sampling in a
    linear system is described which is based on a sequence
    transformation closely analogous to the laplace transform the
    pulse transfer function relates a sequence of samples at the
    output of the system to the input sequence of pulses producing
    it servo systems with a finite time delay in the feedback loop
    are particularly considered a list of transforms is provided in
    an appendix
