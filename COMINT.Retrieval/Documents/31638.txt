theory of the compensated delay line analysis based on an
    equivalent ladder network indicates that for a certain
    compensating capacitance a constant delay can be obtained over
    a predetermined frequency range calculations are made for
    compensating rectangular plate capacitors results are presented
    in a graph useful for design the results are in good agreement
    with those of kallmann of and others
