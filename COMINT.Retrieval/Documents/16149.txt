the use of automatic indexing for authority control.
    thesaurus-based automatic indexing and automatic authority
    control share common ground as word-matching processes. to
    demonstrate the resemblance, an experimental system utilising
    automatic indexing as its core process was implemented to
    perform authority control on a collection of bibliographic
    records. details of the system are given and results discussed.
    the benefits of exploiting the resemblance between the 2
    systems are examined.
