clustering in free-text data bases. defines clusters as
    sets of chemical compounds related by similar chemical
    structure and activity and applies heuristic clustering methods
    for text data to a data base describing chemical compounds with
    medical uses. concludes that consideration of multiple medical
    use clustering assures comprehensiveness and supplements any
    weakness of purely heuristic searching. the existence of the
    aforementioned chemical similarities permits the exploration of
    new or previously unreported uses of chemical compounds by
    computer manipulation of data.
