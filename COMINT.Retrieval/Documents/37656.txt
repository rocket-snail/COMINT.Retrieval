switching circuits using bidirectional nonlinear
    impedances a general review of circuit logic is developed for a
    bidirectional nonlinear switching element the design of pnp
    transistor driver sriver stages is considered a binary octal
    decoder circuit and a simple binary full adder circuit are
    discussed as examples
