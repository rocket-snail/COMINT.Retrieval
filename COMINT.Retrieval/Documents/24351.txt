voltage regulators using nonlinear elements a simple
    method of determining the parameters of circuits providing
    reference voltages working o into a constant load is described
    and is illustrated by calculations for arrangements using
    either a single element or a pair of the nonlinear resistors
    manufactured by the compagnie generale de tsf of power
    limitations restrict the field of application of this type of
    voltage regulator
