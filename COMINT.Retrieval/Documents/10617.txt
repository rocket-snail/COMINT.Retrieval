can we seriously believe in the interdependence of
    archives and records management in north america?. argues that
    the management of records and archives are 2 distinct
    occupations, and not 2 specialist branches of the archive
    profession. acknowledges the desirability of collaboration
    between the 2, and examines the contribution of each department
    to the other, but concludes that the attempt to annex the field
    of records management to archive administration is ultimately
    an attempt to create a modern image for the profession by
    importing european terminology inappropriate to the north
    american actuality.
