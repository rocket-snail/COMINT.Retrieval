space requirements of university libraries. the council
    for scientific information published its report on space
    requirements for university libraries in may 81. the report
    deals with 22 university libraries. in the 70s the total annual
    growth of shelf metres was about 3%. the council forecasts a
    growth of about 4% for the 80s. it does not think that the
    developments in microforms and computerised services will
    change the situation in the next 15 to 20 years. some of the
    council's recommendations are' shelf measurement for
    collections should be the following' open shelves 6.3 metres
    per sq metre; closed access 8 shelf metres per sq metre;
    storage 9.3 metres per sq metre; and stacks 19 metres per sq
    metre. a national cooperative storage library should be
    established. libraries should have more enclosed reading rooms
    and research rooms.
