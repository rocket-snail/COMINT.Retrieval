time-education-information: discussion needed so that the
    school library can function. conclusions from a scandinavian
    school librarians' conference held at leangkollen, norway, july
    80, included the school library's all-embracing function; the
    pre-eminence of danish school libraries in scandinavia; the
    need for norwegian authorities to carry out the intentions of
    the library act; and school libraries' important role in
    scandinavian cultural cooperation. topics included a forward
    view of the school's aims and curriculum; the challenge of
    supplying suitable education for each individual child in the
    1980s; the staffing question, teacher training being seen as
    more valuable than advanced library studies; the new term
    'media centre', aptly describing the true function of a school
    library; and fairy tales in education. the school library is an
    important aid towards learning other scandinavian languages at
    the earliest possible age. essentials in norway are: a
    sufficient allowance of time for the school librarian in the
    curriculum; adequate education for school librarians; and
    information and discussion on the norwegian school library
    system.
