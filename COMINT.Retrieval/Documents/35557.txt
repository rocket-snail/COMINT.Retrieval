archives and displaying the heritage. a paper delivered
    at the 9th annual congress of the quebec archivists
    association, which draws on communication theory to present a
    dynamic interpretation of the archivist's role in making the
    public aware of the values of the past. the elements
    constituting the past are defined, and the attitudes of the
    historian and the interpreter compared and contrasted; the
    communication process is then explained and illustrated; and a
    definition of interpretation derived and related to the
    exhibition of archival material. the role of the archivist as
    transmitter of the messages of the past to the public is then
    discussed in detail, clarifying the objectives which should be
    his priorities.
