secondary electron emission from single crystals of
    alkali halide compounds experiments were caried out which show
    that the dielectrics investigated differ from metals in respect
    of the dependence of the coefficient of secondary emission on
    the energy of the primary electrons and also in respect of the
    secondary electron energies which in this case are
    approximately uniform
