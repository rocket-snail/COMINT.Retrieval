cosmic radio sources observed at a survey has been made
    over most of the celestial sphere between declinations and
    using a narrow pencil beam discrete sources giving flux
    densities of about were identified including which may not have
    been previously reported nearly all the discrete sources are
    associated with irregularities of the background
