resonance transitions induced by perturbations at two or
    more different frequencies expressions are derived for the
    alteration of magnetic resonance frequency due to the presence
    of a second oscillation at a nonresonance frequency
    applications of the formulae to nuclear resonance and molecular
    beam experiments are discussed
