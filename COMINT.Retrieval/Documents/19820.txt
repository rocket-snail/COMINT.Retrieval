on the possible relation of galactic radio noise to
    cosmic rays the possibility is considered that cosmic rays are
    accelerated in regions of the galaxy with intermediate particle
    density cm a conservative estimate of the magnetic fields in
    such regions would lead to a radio noise flux of the observed
    order of magnitude the observed spectrum could easily be
    produced
