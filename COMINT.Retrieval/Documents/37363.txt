in line to get on line. in jan 80, an ad hoc consortium
    of some 30 small to medium-sized college and university
    libraries was formed to investigate the development of a
    replicatable on-line public access catalogue. the group, condoc
    (consortium to develop an on-line catalog), came into existence
    because many smaller academic libraries saw their on-line
    catalogue requirements as different to those of large research
    libraries. condoc allowed the pooling of expertise. its 1st
    meeting took place at the american library association
    midwinter meeting, 1980. describes its work to date.
