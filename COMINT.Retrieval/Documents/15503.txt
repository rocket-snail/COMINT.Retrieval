a survey of the limits in dc amplification the effect of
    a change of the cathode temperature of planar dioe and triodes
    is calculated and the possibility of compensating this
    temperature effect is discussed the effect of anode voltage
    changes is analysed and some new compensating circuits are
    described which enable dynamic and in phase balance to be
    obtained simultaneously with a single adjustment for all
    balanced circuits the requirements as regards stability of the
    supply or auxiliary voltage are found to be nearly the same
    changes of valve constants with time are discussed
    investigation showed that the poorly defined position of the
    heater in the cathode sleeve of some valves seriously limited
    their stability
