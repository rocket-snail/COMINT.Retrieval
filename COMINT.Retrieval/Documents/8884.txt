brillouin flow with thermal velocities a type of electron
    flow in a constant magnetic field is described the beam of
    electrons is supposed to be everywhere in thermal equilibrium
    and the usual brillouin flow is found when the equilibrium
    temperature tends to zero some considerations are put forward
    bearing on the choice of a suitable beam temperature in
    specific problems
