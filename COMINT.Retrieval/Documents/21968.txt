diffraction of an electromagnetic plane wave by a
    metallic sheet a new generalized technique is developed for the
    o solution of the problem of the diffraction of an e polarized
    plane wave incident at an oblique angle on an imperfectly
    conducting half plane the solution obtained shows complete
    agreement with that of senior
