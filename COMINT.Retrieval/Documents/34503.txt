integro differential equations and babinets principle for
    plane screens with directional conductivity analysis is
    presented for diffraction by screens formed of parallel
    conducting wires four cases are distinguished a finite parallel
    wire screen alone nondirectionally conducting screen surrounded
    by an infinite parallel wire screen cases and are complementary
    in the sense of babinets principle so also are cases and there
    is no special relation between cases and or and
