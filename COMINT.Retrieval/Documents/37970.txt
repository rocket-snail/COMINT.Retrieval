the combined use of bibliographic coupling and cocitation
    for document retrieval. a linkage similarity measure which
    takes into account both the bibliographic coupling of documents
    and their cocitations (both cited and citing papers) produced
    improved document retrieval over a measure based only on
    bibliographic coupling. the test collection consisted of 1,712
    papers whose relevance to specific queries had been judged by
    users. overall, the change from the bibliographic coupling
    measure to the linkage similarity measure, representing the
    introduction of cocitation data, resulted in better retrieval
    performance.
