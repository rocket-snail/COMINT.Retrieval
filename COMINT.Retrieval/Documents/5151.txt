a broad band coaxial stark cell for microwave
    spectroscopy the cell consists of a coaxial structure long the
    outer conductor being of brass tube and the inner of brass rod
    the ends are vacuum sealed only a single wave transmission mode
    is possible in the operation range the application of a voltage
    between the conductors at some predetermined repetition rate
    modifies the variation of the absorption with the frequency of
    the rf wave field thus facilitating detection of resonance see
