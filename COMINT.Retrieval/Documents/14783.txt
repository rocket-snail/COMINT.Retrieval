hall effect modulators and gyrators employing magnetic
    field independent orientations in germanium the application of
    the hall effect in ge to the measurement of magnetic flux has
    been described previously of pearson further applications are
    now described to a product modulator in which the current
    corresponding to one signal is passed through the ge crystal
    while that corresponding to the other is used to produce the
    magnetic field and a circuit element with non reciprocal
    transmission properties or gyrator in these applications a
    crystal orientation is used for which the transverse
    magnetoresistance effects are zero and the variation of the
    hall effect coefficient with flux up to gauss is the
    experimental determination of this orientation is
    described
