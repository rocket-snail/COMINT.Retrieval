electromagnetic heating of thin layers of conductors or
    semiconductors generalizations relating to the problem of the
    determination of the ideal thickness formulae are quoted for
    the thickness of a cylindrical and of a spherical metal shell
    to make optimum use of the heating effect of a hf magnetic
    field if the metal is replaced by a material which is both a
    conductor and a dielectric the corresponding expressions are
    quite different though the ratio between them is the sam
    consideration is also given to the case of a cylindrical shell
    rotated rapidly in a uniform constant transverse magnetic
    field
