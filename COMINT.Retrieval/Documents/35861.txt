report of the premises committee-main points from bodies
    who have expressed opinions on the report. the report of the
    norwegian national library office's committee on library
    premises (feb 80) was circulated to municipal and county
    libraries, library associations and other interested bodies.
    there is general satisfaction with its principles and
    recommendations. suggestions for improvement concerned more
    concrete proposals for outreach and catalogue departments;
    larger minimum areas for periodicals, reading places and youth
    libraries; the addition of office accommodation, audio-visual
    equipment and separate study accommodation as obligatory; the
    relationship between a 'recommended' level of provision and the
    lower 'approved' level; recognition of the danger of closing
    small branches without providing a satisfactory alternative
    such as mobile libraries; a more positive attitude to
    'combination libraries'; queries on the standards for larger
    libraries; the status of the present temporary s tandards; and
    the desirability of further proposals on standards for opening
    hours and staffing.
