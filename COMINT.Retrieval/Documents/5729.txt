evaluation of an information retrieval system for
    assessment of toxicological effects of chemicals on fish,
    wildlife and ecosystem components. a user-oriented information
    retrieval system is needed for assessment of materials
    hazardous to fish, wildlife, food chain organisms, and other
    organisms essential to the maintenance of ecosystem processes
    and functions. critical evaluation of data also requires
    rigorous documentation of test conditions, precision of methods
    used, and the sensitivity of the test organism. particular
    emphasis of the evaluation was in developing practical criteria
    that aid in the use and interpretation of data with respect to
    need for further testing in a scoring exercise performed for
    the toxic substances control act interagency testing committee.
    recommendations are made for the integration of information on
    physical and chemical properties, health effects,
    ecotoxicology, and environmental concentration or exposure
    level.
