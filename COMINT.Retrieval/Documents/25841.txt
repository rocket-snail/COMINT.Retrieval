on a change in geomagnetic declination accompanying
    intense sporadic e layer ionization analysis of geomagnetic and
    ionospheric data obtained at kakioka and kokubunji respectively
    indicate that the geomagnetic declination exhibits increased
    diurnal variation a few hours after the appearance of an
    intense e layer it is inferred that the e layer ionization is
    probably due to the incidence of particles
