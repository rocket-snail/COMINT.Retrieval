scintillation of radio stars during aurorae and magnetic
    storms during aurorae the rate of scintillation is four times
    that during normal conditions probably as a consequence of a
    fourfold increase in the drift speed of the ionosphere
    irregularities causing the scintillations more generally the
    scintillation rate and the speed of the ionosphere
    irregularities are approximately proportional to the k index of
    geomagnetic activity
