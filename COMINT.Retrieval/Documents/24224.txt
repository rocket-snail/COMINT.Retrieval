the value of controlled indexing systems in online text
    databases. while the value of controlled indexing to supplement
    text searching is recognised in limited text (e.g.
    bibliographic) data bases, text searching is usually thought to
    give sufficient subject access to full text data bases.
    arguments drawn from information science, cognitive science and
    linguistics are put forward in favour of using some form of
    controlled language in full text data bases. the implementation
    of such a system in martindex, a full text drug information
    data bank, is briefly described. possible future improvements
    in subject access are also considered.
