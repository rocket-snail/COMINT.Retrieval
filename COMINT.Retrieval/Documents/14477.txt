videa amplifiers using alloy junction transistors
    grounded emitter video amplifier stages are analysed
    theoretically using compensated and uncompensated circuits
    abacs and charts are given to facilitate design procedure for
    multistage amplifiers together with the practical design of an
    amplifier with gain and bandwidth
