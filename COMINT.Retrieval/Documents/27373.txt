frequency control of short wave oscillators by means of
    an electrodeless gas discharge continuation of investigations
    reported previously with lower oscillator power higher gas
    pressure and looser feed back coupling a characteristic of
    quite different type is obtained giving a rapid decrease of
    frequeecy with increase of anode voltage over a narrow
    range
