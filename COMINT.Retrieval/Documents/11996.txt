electron emission from metals as an after effect of
    irradiation the emission of electrons from metals was measured
    after irradiation with x rays ultraviolet rays and visible rays
    and after glow discharge had taken effect the dependence of the
    secondary emission on the wavelength of the incident radiation
    and on the structure of the metal surface was investigated the
    time and temperature relation is independent of the manner of
    excitation which may even be produced by mechanical means the
    magnitude of the secondary emission depends on the state of
    oxidation of the surface it is further discussed how far the
    secondary emission depends on the nature of the metal or the
    nature of the surrounding gas the work function of electrons
    after irradiation is also considered
