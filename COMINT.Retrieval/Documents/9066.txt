the cultural policy of local authorities. the text of a
    talk given to a conference on libraries in the icy wind of
    cultural policy, held in jarfalla, may 81. in order to
    influence cultural policy the cultural producers must inform
    themselves of the whole sphere of local politics. local
    authorities have no legal obligation to provide cultural
    activities and legislation laying down minimum standards for
    such activities, as in finland, should be enacted. after the
    boom in the 60s and 70s, the local authorities have to make
    cuts; as they cannot reduce previous capital investment they
    cut current expenditure on cultural activities such as schools
    and libraries, although money seems always available for sport,
    bureaucracy and data technology. the real power of
    decision-making lies not with the cultural, but with the
    executive committee, who is responsible for budgeting. cultural
    consumers should be as politically active as the pressure
    groups for sport and try to influence local politicians, if a
    catastrophe for culture is to be averted.
