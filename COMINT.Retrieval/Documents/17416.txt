interactive monitoring of computer-based group
    communication. paper p-71. the interactive monitoring of group
    communication through computers is a procedure analogous to
    biofeedback, and small group communication computer programs
    have been developed to evaluate the impact of the medium on
    group communication. there is presently no technical reason
    that such information could not be made available to users of
    computer conferencing. an interactive monitor would allow the
    group to spot possible communication barriers and then
    determine proper interventions to reduce the barriers, thus
    providing an evaluation and alteration mechanism. report not
