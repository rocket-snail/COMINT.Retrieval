crystal frequency multipliers for centimetre and
    millimetre waves circuits are described for generating
    harmonics at frequencies using crystals the generator is
    coupled by a cross bar transition to the crystal which can be
    shifted axially for purposes of impedance matching higher
    frequencies can be achieved by use of crystals in a similar
    arrangement
