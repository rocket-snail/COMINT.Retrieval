pulse relaxation amplifier a low level magnetic amplifier
    the principles of operation are explained linear amplification
    can be obtained for an input signal of in a amplifier
    delivering an output of variation of the temperature between
    ans of the supply voltage by resulted in a maximum zero drift
    of less than over a two week period the gain varied by change
    of the supply frequency
