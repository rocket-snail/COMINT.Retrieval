on the question of quantum effects in the interaction of
    electrons with high frequency fields in resonators it is shown
    that the quantum effect corresponds to the interaction of
    electrons with a neutral oscillatory field in the resonator
    methods of quantum mechanics are avoided by using the nyquist
    formula
