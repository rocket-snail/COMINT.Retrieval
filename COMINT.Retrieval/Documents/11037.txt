how do libraries catalogue. the working group on
    cataloguing in public libraries surveyed the finnish public
    library system to find out about cataloguing methods in public
    libraries. 461 questionnaires were sent and 409 were returned.
    the working group is designing a computerised cataloguing
    system for public libraries. just over 70% of the respondents
    use finnish cataloguing rules. just under 50% of the
    respondents use their own subject indexing and nearly 87% of
    the respondents use the 1975 edition of the finnish
    classification scheme based on dewey. over 50% use the
    centralised cataloguing service of kirjastopalvelu oy, and
    nearly 60% of the responding library authorities undertake
    centralised cataloguing.
