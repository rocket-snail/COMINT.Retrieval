the information user in the construction industry-a study
    of the educational need and provision. there is ample record
    that information handling occupies a high percentage of
    production time and that poor performance in this field is at
    the root of many of the industry's problems. such problems fall
    into 2 main categories. the 1st relates to buildings themselves
    and concerns physical (collapse, fire, leaks, condensation) and
    spatial (short life, tight fit, high energy) failure. the 2nd
    category concerns organisational failures. clearly improvements
    in both these categories could be beneficial.
