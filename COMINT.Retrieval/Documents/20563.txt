electromagnetic waves emitted on detonation of explosives
    small electrical disturbances detected incidentally while using
    explosives to produce sharp stress pulses were later
    investigated separately the effect was displayed on a high
    speed cro the potential of a wire probe reached a maximum after
    about and then decayed to zero the effect is probably due to
    the production of positive and negative ions having different
    mobilities
