the network synthesis on the insertion loss basis methods
    of synthesis of most important network functions are derived in
    terms of the steady state network performance realization
    procedures are explained and expressed in explicit formulae for
    direct application to the design of conventional ladder
    structures with an arbitrary number of branches the symmetrical
    and the inverse impedance low pass networks are solved in
