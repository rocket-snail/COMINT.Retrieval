electroacoustic coupling at the boundary of an ionized
    medium an analysis is developed to explain the production of a
    reflected sound wave and a transmitted modified sound wave at
    the boundary of an ionized medium when an em wave is incident
    at the boundary in the presence of a transverse magnetic
    field
