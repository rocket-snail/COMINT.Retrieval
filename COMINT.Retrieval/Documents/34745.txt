centralised district system of acquisition. in slovak
    public libraries 3 modes of acquisitions are practised at
    present' the individual one, in which every library tries to
    satisfy its users' needs from its own stock; combined mode in
    which the district library provides some libraries in the
    district with literature; total centralisation of acquisition,
    practised by 17 district libraries. the latter is the most
    rational means of acquisition on condition that the literature
    is processed in 1 centre and that a collective catalogue is
    kept. each central library must formulate its acquisition
    policy taking into consideration the requirements of
    readers/users of the individual libraries.
