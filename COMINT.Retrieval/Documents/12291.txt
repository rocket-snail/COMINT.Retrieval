review of industrial of heat transfer to electronics
    techniques for controlling the temperature conditions of
    operation of electronic equipment are reviewed with particular
    reference to conditions in fast aircraft and missiles
    particular examples discussed are an air cooled valve cold
    plate techniques for cooling miniature and subminiature
    equipment valves designed for operation at surface temperatures
    near evaporation cooling of miniature transformers by means of
    fluorochemicals the importance of the subject of heat transfer
    to designers of electronic equipment is stressed and training
    programs at the massachusetts institute of technology are
    mentioned
