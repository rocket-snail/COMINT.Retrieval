on the geometry of radio reflections from aurora the
    observed characteristics of auroral radar echoes are explained
    by assuming that echoes arise by means of volume scattering
    from configurations of ionization similar to those observed
    visually the importance of allowing for the radar pulse length
    and aerial beam width is stressed
