data handling for science and technology' an overview and
    sourcebook. a guidebook concerned with publishing numerical
    scientific data, gaining access to it and ascertaining its
    reliability. it is aimed at producers and users of data as well
    as information specialists increasingly called upon to provide
    numerical data to scientific users. papers cover aspects of the
    generation, publishing, abstracting, collection, evaluation,
    repackaging, dissemination and application of data. in the
    physical sciences data are usually sufficiently well defined to
    be clearly separable from interpretation but this is not the
    case with biological and geological sciences so special
    attention is given to data handling in these subjects.
