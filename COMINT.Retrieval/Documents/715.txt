testing and revision of guidelines for writing abstracts
    of papers in the biological sciences. guidelines resulting from
    a previous british library project were tested in practice with
    the cooperation of 12 journal editors in the biological field.
    during the trial editors asked authors to use the proposed
    guidelines when amending abstracts of papers returned for
    revision. length, quality (particularly information content)
    and style were compared in 89 original and revised abstracts.
    the revised abstracts showed that the guidelines were of value
    in helping authors to revise abstracts.
