the most elementary geometrical representation of loss
    free linear quadripoles it is possible to describe impedance
    transformations in lossless and linear quadripoles by
    geometrical quantities and by cascade parameters an unambiguous
    geometrical representation in the form of a system of two
    transformation lines equivalent to the one transformation line
    of an impedance transformation is also possible and this leads
    to a new and unified method of representing the three different
    transformations by linear quadripoles and by elliptical and
    hyperbolic quadripoles as well as by the parabolic reactance
    quadripole this gives for the linear quadripoles an intuitive
    and elementary form of treatment which has proved to be very
    useful for the solution of many quadripole problems an
    impedance transformation using the images with respect to two
    transformation lines is given for the example of a parabolic
    reactance quadripole such as a series capacity
