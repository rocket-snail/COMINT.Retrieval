admittance and transfer function of a multimesh
    resistance capacitance filter network the impedance function of
    an n mesh rc network is expressed as a recurring continued
    fraction which is then resolved into the quotient of two
    polynomials the admittance function being the reciprocal of
    this quotient the transfer function is then determined the
    corresponding formulae for an n mesh cr network are
    derived
