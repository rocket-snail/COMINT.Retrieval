on the problem of brownian motion of nonlinear systems a
    kinetic derivation is given of the spectral noise intensity in
    firstorder approximation and for relatively high frequencies
    for a nonlinear rc circuit consisting of an idealized diode
    valve in thermal equilibrium and a capacitor the discrepancy
    with the rusults obtained by macdonald
