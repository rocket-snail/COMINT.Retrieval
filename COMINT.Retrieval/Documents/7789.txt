an easily applied method for the reduction of hf records
    to nh profiles including the effects of the earths magnetic
    field the method depends on sampling h at fixed submultiples of
    the frequencies at which true heights are required the latt r
    are then obtained by averaging the values of h a complete
    computation is presented for washington dc and the results
    checked against an analysis of curves for known profiles
