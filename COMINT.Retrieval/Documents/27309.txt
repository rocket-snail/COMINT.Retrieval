the government library as a community resource. the
    consumer information centre of the ministry of consumer and
    commercial relations is providing services and programmes to
    encourage the development and use of community-based consumer
    information services and resources. by working with existing
    networks of information suppliers, the centre seeks to minimise
    duplication of effort and to maximise access to consumer
    information. specific strategies are discussed which may have
    application to other government libraries and to those with
    responsibilities to multiple client groups which are
    geographically remote.
