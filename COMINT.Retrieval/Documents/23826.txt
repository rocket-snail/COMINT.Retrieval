the later development of christ church library, oxford.
    books were first transferred to the new christ church library
    building in peckwater quadrangle in the period 1763-70. the
    post of library keeper was filled by a senior member of the
    college. initially the library only served senior members of
    the college. in 1869 a library committee was established to
    oversee the purchase of books and the compiling and updating of
    catalogues. an undergraduate reading room was set up apart from
    the main building in 1884 and existed until 1929. problems
    arising from inefficiency and a lack of space gave rise to a
    major reorganisation of the library's resources in the 1930s.
    at the present time new accessions currently run to about 900
    volumes and 160 pamphlets per annum. all members of the college
    now have access to the library which has the best stock of
    research material in oxford, apart from the bodleian.
