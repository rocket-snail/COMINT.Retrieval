the asymmetry of two circuit tuned and coupled filters
    due to feedback via the grid anode capacitance the asymmetry
    due to feedback in the characteristics of an if amplifier is
    calculated for a circuit with tuned filters and for coupled
    filters the limiting conditions for instability are also
    determined see also below
