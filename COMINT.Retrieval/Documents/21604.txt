multiple feedback oscillators the use of several feedback
    circuits in connection with a single tank circuit makes it
    possible to construct oscillators capable of operation over a
    wide frequency range the lc value of the tank circuit remaining
    fixed such oscillators and the theory on which they are based
    are described by m morrison in usa patent no important points
    of the theory are here given and two typical oscillator
    circuits are described in the second of these a special current
    transformer with a ratio is used to effect phase alteration of
    the feedback current the transformer with a variable capacitor
    across the output terminals is adjusted to provide feedback
    current in phase with the ac component of the anode load
    current so that the proper grid voltage angle is obtained for
    maintaining oscillation at the desired frequency
