the dual input parallel t network the frequency of
    maximum attenuation in this type of circuit is a function of
    the ratio of the two input voltages various potentiometer drive
    arrangements can be used for external tuning over a wide
    frequency range experimental results for a circuit with dual
    potentiometer input are in good agreement with theory
