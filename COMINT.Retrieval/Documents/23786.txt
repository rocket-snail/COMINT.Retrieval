geomagnetic field and ionospheric drift drift
    measurements at new delhi do not show the semi diurnal
    periodicity which would be expected if the drifts were in the
    form of lunar or solar tides some correlation with the magnetic
    index k is looked for but is not found except on disturbed days
    when the northward velocity of the north south component
    increases with increasing k
