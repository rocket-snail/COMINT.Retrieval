ettec n the dependence of the decay times of space
    charges by the static characteristic in intermittent discharges
    the validity of the hypothesis previously formulated has been
    investigated experimentally measured decay times depend on the
    external circuit associated with the discharge tube but the
    existence of an inherent decay time dependent only on the
    static characteristic of the tube is indicated an empirical
    method is developed for calculating decay times
