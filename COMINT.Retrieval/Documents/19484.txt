echostant matching a new method of matching image
    parameter filters with the type of impedance matching described
    better matching conditions are obtained and fewer reactance
    elements are required than with the use of double m derived
    image impedances the simulation of tchebycheff type insertion
    loss and the compensation of losses by ihis method are also
    considered
