the system is the solution' an approach to increased
    technical services productivity. in 1978, ontario's university
    of waterloo discovered a backlog of books in its cataloguing
    department after a cataloguing revision and the implementation
    of full marc coding. a new approach to coping with the backlog
    proved very successful. a 5-point procedure was followed' (1)
    evaluate present operation and various tasks; (2) analyse these
    tasks to detect non-productive areas or areas in need of
    improvement; (3) design a solution; (4) document the new
    procedures; and (5) implement the solution. the procedures
    highlighted the fact that more time was spent in finding
    catalogue copy than in any other task. when this time was cut
    down through the use of the marc distribution service of the
    national library, the system proved suitably streamlined to
    eliminate the backlog in the cataloguing department.
