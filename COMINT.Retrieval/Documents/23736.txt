an automatic telephone system employing magnetic drum
    memory the diad drum information assembler and dispatcher
    system is described a capacitive scanner acts as a commutator
    for conveying signals from subscribers sets to storage on
    magnetic drums these signals are combined with permanently
    stored information processed in accordance with built in
    programmes and used to control call switching circuits the
    technical feasibility of the system has been demonstrated by
    large scale laboratory experiments
