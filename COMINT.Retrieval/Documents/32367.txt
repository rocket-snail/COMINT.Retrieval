high speed analogue digital converter details are given
    of a fully transistorized unit for the conversion of pulse
    amplitude data to numbers of pulses use is made of a tunnel
    diode transistor combination in the blocking oscillator circuit
    to produce oscillations at a frequency of or mc the overall
    dead time of the converter is reduced by times
