archival education and training in the united states,
    1937 to present. from almost its inception in 1937, archival
    education and training has been primarily a post-employment
    effort. this is attributed to the indifference of the
    professional associations in both the fields of librarianship
    and history, the 2 main disciplines from which manuscript
    librarians and archivists are drawn. between 1937-40 and
    1967-70, the american library association became peripherally
    interested. the history profession has become more active since
    the early 1970s in its search for alternative careers for
    aspiring historians. individual library schools also have been
    offering archival management courses since the early 1960s
    particularly. by lacking academic status, the american
    literature in the archival field has also been underdeveloped,
    and this has contributed to the slowness in developing adequate
    intellectual control of archival/manuscript sources. an attempt
    in 1967-70 to develop an archival manual withi n a.l.a. died
    aborning and the historical associations and society of
    american archivists have just begun to cope with the problem
    independently. practicing archivists of necessity will continue
    to be the main teacher pool and contributors to the literature
    until regular faculty in library schools and history
    departments have been adequately trained, but 1st a basic
    reorientation must occur that recognises that records and
    papers of contemporary society are the central problem.
