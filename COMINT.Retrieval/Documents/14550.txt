radio star scintillations and ionosphere the observed
    intensity at the surface of the earth of radiation at a
    frequency of from a radio star has been studied a relationship
    is shown to exist between the fluctuations of scintillations in
    this observed radiation intensity and the angle of its
    incidence on the level of the earths ionosphere the occurrence
    of these scintillations is compared with other ionospheric
    phenomena as determined by vertical soundings from the earth
    the probable cause of the fluctuations has been localized to a
    source in the high ionospheric regions
