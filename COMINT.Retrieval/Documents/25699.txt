study of high frequency fluctuations from light sources
    using phototubes and tuned radio frequency amplifiers
    observations have been made at frequencies up to using two
    different amplifiers for the ranges below and above the methods
    of connecting the photocell to the amplifiers are described the
    spatial distribution of some types of oscillation along the
    axis of vapour discharges was investigated attempts to observe
    fluctuations of light from the sun have been made only during
    quiet periods and have so far yielded negative results
