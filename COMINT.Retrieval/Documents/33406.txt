a frequency stable transistor audio oscillator of very
    simple design a circuit is described in which a point contact
    transistor maintains oscillations by supplying current pulses
    to a series circuit during half cycle periods when the emitter
    is conducting frequency stability is improved by including a
    diode in the emitter circuit
