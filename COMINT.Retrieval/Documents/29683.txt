a modified miller timebase circuit high linearity and
    rapid flyback are achieved by using a blocking oscillator to
    charge the feedback capacitor in the miller type circuit
    compensation is provided for variations in the blocking
    oscillator characteristics a unit giving sweep durations of
    with either triggered or continuous operation is
    described
