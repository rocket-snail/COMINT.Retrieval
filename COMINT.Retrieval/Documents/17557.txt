radioactive and photoelectric pn junction power sources
    an electrical power source can be made by exposing a pn
    junction to radioactivity or light so that the junction field
    separates electron hole pairs produced by the radiation
    expressions for maximum power optimum load resistance and
    efficiency are derived from an equivalent circuit and
    rectification theory power and efficiency increase with source
    current of separated charges and zeros bias junction resistance
    increases with energy and intensity of radiation but is limited
    by self absorption in the radioactive isotopes estimates of z
    attainable power and efficiency for silicon cells are watt cm
    and percent for solar radiation averaged allowing for night
    weather and varying angle of incidence and watt cm and percent
    for beta radiation from of activity curie g however lattice
    defects produced by beta radiation impair cell performance by
    increasing electron hole recombination a theoretical estimate
    of threshold energy for radiation damage in silicon is about
    about half the experimental value reported for germanium
    avoiding radiation damage by annealing by absorbers and by use
    of less energetic isotopes is discussed the y beta spectrum is
    given it is used in estimating damage rates in germanium which
    are high and efficiencies obtainable with absorbers which are
    low theory and experiment are compared for cells of silicon and
    of germanium
