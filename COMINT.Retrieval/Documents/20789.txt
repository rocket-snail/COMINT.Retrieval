subharmonic crystal oscillators the operating frequency
    of a relaxation oscillator can be stabilized at a submultiple
    of a crystal frequency in a conventional blocking oscillator
    with a crystal connected across the third winding of the pulse
    transformer frequency division by factors up to several
    thousand can be effected a multivibrator with crystal between
    anode and grid of one valve gave good frequency and pulse width
    stability when operating with a division factor of details of
    these two circuits are given three others have been examined
    namely a screen coupled phantastron a thyratron and a
    transistor circuit
