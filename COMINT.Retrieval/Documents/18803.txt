the maximum of the planck energy spectrum in the formula
    generally used for locating the maximum in the energy spectrum
    of a black body the spectral distribution is based on the
    amount of energy lying between two closely spaced wavelengths
    if the distribution is considered on a frequency basis instead
    of a wavelength basis a very diferent value is obtained for the
    position of the maximum for a body at roughly the temperature
    of the sun the maximum then falls which is outside the visible
    region re examination of plancks formula leads to a wien type
    law yielding a natural maximum fot the spectrum the location of
    this maximum does not alter on changing from a wavelength to a
    frequency basis
