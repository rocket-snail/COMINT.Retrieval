radio frequency observations of the solar eclipse of june
    radio frequency power received from the sun at wavelengths of
    and was measured during the solar eclipse of junce the sun was
    essentially free from active areas and the eclipse curves
    obtained have been used to derive models give predicted eclipse
    curves in good agreement with the observed ones comparison has
    been made with models derived by other investigators on the
    same wavelengths
