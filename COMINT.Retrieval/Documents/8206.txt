analysis of the dc characteristic of selenium rectifiers
    the method of analysis given permits the separation of the
    various physical phenomena in the rectification process an
    empirical equation for a limited section of the rectifier
    characteristic is derived the reduction of the slopof the
    logarithmic characteristic relative to the theoretical value is
    attributed to the effect of the contact of se with the n type
    intermediate layer of and
