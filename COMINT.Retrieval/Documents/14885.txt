businessmen try to stump librarians. san bernadino,
    california, chamber of commerce holds a weekly meeting, the
    koffee klatch, designed to give new chamber members a chance to
    talk about their business and to be a forum for programmes and
    speakers of interest. the city library's recent annual
    presentation comprised the usual updating programme plus a
    demonstration of the library's services-library staff gathered
    as many questions as possible at the beginning of the 1/2-hour
    presentation, took them to the library, and returned with
    answers before the presentation ended. the koffee klatch
    participants were astounded and impressed with the library's
    efforts and array of services. the result was a number of new
    library users and an enhanced library image.
