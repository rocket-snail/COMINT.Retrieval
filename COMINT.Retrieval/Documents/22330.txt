geomagnetic and ionospheric relationships the effect of a
    magnetic disturbance on various geomagnetic and ionospheric
    parameters is investigated by choosing days on which the sum is
    markedly different from that of the adjacent days most of the
    parameters show a peak or trough corresponding to that of the
    disturbance following it with a delay of hours particular
    attention is called to some peculiar seasonal effects to
    features of of the sporadic e layer at slough and the vertical
    movement of the f layer at huancayo
