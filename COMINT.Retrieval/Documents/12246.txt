experimental and theoretical investigation of a frequency
    stabilized transistor oscillator for the condition for
    oscillation of a feedback oscillator is derived the amplifier
    its load and the feedback network are treated as a single
    cascaded quadripole output voltage and frequency variations as
    a function of temperature load and supply voltage were measured
    on a practical circuit containing a quartz crystal resonator a
    general rule for adjusting the emitter series resistance so
    that the input parameters remain constant during variations of
    temperature could not be established
