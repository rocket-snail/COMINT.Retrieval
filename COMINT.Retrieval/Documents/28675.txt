foreign literature acquisitions in the swedish national
    library. paper presented at the 1st swedish-soviet seminar on
    'the national library within a country's library and
    information services' development prospects' held in moscow,
    21-22 nov 78. foreign literature acquisitions in the royal
    library reflect the library's 2 main functions, that of the
    swedish national library and stockholm's central library in the
    fields of humanities and social sciences. material acquired in
    keeping with the 1st function (suecana extranea) is divided
    into 4 sections-foreign translations of swedish writers' works,
    works in swedish published abroad, works on sweden and works of
    swedish nationals published abroad. exchanges of publications
    with libraries in other countries are an important factor in
    acquisitions especially with regard to the library's 2nd
    function.
