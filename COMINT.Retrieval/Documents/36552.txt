the enforced re-organization of industrial libraries.
    (fla thesis). considers the industrial library as part of a
    profit-motivated organisation, providing a literature and
    information service for the benefit of its parent company. the
    service provided must be integrated into the management and
    control structure of the company. as part of the organisation
    the library is subject to management control in the same way as
    any other part of the organisation. management decisions, made
    in a broader context than the library, affect the library's
    operation and its functions and staff. the effect of these
    decisions on the library are examined in a number of cases with
    particular emphasis on the policy decisions taken by ferranti
    ltd in 1975, and their effect on the company libraries.
