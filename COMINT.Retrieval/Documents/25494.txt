a wide band oscillator using a conical helix tuning
    inductor description of an oscillator working over a frequency
    range of and using a single tank circuit between the grid and
    the anode of a triode the tuning circuit consists of a variable
    inductor formed by two conical helices connected at their
    apices by a large capacitor and two variable cylindrical
    capacitors for the high frequency end the leads connecting the
    coils to the grid and the anode are used as transmission lines
    the main tuning circuit being automatically isolated methods of
    calculating the oscillation frequency in terms of the circuit
    parameters are described simplifying assumptions being mace a
    description is given of the design and performance of an
    experimental model for the range mcs
