dimensional analysis units and rationalization careless
    manipulation of dimensional formulae can lead to fallacious
    results the trouble is due to the use of the multiplication
    sign for two different kinds of products having very different
    physical meanings once these are clearly distinguished and the
    phsy physical meaning considered at every stage in the
    proceedings the diff culties encountered even with rationalized
    units are overcome
