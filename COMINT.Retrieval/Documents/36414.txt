a chemical approach to the treatment of electronic spin
    in semiconductors a method due to fowler in which the electrons
    and the neutral and ionized donors are treated as chemical
    entities affords a simple approach in the nondegenerate case
    the results obtained agree with those of landsberg of when the
    occurrence of neutral donors containing a unpaired and paired
    electrons is taken into account
