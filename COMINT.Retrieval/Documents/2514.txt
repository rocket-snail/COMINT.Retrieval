forced oscillations with nonlinear restoring force both
    transient and steady state oscillations are studied the
    original differential equation characterized by a nonlinear
    term is transformed to the following first order differential
    equation following poincare and bendixson the singularities and
    the integral curves of this equation are discussed the former
    being correlated with the steady states and the latter with the
    transient states of oscillation the integral curves yield the
    relation between the initial conditions and the steady state
    solutions fundamental and subharmonic oscillations of order are
    investigated the theoretical results are compared with
    measurements made on a circuit containing a saturable iron core
    satisfactory agreement is found
