inhomogeneous waves in the diffraction field near loss
    free dielectric circular cylinders measurements were made at of
    the diffraction field near solid and hollow dielectric
    cylinders of equal external diameter placed in a parallel plate
    transmission line results are compared with those obtained for
    a solid metal cylinder of equal diameter and with the field
    distribution given by a graphical method an explanation is
    given of the inhomogeneous waves which contribute to the
    measured diffraction field
