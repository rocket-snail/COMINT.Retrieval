the igy three frequency back scatter sounder the
    equipment consists of three transmitters operating at and each
    coupled to its own horizontal yagi aerial on a single rotating
    pole and by a tr switch to a receiver whose tuning is
    interlocked with the transmitter a camera records the plan
    position displays for the three frequencies together with a
    short range display preliminary results from stations in polar
    temperate and equatorial regions are discussed phenomena
    reported include sporadic e movements tilted f layer
    propagation large irregularities in the f layer and echoes from
    field aligned ionization
