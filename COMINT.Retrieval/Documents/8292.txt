a subsidiary layer in the e region of the ionosphere
    echoes from sporadic e can be distinguished from those from a
    layer at km height it is suggested that the ionization in this
    layer results from the impact of meteors on the atmosphere and
    that it may therefore be called the meteoric e layer the
    distinctive properties may be used to extend the use of the
    ionosphere for intermediate distance radio communication
