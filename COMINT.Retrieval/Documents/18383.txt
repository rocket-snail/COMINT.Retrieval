application of the soviet classification scheme in
    bulgaria's scientific libraries. since 1970, work has been in
    progress to gradually introduce the soviet classification
    scheme (referred to as bbk) into all types of libraries in
    bulgaria. the major responsibility for achieving this target
    has been that of the cyril and methodius national library in
    sofia supported by the national committee for culture and other
    bodies. the national library's staff have been principally
    involved in translating and editing the unabridged
    30-volume-bbk-version which has been published from 1973-81.
    the large scientific libraries will be catered for with this
    edition. public libraries, libraries in schools and others will
    be provided with abridged versions adapted for their special
    needs. various guide books, either translated from russian or
    written by bulgarian experts, will assist librarians to apply
    the bbk in the most effective way. an itemised account for
    introducing the bbk is given; it is emphasised, in particular,
    that the bbk is the only classification scheme based on
    marxism-leninism.
