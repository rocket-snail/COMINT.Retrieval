energy considerations for growth and decay transients in
    a simple resonator circuit analysis is presented for a series
    circuit values of current voltage being determined in terms of
    the characteristic resistance the solution of the differential
    equations is simplified by taking the energy of the circuit as
    the basic time variable since this is fixed by thinintial
    conditions
