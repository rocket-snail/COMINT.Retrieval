green library dedication address' the research library,
    an outpost of cultural continuity. delivered at the dedication
    of the east wing of the cecil h. green library, stanford
    university, california, 11 apr 80. in the 7th century, the
    venerable bede collected the major sources required for an
    understanding of his entire heritage and his obscure monastery
    at jarrow became an outpost of cultural continuity in an age of
    few such outposts. suggests that the green library may well
    become 'jarrow-on-the-pacific'. expands the analogy and urges
    the green library to repay the debt owed to bede by building a
    collection for posterity.
