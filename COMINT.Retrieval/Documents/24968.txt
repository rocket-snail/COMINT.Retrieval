thermodynamical consideration of equilibrium electrical
    fluctuations expressions are derived for the mean energy of
    electrical fluctuations in an lcr circuit maintained at a given
    temperature and for the spectral density of the fluctuation emf
    similar expressions published earlier by gorelik and ginzburg
    are discussed
