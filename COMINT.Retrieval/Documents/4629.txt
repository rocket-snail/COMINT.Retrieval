correlation between variations of surface pressure and
    ionospheric parameters a statistical analysis was made of
    meteorological and ionospheric data obtained at calcutta during
    the period of correlation between variations of ionosphere
    parameters and of surface pressure was found at least for some
    months of the year the results are in agreement with those
    obtained in australia by martyn ad pulley previously proposed
    tentative explanations based on variations of ozone content or
    the effects of circulation in the troposphere are examined
    further data are required in order to assess their
    correctness
