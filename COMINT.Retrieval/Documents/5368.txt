some current issues in planning for library automation at
    the state level. the connecticut automation coordinating
    committee (cacc) was formed in 1980 to provide an opportunity
    for all groups, libraries and organisations engaged in or
    interested in developing automated systems to meet regularly to
    share information and to begin an informal planning effort.
    discusses major issues that the cacc has faced which have
    implications for other states. a statewide on-line union
    catalogue is likely to consist of components developed
    independently by individual libraries or groups of libraries
    which have voluntarily adopted guidelines and standards
    suggested by the cacc. the role of the cacc is the
    identification of existing and emerging catalogues which might
    become components, the promotion of adequate access to those
    components and the assurance that there is a reasonable
    prospect of eventual linkage and integration of those
    components.
