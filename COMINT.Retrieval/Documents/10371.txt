an approximate method of obtaining the transient response
    from the frequency response the method is based on expressing
    the transient response in terms of the real part of the
    frequency response function which is plotted on a logarithmic
    frequency scale and approximated by a series of straight line
    segments a is calculated from the slopes of these
    segments
