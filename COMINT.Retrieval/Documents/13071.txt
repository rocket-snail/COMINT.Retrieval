preparation of specialized indexes and its necessities in
    reference services (in japanese). originally presented at the
    4th international congress on medical librarianship held in
    belgrade, yugoslavia, 2-5 sept 80. on-line literature retrieval
    services currently available in japan are jois, tool-ir,
    ideas/77, dialog, and orbit. general limitations associated
    with literature retrieval services are: (1) data bases do not
    cover certain primary sources; (2) secondary sources in the
    medical field such as igaku chuo zasshi and berichite &
    zentralblatter are not available on-line; (3) indexing of
    information is not exclusive, even if the primary source is
    covered by the data base. in order to compensate for these
    problems, the nippon medical school library produces index
    cards for special feature articles which are not easily
    retrieved, syndromes of diseases, and meetings held by
    societies without official publications.
