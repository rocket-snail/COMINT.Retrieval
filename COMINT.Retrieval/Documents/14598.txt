a theory of ferromagnetism a theory is formulated that
    when applied to iron making use only of spectroscopic data for
    the fe atom gives a value of bohr magnetons for the saturation
    magnetic moment per iron atom and a value of for the curie
    temperature these values are in reasonable agreement with the
    experimental values of magnetons and
