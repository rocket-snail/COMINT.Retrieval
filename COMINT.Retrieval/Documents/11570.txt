a hierarchical architecture for computer mail systems.
    presents an architectural model for large distributed computer
    mail systems. this model specifies' (1) a minimum set of
    functional components that supports all computer mail
    functions; (2) the functions and structure of each component;
    (3) the communication protocol needed for interprocess
    communication; and (4) the organisation of the identification
