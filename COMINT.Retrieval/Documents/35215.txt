technical report on linking the bibliographic utilities'
    benefits and costs. (report submitted to the us council on
    library resources.) presents the findings of an examination of
    the methods, benefits and costs of linking the 'bibliographic
    utilities', focusing on the following issues: (1) oclc,
    rlg/rlin, wln and the library of congress were considered
    initial candidates for linking; (2) attempts to determine the
    benefits for public and academic libraries of linking 2 or more
    utilities; (3) the analysis was restricted to bibliographic
    records for monographs; (4) assessed the impact of linking on
    shared cataloguing, interlibrary loan, and reference searching;
    (5) examined the benefits of the lc cataloguing function; and
    (6) the technical evaluation concentrated on link alternatives
    that are technologically feasible today and could be
    implemented within the next 3 or 4 years.
