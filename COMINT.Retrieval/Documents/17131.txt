on the design of rectifiers with electron stabilization
    the design of a stabilized rectifier should be divided into two
    stages calculation of the limits of stability of the limiting
    values of the mains voltage and load current for normal
    operation of the rectifier and determination of the coefficient
    of stability suitable methods for dealing with stage are
    proposed details of the calculation are set out and the case of
    the regulating valve with a shunt is discussed
    separately
