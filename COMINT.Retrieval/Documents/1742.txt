cross relaxation masers the ways in which ruby spinel
    rutile and emerald can amplify at frequencies small compared
    with their zero field splitting frequencies are surveyed cross
    relaxation is shown to give a two fold improvement in maser
    performance analytic expressions for the energies are
    given
