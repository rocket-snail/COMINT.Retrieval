contribution to the study of the operation of magnetic
    amplifiers the operation of a basic magnetic amplifier circuit
    is analysed assuming a square wave input and z rectangular
    hysteresis loop the area of which is increased due to eddy
    currents an equivalent circuit is derived that is applicable
    for the case of a periodic or continuous control signal
