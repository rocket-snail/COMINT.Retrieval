polarization of a molecular beam by an alternating field
    with variable amplitude and phase equations are derived and an
    exact solution is given for the case when the frequency of the
    applied field is the same as that of the molecular transition
    approximate solutions are obtained for slow and rapid
    variations in the amplitude and frequency of the field during
    the time of transit of the molecular beam through the resonator
    cavity
