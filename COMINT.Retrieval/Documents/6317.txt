plidos-an example of the use of microcomputers in
    information and documentation. plidos is a complete software
    system for the creation and operation of miniature data banks
    with a microcomputer, containing programmes for data recording,
    data bank construction and information retrieval. a prototype
    was tested at the hanover trades fair in 1980 and the test
    revealed a need for a system of this type. the manufacturers
    plan to offer also a plidos data bank service from 1981. plidos
    cannot compete with expensive data processing systems for large
    computers but it does offer users a chance to operate their own
    information and documentation system without running costs for
    computing time or data transmission. the category scheme is
    flexible enough to satisfy users' specific requirements. the
    search logic includes functions and and or and truncated search
    terms can be used.
