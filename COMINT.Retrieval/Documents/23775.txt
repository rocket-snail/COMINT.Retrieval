the influence of the copper raw material on the
    properties of copper oxide rectifiers the characteristics of
    rectifiers were investigated as a function of manufacturing
    conditions and degree of purity of the copper used results are
    tabulated and show that rectifier characteristics are
    considerably affected by the oxygen content of the
    copper
