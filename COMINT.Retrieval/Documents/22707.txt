some aspects of half wave magnetic amplifiers the
    performance of half wave magnetic amplifiers is analysed and a
    theory presented which allows for a finite control circuit
    resistance or rectifier reverse conductance and imperfect core
    properties experimental results obtained with amplifiers using
    different cores show good agreement with theory various methods
    of bias are reviewed and a conductance controlled amplifier is
    described
