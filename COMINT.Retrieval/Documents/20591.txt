passage of charged particles through plasma a
    phenomenological approach is used to examine the behaviour of a
    dispersive plasma and determine its response to an external
    disturbance in particular that created by a moving point charge
    the validity of this approach is discussed an analysis is made
    of the field and the polarization charge density produced by an
    incident particle and the effectiveness of the plasma in
    stopping the particle
