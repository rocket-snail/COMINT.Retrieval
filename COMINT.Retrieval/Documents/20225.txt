surface barrier transistor measurements and applications
    circuits for determining the transistor characteristics are
    described and examples of applications taking advantage of the
    high frequency cut off of the surface barrier transistor are
    given these include a two stage video amplifier for with
    measured power gain of at a crystal controlled oscillator
    delivering conversion gain from and a non saturating flip flop
    circuit with rise time and fall time
