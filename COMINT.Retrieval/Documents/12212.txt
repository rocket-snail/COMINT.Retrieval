a graphical contribution to the analysis and synthesis of
    electrical networks the contribution of the poles and zeros of
    a network function to the steady state characteristics at real
    frequencies is considered by means of vectors and the
    connection between attenuation and phase is thereby accentuated
    bodes relation between attenuation and phase in minimum phase
    networks is derived by considering the contributions from
    individual singularities and using a known definite integral in
    a real variable details are derived for the construction of a
    series of templates useful for finding pole zero positions
    which yield certain attenuation phase and delay characteristics
    and vice versa the method is illustrated by examples including
    the estimation of the phase and delay characteristics
    corresponding to the given attenuation characteristic of a
    minimum phase wide band amplifier
