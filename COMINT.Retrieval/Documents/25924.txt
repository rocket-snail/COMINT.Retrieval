design considerations for circulator maser systems a
    general expression for effective maser system noise temperature
    is calculated and a working approximation is derived the noise
    and stability requirements for a low noise circulator maser
    system are given in terms of maser gain and of dissipative
    losses and swr in various parts of the system
