university scientists as seekers of information' sources
    of references to books and their first use versus date of
    publication. questioning of social scientists and pure
    scientists/technologists revealed that the principal alerting
    agent for the former is the library, and for the latter, the
    selective dissemination of promotional materials and books by
    publishers and booksellers. analysis of 1st use versus age
    revealed that a book's interest potential depends upon several
    parameters' (1) user community (scientific field); (2)
    actuality; and (3) obsolescence' the rate of decay is dependent
    on source age.
