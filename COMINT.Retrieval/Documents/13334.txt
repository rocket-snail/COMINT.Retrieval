multiloop feedback amplifiers a stability criterion is
    derived which involves only one nyquist plot rational negative
    feedback and equalizer circuits or servomechanisms with
    prescribed characteristics the basic feedback amplifier circuit
    is examined with the object of determining the design of the
    transformation and feedback networks so as to obtain a given
    overall frequency response for a given response of the
    amplifier alone servomechanisms and equalizers are treated as
    particular cases
