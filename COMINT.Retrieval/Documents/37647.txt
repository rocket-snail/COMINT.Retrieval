some aspects of mixer crystal performance a method of
    calculating conversion loss and conductances of a crystal mixer
    is presented and their dependence on terminations at the image
    frequency and at the sum frequency is considered experimental
    data from various sources support the calculations graphs
    showing excess crystal noise versus output frequency and mixer
    noise temperature versus crystal noise temperature for varying
    conversion loss are derived and applied together with the
    conversion loss data to practical calculations of optimum mixer
    configuration and optimum if two examples are worked out
    experimental confirmation of results was obtained
