experimental band pass amplifier a description is given
    of the practical design of an amplifier circuit in which the
    bandwidth can be adjusted and the gain varied between wide
    limits without shifting the centre frequency of or affecting
    the response curve features of the design are the capacitive
    coupling of the tuned circuits the neutralization of the grid
    anode capacitance of a type pentode by means of a specially
    constructed plunger type capacitor and th compensation of valve
    input impedance variations by a suitable cathode load
