an exact formulation of bradford's law. an exact,
    discrete formulation of bradford's law describing the
    distribution of articles in journals is derived by showing that
    it is a special case of the zipf-mandelbrot 'rank frequency'
    law. a relatively simple method is presented for fitting the
    model to empirical data and estimating the number of journals
    and articles in a subject collection.
