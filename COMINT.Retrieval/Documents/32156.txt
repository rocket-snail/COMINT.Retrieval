    at graz technical university. the foundations for a technical
    university were laid in 1811 when archduke johann realised his
    plans for a scientific institution and donated his private
    collection, including books, to the province of steiermark, but
    it did not become a state institution until 1874 and a library,
    with its own building, budget and staff, was not established
    until 1889. the relationship between the academic staff and the
    library was always fraught with difficulties and full
    independence for the library was not achieved until 1960. brief
    biographies of the 8 library directors to date and a review of
    staffing and budgets up to 1975 are included.
