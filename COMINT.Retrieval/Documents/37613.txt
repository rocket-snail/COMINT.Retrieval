high frequency transistor amplifiers transistor high
    frequency transistor amplifiers transistor equivalent circuits
    appropriate for hf wide band operation are presented input and
    output impedance and power gain for grounded base and grounded
    emitter arrangements are discussed the design of an if
    amplifier using four npn transistors is described as an example
    the bandwidth is centred at and the gain is pr stage
