bibliographic standards and libraries. standardisation
    within the library and information community is defined and
    then considered in terms of support from and involvement of the
    community, factors causing standardisation, and problems
    encountered in the development of standards. concludes that
    there is a viable mechanism for the development of
    bibliographic standards, but that there is lacking not only a
    basic understanding of this mechanism and the importance of
    standards by the information community, but also the necessary
    commitment and involvement critical to successful
    standardisation.
