the electromagnetic transmission characteristics of the
    two dimensional lattice medium a theoretical investigation is
    made of systems with obstacles arranged to form a regular
    lattice in planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation
    the obstacles having elliptical cross section an examination is
    made of the influence of obstacle size shape and spacing and of
    the wave polarization on the transmission characteristics no
    restriction is introduced as regards the size of the obstacle
    in relation to the theory is relevant to problems of microwave
    lenses and transmission circuits of travelling wave
