towards establishment of compatibility between indexing
    languages. outlines previous work done in the field of
    compatibility between indexing languages (il), and describes
    the scope, limitations and advantages of establishing
    compatibility between il. suggests methods for verbal
    comparisons between il as well as generation of an alphabetical
    comparison matrix mi. conceptual comparisons however, demand a
    conceptual reorganisation of mi into a compatibility matrix m2
    with its two alternatives, namely a system-related matrix m3
    and a hierarchical matrix m4. describes the use of a
    compatibility matrix, and discusses some organisational
    problems.
