variations in the positive ion concentration with
    altitude from data of mass spectrometry measurements on the
    third satellite mass spectrometer measurements of the ion
    concentration are compared with measurements of electron
    concentration obtained from radio observations of the first and
    third soviet satellites and with measurements of positive ion
    concentration obtained with positive ion traps installed on the
    third soviet satellite
