official government publications and bibliographic work
    at the swedish parliamentary library. article presented at the
    annual meeting of ifla, general research council, 1981. briefly
    describes the history of the 2annual bibliography of swedish
    official publications1 which 1st appeared in 1934 covering the
    years 1931-33. it was followed by annual volumes compiled by
    the swedish parliamentary library which received a deposit copy
    of every printed official document. the 2annual bibliography1
    has always been produced in a conventional way. however an
    audit group is investigating whether it should be inserted into
    the libris system, used by swedish research libraries.
