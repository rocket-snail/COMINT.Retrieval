the school libraries and progressive educators: two
    points of view. a brief survey of the literature of the us
    progressive education movement, 1920-50, showing the
    ambivalence of progressive educators toward the school library.
    some of the foremost practitioners believed that the use of
    library resources could enrich and expand the nature of
    experience and 'learning by doing'; others were apparently
    indifferent or openly hostile to the concept of the school
    library.
