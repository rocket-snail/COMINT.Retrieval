libraries and educational broadcasting. contribution to
    an issue devoted to educational broadcasting and libraries.
    describes the links between renfrew district libraries and the
    bbc adult literacy project. in 1975, the scottish adult
    literacy agency awarded the libraries a *6500 grant to provide
    adult literacy materials, and bbc promotion materials were used
    to extend the library's services. the bbc showed great
    enthusiasm for the project and selected paisley as a venue for
    the roadshow programme-a successful venture, although it
    oversimplified the services and information provided by the
    libraries. libraries must respond to the interest generated by
    the media, by providing resources, study facilities, and
    professional skills required of librarians by individuals in an
    open learning situation.
