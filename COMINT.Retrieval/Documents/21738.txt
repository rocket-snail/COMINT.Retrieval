frequency stabilization of usw oscillators by using
    harmonics for the excitation of the quartz crystal modern
    methods of direct stabilization of d rect stabilization of usw
    oscillators by quartz crystals are reviewed circuits are
    described in which the static capacitance of the crystal is
    compenated by inductance simple bridge circuits for operation
    over a range of frequencies are also described in which the
    crystal is excited by high order harmonics uncompensated
    circuits are also considered and comparison is made between the
    various types of circuit
