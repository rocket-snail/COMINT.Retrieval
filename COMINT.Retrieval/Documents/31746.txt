the field due to an infinite dielectric cylinder between
    two parallel conducting planes if the cylinder radius b is
    sufficiently small compared with the other dimensions involved
    the change of capacitance due to its insertion between the
    plates can be made proportional to where k is the dielectric
    constant of the cylinder for a conducting cylinder k is put
    equal to infinity applications include the measurement of the
    departure from uniformity of threads
