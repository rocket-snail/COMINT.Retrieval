the reactance type straight amplifier as a low noise
    preamplifier stage in the uhf range the signal and noise
    response of a cascade connected amplifier is investigated which
    consists of a diode reactance preamplifier see of followed by a
    conventional triode amplifier results are given of measurements
    on an experimental circuit using a signal frequency of with
    pumping at
