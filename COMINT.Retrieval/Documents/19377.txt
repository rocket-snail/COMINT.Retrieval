the possibilities and limitations of local government
    development plans for libraries. lecture given at the annual
    conference of the association of librarians in public
    libraries, berlin 1980. the euphoria from library planning in
    the 1970s has now faded, leaving behind scepticism as to
    whether the plans can be carried out. library planning without
    a legal basis is not binding; the law should provide a legal
    framework, local authority planning the detailed description of
    concrete aims. planning stages are described with reference to
    the frankfurt-am-main library development plan of 1972. library
    planning is particularly important in times of financial
    difficulty; a local authority's financial capacity must be
    considered in order to avoid cost inflation. library plans can
    be regarded as pacemakers on the way to a better development of
    library services.
