bibliotheksdata has a plan. a statements by
    biblioteksdata on its past achievement and future plans. since
    1974, the library centre has been building up a data base of
    now 280,000 titles, invaluable for libraries in their stock
    registration. the experience from the automation of olstykke
    library will also benefit the future system. specifications for
    registration of materials, issue control and catalogues have
    been developed. a project consisting of modules which libraries
    can accept gradually has now been developed. the project is
    dependent on' computer registration of libraries' stock,
    decentralised input of data in own terminals, standardisation,
    gradual introduction of modules as they become ready, and
    locally determined selection of modules. the cataloguing module
    will be ready at the end of 1982, the issue and acquisitions
    modules during 1983. the beta module makes it possible to
    register a library's holdings of titles already in the library
    centre base. suppliers of hardware are to be chosen during
    spring 82; running costs can, therefore, not be calculated
    yet.
