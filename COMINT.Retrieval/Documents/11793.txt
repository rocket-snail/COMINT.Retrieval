the solar ray spectrum and the density of the upper
    atmosphere data derived from rocket experiments give a measure
    of the flux density of solar rays incident on the layer from
    the rate of ray absorption at heights between and the
    atmospheric density is computed to be about one third of the
    current rocket panel average values
