catalogues and a decentralised computer system1' swedish
    views on a danish report.d iscusses a report by a danish
    working party on catalogue products, published in 1980, and
    compares the danish and swedish solutions. the proposed danish
    system can be described as a mixture of libris and bums and
    considerable central guidance by the library centre is assumed.
    the working party seems to have little faith in the ability of
    individual libraries to catalogue according to the norms, for
    it proposes that central libraries help the smaller libraries
    with the decentralised input. the costs of this system are,
    however, high, and the swedish system, where the library
    service catalogues from photocopied title pages those titles
    not found in the central data base, is preferable. criticises
    the report for not carrying out economic costing of the
    implementation of the standard specifications. the report
    exaggerates the costs of producing local catalogues in printed
    form and neglects to consider use of modern technology, e.g.
    laser printers, for this production.
