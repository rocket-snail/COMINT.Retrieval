the reflection of electromagnetic waves at a plane metal
    surface covered with an absorbing layer the reflection
    coefficient is calculated as a function of for an em wave
    incident perpendicularly on a thin absorption layer numerical
    and graphical methods are given for the evaluation of layer
    parameters which make the reflection coefficient as small as
    possible over a wide range of
