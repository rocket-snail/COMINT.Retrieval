invisible colleges as a basis for planning special
    library services. a review of the literature. explains how
    invisible colleges facilitate transmission of information among
    members of scientific communities, citing published research as
    evidence. there is no evidence in the literature to show that
    librarians have capitalised on this phenomenon. proposes that
    information centres identify the interests of user communities
    and keep files on their activities, disseminating this
    information as part of their reference services.
