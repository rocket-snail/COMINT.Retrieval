the central library of zurich-irchel university. the
    library was founded in 1974, the new building opening in 1980.
    the library's main task is to provide students, mainly of
    philosophy and pre-clinical medicine, with a wide range of
    textbooks, reference works and basic literature in their own
    subjects and an introduction to the literature of other
    disciplines. the library cooperates actively with other
    libraries, organising the production of a union catalogue with
    other university institute libraries and participating in the
    direct ordering and supply service of the national technical
    university library. library stocks now total 4,000 books and
    300 current periodicals. the dobis/libis on-line system is used
    in the search for and input of information, accessions,
    cataloguing and loans. the library's most urgent tasks are
    expansion of stock and completion of the union
    catalogue.
