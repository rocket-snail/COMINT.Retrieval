community information in mobile libraries. the use of
    mobile information vans in the uk is growing mainly in urban
    areas, although it is in the rural areas that the dearth of
    information and advice is most acute. small vans offer clients
    little privacy and the national council for social services has
    recommended the use of large multipurpose vans such as
    travelling libraries. this has possibilities and an
    experimental library/information vehicle (a converted bus) is
    being tried in bradford. problems include lack of space,
    particularly where local geography necessitates small mobile
    libraries. in such cases, leaflets could be kept in the
    cab.
