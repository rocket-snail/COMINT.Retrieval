present status of inorganic chemical nomenclature. a
    systematic chemical name is one which portrays the essential
    structural features of a chemical compound by some general
    pattern. for most purposes it is unnecessary to write
    nomenclature rules in such detail as to provide a single name
    for each compound. like all human activities nomenclature
    patterns change with time. this is essential to meet new
    conditions, to secure greater generality, or to obtain simpler
    names. while nomenclature specialists must be attuned to the
    needs of nomenclature users, their suggested solutions to be
    successful must be acceptable to the users. the presentation
