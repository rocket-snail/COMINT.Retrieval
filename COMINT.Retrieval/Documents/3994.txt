the commercial circulating library in the 1970s. the
    hopes placed in the 'tuppenny' library in the 1930s were seen
    to be short-lived by the 1950s. circulating libraries are
    defined as those from which books were borrowed through
    subscription or small fees paid to the business concerns
    providing them. they were primarily for recreational reading,
    and agents included harrod's, boots and smaller shops. stock
    was bought or obtained through suppliers such as allied
    libraries in manchester, who declined in that part of their
    business, and closed it in 1975, and south county libraries who
    supplied to 6,000-7,000 agents after the war, and to less than
    150 in 1978. some agents were reluctant to close, because of
    customer relations, while younger shop owners were often
    uninterested.
