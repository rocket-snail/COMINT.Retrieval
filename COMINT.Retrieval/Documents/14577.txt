reference materials in a telephone reference service' a
    model for telereference. presents a description of a telephone
    reference service and the reference materials used in answering
    patrons' queries. the discussion focuses on the application of
    the experience of telephone reference librarians to the
    development of computerised systems such as telereference. it
    is suggested that selection of information sources to include
    data bases would be facilitated by an examination of reference
    materials currently used in ready-reference services.
