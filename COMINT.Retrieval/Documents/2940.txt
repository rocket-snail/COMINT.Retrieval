control of geomagnetic activity by sunspots statistical
    analysis of the sunspots observed in and shows that as regards
    their effect on geomagnetic activity they can be divided into
    two distinct classes radio emissive spots the source of
    relatively dense corpuscular jets and accompanied by marked
    peaks of mean geomagnetic activity sunspots with no corpuscular
    or a radio emission sunspots with no corpuscular or radio
    emission causing a marked reduction of geomagnetic activity in
    the case of many spots of this latter type the geomagnetic
    activity returns quickly to normal to days after the spots pass
    the central meridian
