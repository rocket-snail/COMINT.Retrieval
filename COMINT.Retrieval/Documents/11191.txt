electroluminescence excited by short field pulses an
    extension of a previous investigation is reported pulses of
    duration were used the luminescence decay rate is highest for
    the shortest pulses results are consistent with previous
    conclusions regarding polarization effects a threshold pulse
    duration of about is estimated to be necessary for the
    accumulation of polarization charges
