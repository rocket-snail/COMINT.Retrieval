library automation in australia' the state of the art.
    both the 14.5 million population and the distance which
    australia is from the major publishing centres may account for
    the enthusiasm for new technology. australian libraries were
    early users of microcomputers. a growth in the country's
    telecommunications has culminated in the introduction of midas
    in 79, and use of on-line data bases via lockheed, sdc and
    oclc. access to data bases within australia is now achieved
    through ausinet and csironet. this has promoted library
    automation, dealt with here in 3 phases' (1) relates to
    punched-card systems; (2) is characterised by the introduction
    of ausmarc in 71, and the australian marc record service; and
    (3) covers the shared systems and cooperative networks. briefly
    surveys the future which seems largely dependent on the success
    of the national library of australia's development programme
    for hardware and software to provide a nationwide
    service.
