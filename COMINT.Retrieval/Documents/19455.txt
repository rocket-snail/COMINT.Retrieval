library services for immigrants from the mediterranean
    countries' plans at utrecht public library. in 1981 a new post
    with special responsibility for services to foreign workers and
    their families was created at utrecht public library in the
    netherlands. utrecht has almost 20,000 immigrants, mainly from
    the poorer mediterranean countries and the new post was the
    result of a report published in 1980 on the provision of
    library services to immigrant workers. the report recognised
    the difficulties in providing such services and recommended
    enlisting the aid of immigrant workers in selecting, obtaining
    and processing material for the library. to publicise its
    services the library is endeavouring to contact local
    organisations concerned with the social and cultural welfare of
    immigrant families and to give presentations on the library's
    servives at meetings of immigrant workers.
