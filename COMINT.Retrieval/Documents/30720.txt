an alternate approach to cover materials for class 'a'
    library binding. describes research conducted by whitman
    products, ltd., rhode island, into alternate approaches to
    cover materials for class 'a' library binding (which is
    endorsed by the us library binding institute). class 'a' cover
    materials have previously been limited to group f buckram, but
    many non-woven substrates are available, including cellulose
    fibres reinforced with a synthetic resin in latex form. these
    have, however, been deficient in the book's spine area. whitman
    has worked with a type ii grade non-woven base with spine
    reinforcement using polyester scrims. it is felt that the new
    approach offers sufficient advantages to justify an effort by
    binderies and others to develop the equipment and techniques to
    make this a viable, profitable class 'a' library binding
    adhesive.
