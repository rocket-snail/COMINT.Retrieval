impedance transformations through lossless two ports
    represented by fractional linear transformations of the unit
    circle the automorphism of a unit circle corresponding to an
    impedance transformation is characterized by three parameters
    and can be represented by three successive elementary
    transformations this leads to a simple graphical method using
    caoter or smith charts for the determination of the transformed
    impedance and for the treatment of cascades of lossless two
    ports
