patron use of an online circulation system in known item
    searching. patron use of the university of illinois' on-line
    circulation system was studied by interviewing and observing
    sample patrons at public terminals. it was found that 56% of
    the 'original known-item searches' (searches in which the user
    had not obtained any information from the card catalogue) were
    successful-with 16% failing as a result of error in use-and
    that 86% of the 'location searches' (searches in which the user
    had obtained the call number of the item from the card
    catalogue and was looking for the location) were
    successful-with 8% failing as a result of error in use.
