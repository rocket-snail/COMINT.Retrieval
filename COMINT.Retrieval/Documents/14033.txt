the role of library cooperatives in an australian
    bibliographic network. reviews the implications of the
    australian bibliographic network (abn) for existing
    cooperatives such as clann and caval. the personal view of the
    author is that access to abn will enhance rather than diminish
    the long-term role of such cooperatives, although some
    rationalisation of autonomy and investment undertaken hitherto
    will be necessary.
