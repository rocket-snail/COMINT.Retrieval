charge and magnetic field interaction with satellites
    when satellite motion is parallel to a magnetic field the
    satellite will become negatively charged to a potential for
    motion perpendicular to the field this will be modified by an
    induced e m f which may be as large as per metre of satellite
    length the drag caused by induced currents is found to be
    negligible except for very large satellites
