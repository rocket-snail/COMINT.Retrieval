nonlinear phenomenological theory of plasma oscillations
    damped oscillations are shown to arise under certain conditions
    the intensity of the standing waves being augmented by
    collisions with a loss of efficiency in general increasing
    current and plasma temperature tend to promote oscillations
    while the role of plasma density is more complex the influence
    of a magnetic field in the limiting case of no damping is also
    investigated
