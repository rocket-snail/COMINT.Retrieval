auroral ionization and magnetic disturbances the
    literature on radio studies of the aurora the relation between
    aurora and magnetic storms and the movements of the ionosphere
    and auroral forms is co ordinated references an average density
    of electrons cm is sufficient to explain normal radar echoes
    magnetic disturbances are closely related to ionization and
    luminosity of the aurora magnetic variations are also
    associated with increases in the speeds of motion of the
    ionization
