high frequency crystal units for use in selective
    networks and their proposed application in filters suitable for
    mobile radio channel selection the design of bevelled at type
    quartz plates for use in band pass crystal units is described
    the reduction of unwanted modes of vibration including
    thickness shear overtone modes is considered approximate
