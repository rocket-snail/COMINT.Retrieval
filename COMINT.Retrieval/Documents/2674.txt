noise and electron temperatures of some cold cathode
    argon discharges noise temperatures at were compared with the
    corresponding electron temperatures for the positive columns of
    some cold cathode discharges in a they were found to be in
    close agreement the discharges gave reproducible results and
    are recommended for use as noise standards
