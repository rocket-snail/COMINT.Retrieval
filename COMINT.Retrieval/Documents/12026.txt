the role of the librarian in his field and the function
    of the public library. argues that public libraries should
    employ specialised personnel to expand library involvement in
    the cultural, social and economic development of the community.
    before 1960, librarians and libraries provided only limited
    services to a minority of users; with the availability of new
    technology and specialised training, the librarian must meet
    the challenge of responding to the information and
    documentation needs of all citizens, and combat the competition
    books face from other means of communication. outlines recent
    developments in libraries and the profession, and presents a
    view of the library in the coming decades as an agent in the
    promotion of reading, the dissemination of information, and
    socio-cultural change.
