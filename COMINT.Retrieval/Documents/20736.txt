the public library in france. its actual situation and
    future prospects. a comprehensive and critical survey arguing
    the urgent need to provide equal levels of service for both
    urban and rural users. in general, the public sees libraries as
    out of date, under-resourced, and unattractive, and is largely
    unaware of recent new developments because these are restricted
    to a few centres of excellence. the public library should
    provide free comprehensive services for all' describes these
    services in detail, as they relate to documentation and
    information, and cultural activities. the division of library
    services into urban and rural structures has resulted in
    inadequate services for country areas; instead, the system
    should be reorganised into a network pattern to equalise
    distribution of resources. criticisms of municipal libraries,
    central lending libraries, and the french public library
    service in general are summarised in an appended memorandum,
    and further illustrated by an analysis of the organisation of
    services in the cambrai region.
