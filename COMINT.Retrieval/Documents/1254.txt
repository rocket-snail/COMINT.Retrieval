the noise generated in a coil with a ferro magnetic core
    the discussion presented indicates that when there is no
    varying or alternating magnetization of the core the noise can
    be calculated from the nyquist formula provided that the
    resistance of the coil is measured using an alternating voltage
    of such magnitude that the magnetization process remains
    linear
