tunnel diode straight amplifier as low noise preamplifier
    stage for the uhf range the signal and noise characteristics
    are investigated of a conventional triode amplifier with a
    tunnel diode circuit as preamplifier stage and experimental
    results obtained at and are found to agree well with theory for
    similar investigations on a diode reactance preamplifier
