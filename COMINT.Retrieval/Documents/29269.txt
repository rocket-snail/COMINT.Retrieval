a reader's view of east asian catalogue automation.
    discusses whether automation is preferable for catalogues of
    chinese language materials in australia. presents a brief
    history of cataloguing and classification in china. the
    romanised catalogue in alphabetical order is most suited to
    automation but a supplementary character-based catalogue for
    large east asian holdings would help users more familiar with
    characters and with different pronunciations in different
    languages and dialects. suggests that librarians should hold
    back automation until an integrated system which can cope with
    both romanised and character data at a reasonable cost is
    developed and then aim for a centralised cataloguing system for
    all east asian materials throughout australia, possibly based
    on the national library of australia but with input from all
    libraries with east asian materials.
