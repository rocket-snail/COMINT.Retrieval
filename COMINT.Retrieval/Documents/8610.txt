analogue computer with stepping switch drive for the
    solution of algebraic equations of up to sixth degree the
    analogy used is that between a sinusoidal voltage and a complex
    quantity the representation of the polynomials is effected
    using feedback amplifiers as computing elements the zero points
    corresponding to the solutions are found automatically
