multipotentials of multipoles general theory is presented
    applicable equally to magnetic or dielectric multipoles every
    multipole is shown to be associated with a scalar or vector
    multipotential which has spherical symmetry from the equation
    of this multipotential the usual scalar potential can be
    obtained by successive derivations
