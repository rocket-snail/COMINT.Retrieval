a second contribution to the solution of the rukop
    problem re examination of the problem of the dynatron driven
    series circuit and the arc driven parallel circuit abstracts
    nyquists stability criterion is applied to the equivalent
    circuit and the necessary and sufficient conditions for
    excitation of oscillations are determined
