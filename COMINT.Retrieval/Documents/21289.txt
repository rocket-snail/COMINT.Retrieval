copyright and the new media. discusses the principles for
    the future structure of copyright which are embodied in the
    revision committee's report on proposed changes in that part of
    the copyright act which refers to private copying. the majority
    wish to see free copying in single copies for private use, but
    to restrict professional multiple copying. this restriction is
    particularly aimed at the new media' sound and videotapes,
    which have led to mass use. there has always been a conflict
    between the rights of copyright holders to economic profit from
    their works and the right of society to free enjoyment of
    cultural values. upholds the basic principle of the owner's
    sole right, but points to ways of solving copyright conflicts
    in a mass use situation via licence agreements. today, where
    technology has made collective exploitation of works of art
    possible it is natural to seek these agreements with
    organisations rather than individual artists. recommends that
    such licence agreements be concl uded, and that copyright
    holders organise themselves so as to ease the administration of
    agreements.
