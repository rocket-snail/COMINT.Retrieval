the library's administrative body: clear guidelines now!.
    the norwegian government envisages cultural committees as
    administering libraries. individual library committees may
    survive, but as exceptions and in conflict with official
    policy. the library sub-committee is unsatisfactory. a ministry
    of church and education document (1979) outlines division of
    responsibility between librarian and cultural administration.
    librarians must insist on several professional demands. if
    these stipulations are upheld, and guidelines drawn up with the
    support of library organisations, libraries may survive.
