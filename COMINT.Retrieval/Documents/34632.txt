zero stabilisation of directly coupled amplifiers details
    are given of circuits in which stability of a direct coupled
    amplifier is achieved by use of a second amplifier in s
    feedback arrangement the auxiliary amplifier is highly stable
    but has a low cut off frequency hence low frequency signals are
    pre amplified giving enhanced signal noise ratio at these
    frequencies for high frequency signals the auxiliary amplifier
    is by passed
