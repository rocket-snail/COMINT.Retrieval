the electrical and thermal conductivities of monovalent
    metals numerical calculations for the case of so sodium using
    the bardeen formula for the scattering cross section and
    blackmans value for a longitudinal b debye temperature agree
    better with observation than do the simple bloch expressions
    but there still remain discrepancies further x study of the
    scattering cross section function might remove these
