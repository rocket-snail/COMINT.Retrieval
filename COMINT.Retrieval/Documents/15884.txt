directory of energy and environment libraries and
    information centers in the metropolitan washington, d.c. area.
    the directory has been compiled by the subcommittee on energy
    & environment information of the committee on information
    hang-ups. recognising the lack of information on local
    libraries having an interest in energy and the environment, the
    subcommittee initiated the project to foster cooperation and
    interlibrary loan. detailed information on the resources,
    services and policies of each library and information centre
    has been provided to meet this goal.
