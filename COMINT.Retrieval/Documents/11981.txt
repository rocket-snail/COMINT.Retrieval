new era of the school of librarianship in bratislava. the
    school of librarianship in bratislava was founded in 1953,
    simultaneously with similar schools in prague and brno. after
    overcoming considerable difficulties of various kinds in the
    1st 10 years of its history, the school has concentrated in
    educating and training prospective non-graduate librarians and
    information scientists. so far about 3,000 students have
    completed their full-time or part-time courses. almost 90% of
    them work in libraries and in centres of scientific, technical
    and economic information. commencing in the academic year
    1984-85, new syllabuses will come into force. the courses
    offered will be full-time only. after 2 years with a common
    curriculum, students will take up either librarianship or
    information science for the remaining 2 years, when final
    examinations of a theoretical and practical nature will be
    held. the new project, worked out under the auspices of the
    research institute for vocational education and training in
    prague, will become a further step towards providing libraries
    and information centres with capable staff.
