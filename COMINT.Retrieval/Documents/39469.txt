the electron affinity of hydrogen in a microwave gas
    discharge experiments show that hydrogen in a microwave gas
    discharge is a much better electron captor than its calculated
    capture cross section would indicate giving de ionization times
    in t r switches comparable with those obtained with water
    vapour
