    libraries published in nauchnye i tekhnicheskie biblioteki sssr
    in the past and discusses the criteria which can be used for
    typisation of libraries. suggests that: (1) 'library
    activities' and not 'library types' should be used as the basis
    for scientific typisation of libraries; (2) a number of library
    science disciplines have developed within the framework of
    library science which are based on various differentiation and
    integration principles; (3) theories of special librarianship
    must be built on an analysis of the activities undertaken by
    special libraries and not on the 'types' of special libraries;
    (4) general library science represents the nucleus essential
    for further development of library science knowledge.
