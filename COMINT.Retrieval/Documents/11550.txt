multistage amplifier output impedance based on the result
    that the ratio of the net amplification to the parallel output
    impedance of a simple amplifier is the same with and without
    voltage feedback a simple expression is obtained relating the
    parallel output impedance to the amplifier constants for the
    multistage amplifier with overall feedback the design of an
    amplifier with a gain of and a parallel output impedance of is
    discussed briefly
