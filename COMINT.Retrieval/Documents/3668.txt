tuning of a rectangular parallelepiped cavity resonator
    with a circular metallic post a relation is derived between the
    resonance frequency and small displacements of a post
    projecting into the resonator using a perturbation formula due
    to slater of the calculation is carried out to the first order
    for a rectangular cavity operating in the mode the result is
    compared with a similar relation for a right circular cylinder
    whose length is varied by a plunger completely closing one
    end
