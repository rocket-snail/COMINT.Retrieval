why standards for command languages?. there are many
    reasons why the growth and spread in the use of on-line
    information retrieval systems has been less dramatic than might
    have been expected. one of the obstacles facing the user is the
    need to master many diverse user interfaces. several solutions
    are offered, yet, the only one which is really open at present
    is to decline to use all but 1 or 2 familiar systems, accepting
    that some potentially valuable information will be missed. the
    main alternatives seem to be the adoption of standards by
    system operators or the use of translating software somewhere
    between the user and the retrieval systems. with the advent of
    the microprocessor and the intelligent terminal, this latter
    alternative becomes more attractive and it may appear, at 1st
    sight, that the need for standards for command languages is
    therefore lessened, or even disappears totally. however,
    careful consideration of the possibilities offered leads to the
    conclusion that the adopti on of standards will be more rather
    than less important if much of the potential is to be
    realised.
