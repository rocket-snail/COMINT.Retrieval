dynamic measurements on piezoelectric resonators with
    very strong electromechanical coupling the equivalent circuit
    used as the basis of measurements on quartz crystals is not
    suitable in conditions of strong electro mechanical coupling
    such as exist in ferroelectric crystals at the curie point the
    complete equivalent circuit for longitudinal resonance in such
    conditions includes a number of parallel branches whose
    contributions to the total piezoelectric current correspond to
    the coefficients of a fourier representation of the oscillation
    mode results given by the theory are compared with observations
    of the oscillations of a rochelle salt resonator
