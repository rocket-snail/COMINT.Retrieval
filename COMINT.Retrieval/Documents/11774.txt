ion production rate in an atmosphere of exponentially
    rising temperature with height an expression is derived for the
    height distribution of the ion production rate assuming that
    temperature varies exponentially with height and also depends
    on the solar zenith distance results are similar to those of
    chapman for heights up to about in the f region the maximum
    rate of ion production and the height at which it occurs vary
    anomalously with solar zenith distance
