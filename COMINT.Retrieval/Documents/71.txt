third time lucky in putting patients first?. the (uk)
    national health service is to be reorganised in 1982 for the
    third time since the war. the 1974 concept of the health care
    district as a health care community is to be the starting point
    of the next reorganisation and many multi-district areas are to
    be split, amalgamated or regrouped. librarians have developed
    library services of the nhs as an information network, and much
    of the country is now covered by regional networks
    incorporating nhs and medical school libraries. the new
    district health authorities may disrupt or cut services
    altogether, nhs fails frequently to recognise the direct
    contribution of library services to quality health care, and
    some libraries could come under the administrators of
    individual hospitals, although both the library association and
    nhs regional librarians group advocate organisation on a
    district rather than an institutional basis. librarians must be
    seen to be contributing to health care and actively campaign
    for recognition within the nhs.
