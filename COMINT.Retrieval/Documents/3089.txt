the mechanism of electroluminescence part applications to
    the experimental facts theory previously developed of may is
    used to interpret observed phenomena including temperature and
    frequency effects fluctuations of brightness corresponding to
    field alternations initial rise of brightness and surface
    effects good crystallization abundance of luminescence centres
    and donor levels and absence of other defects are conditions
    favouring the production of electroluminescence various
    theories of the phenomenon are compared in an appendix
