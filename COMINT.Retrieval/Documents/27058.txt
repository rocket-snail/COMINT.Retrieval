on chandrasekhars theory of turbulence the theory has
    been generalized to the case of axisymmetric turbulence and
    eight differential equations in eight defining scalars of
    double and triple correlation tensors deduced two of these
    equations replace that of de karman and howarth in the theory
    of isotropic turbulence
