the effect of soft x rays from the solar corona on the
    formation of the normal ionospheric e layer a calculation has
    been made previously of the soft x rays from the solar corona
    vol the results are used to determine the height at which the
    radiation is absorbed and the number of electrons present at
    this height under equilibrium conditions the results agree well
    with observations of the normal e layer
