the selenium rectifier in digital computer circuits
    results are reported of an investigation of the birkbeck
    college computer with the object of replacing valves by more
    reliable elements where possible measurements indicate that
    diameter se disk rectifiers are suitable for use as shift
    diodes buffer isolators gating elements coincidence sensing
    units and decoding matrix elements in computers where the
    frequency of operation does not exceed
