revising the dewey music schedules' tradition vs.
    innovation. presents a statistical comparison of the music
    schedules of the dewey decimal classification and the library
    association's proposal for a total revision of these schedules.
    the analysis is based on the ability of each classification to
    serve the needs of library patrons using the shelf arrangement
    to retrieve scores for performance purposes. the basis of the
    comparison presented here is a random sample of 400
    chamber-music scores chosen from the 2british catalogue of
    music1. each classification is analysed for its strengths and
    weaknesses in terms of its ability to meet the needs of
    performers, and the classifications are then compared using
    standard statistical methods. concludes with a discussion of
    whether or not the library association's proposal is a proper
    vehicle for a phoenix treatment of ddc 780 and some of the
    consequences of including it in some future edition of
    ddc.
