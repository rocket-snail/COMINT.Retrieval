    approach to the design of a circulation system matches its
    approach to its other library automation services. it has been
    designed in a modular fashion to meet the needs of a particular
    library. the approach is to discuss with staff the library
    needs and requirements and from these to design a system which
    meets those needs at minimum cost. a circulation system has
    been operating successfully in a public library in europe for
    several months. the general system requirements, system
    elements, network, hardware, system facilities and other
    services are described in detail.
