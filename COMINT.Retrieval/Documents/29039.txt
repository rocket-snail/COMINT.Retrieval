diffusion of ions in a static f region the vertical
    diffusion of ions under the action of gravity and a rate of
    electron loss which decreases exponentially with height is
    shown to correspond to heat conduction in a rod with a heat
    source distribution and radiation from the lateral surface
    electron density is determined as a time periodic function of
    the height and is expressed in the form of an infinite
    series
