inferred temperature variations at the f peak the scale
    height at the f peak has been estimated using data on the total
    electron content of the ionosphere obtained from the faraday
    rotation of lunar radio echoes and data obtained from vertical
    incidence soundings the scale height varies with time probably
    as a result of temperature variations the observed scale
    heights are in good agreement with a model atmosphere based on
    rocket and satellite observations
