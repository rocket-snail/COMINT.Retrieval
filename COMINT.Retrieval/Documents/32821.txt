a search for information man. examines the notion of
    'information man' by analogy with 'economic man' and seeks to
    discover how the concept has been used implicitly in user
    studies and bibliometrics. the conclusion is reached that a
    primitive conception of information man is to be found in such
    studies and the reasons for this are examined. more
    sophisticated versions of information man are seen to be
    emerging from some recent work.
