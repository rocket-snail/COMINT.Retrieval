approximation errors in diode function generators errors
    resulting from fitting a piecewise linear function to a smooth
    curve are discussed in relation to analogue computor
    applications a simple integral based on best fis criteria will
    give the relation between number of segments and error and also
    the breakpoints between segments numerical results are given
    for typical functions
