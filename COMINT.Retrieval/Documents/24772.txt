a simplified form of the relativistic electromagnetic
    equations maxwells equations are expressed in the form of a
    single four vector density equation in which the field tensor
    has only three distinct complex components the number of
    equations is reduced but all the usual classical formulae may
    be obtained by separating the real and imaginary parts
