from research to practice. marginal notes on the results
    of the librarianship research programme for 1976-1980. the
    national council for librarianship and documentation formerly
    elaborated a middle-range research programme for hungarian
    libraries during 1976-80. this study assesses to what extent
    the programme has been carried out. the most active areas of
    development have been in the field of reading research and
    investigations preceding the introduction of mechanised
    information storage and retrieval systems. other areas of
    research have been in the collection development field and
    exploration of written documents of the hungarian culture.
    finally, the study makes proposals for translation or
    adaptation to hungarian circumstances of some fundamental
    reference books published abroad on librarianship and
    information science in order to synthesise current knowledge
    for practice and education.
