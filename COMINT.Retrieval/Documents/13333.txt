student information needs and library user education. a
    small group of polytechnic undergraduates were interviewed over
    a 6 week period in order to investigate their information needs
    and their approaches to meeting them. academic staff were then
    interviewed to discover their perception of the students'
    information requirements. the findings are summarised with
    particular reference to the role of libraries in solving the
    students' information needs. the relevance of the findings to
    the planning of library user education programmes are
    discussed.
