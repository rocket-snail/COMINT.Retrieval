on the auroral zone current analysis of eleven examples
    of auroral zone disturbance of the geomagnetic field in the
    second international polar year indicates that the height of
    the zone currents may be km or less the current intensity for
    moderate magnetic disturbances being of the order of a very
    large increase in the electron density of the d and e layers
    being thus indicated
