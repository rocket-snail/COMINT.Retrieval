the electrically short antenna as a probe for measuring
    free electron densities and collision frequencies in an ionized
    region the in integral equation method is used to obtain
    expressions for the admittance of an electrically short centre
    driven dipole or base driven monopole when immersed in a
    conducting dielectric the conductivity and permittivity of the
    medium can be calculated from measurements of the admittance of
    the aerial immersed in the medium and in air
