radar echoes from meteor trails under conditions of
    severe diffusion an expression is derived indicating that the
    power of the echo is proportional to and to where is the range
    for a given meteor velocity there is a critical height above
    which the effects of diffusion become serious a graph shows the
    critical height velocity curves for values of between
    and
