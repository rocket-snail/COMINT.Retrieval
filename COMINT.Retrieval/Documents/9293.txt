curvature induced error in the analysis of fading records
    curvature of lines of maximum amplitude in a radio field
    strength pattern drifting cross an array of three receivers can
    introduce an error into the estimate of the drift velocity but
    the error is expected to be large only infrequently the mean
    error is sm ller for an array of receivers at the corners of an
    equilateral triangle than for one at the corners of a right n
    angled triangle
