observations of whistling atmospherics at geomagnetically
    conjugate points comparison of records obtained at points in n
    america and the new zealand appear to confirm storeys theory
    that whistlers and swishes are produced as the atmospherics
    travel along the dispersive paths constituted by the
    geomagnetic flux lines between the northern and southern
    hemispheres
