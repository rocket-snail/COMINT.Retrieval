circulation versus photocopy: quid pro quo?. information
    thought necessary for assessing the potential impact of a
    limited journal circulation policy at the university of
    california, san francisco, included the effects on seating, on
    in-house photocopying, and on circulation. an initial one-week
    survey showed journal circulation to be 7% of the total, with
    journals issued during the past 5 years comprising 45% of the
    total. a survey of user photocopying practice suggested that
    circulation limited to journals over 5 years old might result
    in a 90% increase in photocopying, and circulation survey were
    used to predict a 45% decrease in circulation. results of
    implementing a limited circulation policy were a 41%
    circulation decrease and a 136% increase in photocopying.
    differences between prediction and results may be accounted for
    by the effect of duplicate copy subscriptions and by provision
    of convenient photocopy facilities.
