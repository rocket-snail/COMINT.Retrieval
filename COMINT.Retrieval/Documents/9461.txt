field dependent conductivity in nonuniform fields and its
    relation to electrical breakdown a method is given for
    calculating the resulting field distribution when the
    conductivity is a function of the field strength this is
    applied to a point plane electrode system in an amorphous solid
    with the assumption that the conductivity at low field
    strengths is electronic and that the conductivity at high field
    strengths is described by a relation due to frohlich the
    results show that for polymethylmethacry late with average
    fields of the order of the reduction in maximum field strength
    from that calculated for constant conductivity can be a factor
    of five or more the magnitude of the reduction depending on the
    degree of non uniformity of the field various other insulating
    materials are also discussed
