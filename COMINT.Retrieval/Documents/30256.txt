cubic spline solutions to fourth-order boundary value
    problems the cubic spline approximation to the fourth-order
    differential equation y''''+p(x)y''+q(x)y'+r(x)y=t(x) is shown
    to reduce to the solution of a five-term recurrence
    relationship. for some special cases the approximation is shown
    to be simply related to a finite difference representation with
    a local truncation error of order (y/720)delta^8. june, 1973
