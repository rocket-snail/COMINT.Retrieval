in conversation with the minister for culture, recreation
    and social affairs, hans de boer. text of an interview with
    hans de boer, minister for culture, recreation and social
    affairs in the netherlands. de boer firmly supports the new
    public services act which will decentralise running of the
    public services, including public libraries, from national to
    local government level. de boer believes that involvement of
    the local community in the running of these services is the
    best guarantee for improving the quality of the service. plans
    for extending the age limit for free public library membership
    from 16 to 18 years of age have been abandoned by de boer
    because of financial cutbacks in government support. the
    alternative, de boer believes, would have been a reduction in
    the standard of service.
