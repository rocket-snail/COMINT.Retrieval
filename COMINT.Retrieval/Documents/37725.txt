tanzania and its public libraries. since tanzania became
    independent in 1961 the library system has been developed as an
    integral part of the education system. in 1963 the library
    services board act was passed which led to the national central
    library in dar es salaam being built in 1967. the library
    started with a stock of 136,000 and is the headquarters of the
    tanzania library services. from this centre other libraries
    were planned, firstly in the district towns, then on a smaller
    scale in rural areas. converted lorries served as mobile
    libraries in rural areas at first. the total stock of public
    libraries still only totals 900,000 for a population of
    17,000,000. a university library was founded in dar es salaam
    in 1961. at present complete training facilities for library
    staff are not available and library students have to spend some
    time studying abroad. a library association exists' tanzania
    library association and publishes a journal called
    2maktaba1.
