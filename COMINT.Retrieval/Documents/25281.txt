space charge waves in cylindrical plasma columns the
    existence of space charge waves in stationary plasmas of finite
    cross section has been demonstrated theoretically and
    experimentally in addition to forward waves a plasma can
    support backward waves when there is a finite axial magnetic
    field this makes possible the design of a back ward wave
    oscillator in which the plasma is the slow wave circuit other
    possible applications are noted
