recent developments in vibrators and vibrator power packs
    discussion of the grade type of vibrator which is expected to
    give at least the hour life required for services equipment
    reasons are given for specializing mainly on synchronous split
    reed separately driven types an outline is given of extensive
    investigations of contact phenomena vibrator design and the
    circuits fed by the vibrator a range of vibrators is described
    with outputs from a few milliwatts to over very high conversion
    efficiencies have been obtained
