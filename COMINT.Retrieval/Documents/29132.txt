introduction. contribution to a thematic issue on library
    training. the present content, level and framework of hungarian
    library training is unsatisfactory' curriculum units are not
    built upon each other; the subjects studied are not separated
    enough on each level and are not adequately coordinated; and
    the combination of subjects does not reflect the demands made
    on libraries. the number of students who go on to work in
    libraries is not known. the authorities have asked for
    suggestions for improving education for librarianship.
