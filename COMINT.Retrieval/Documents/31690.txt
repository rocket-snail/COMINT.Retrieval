modern public records' selection and access. report of a
    committee appointed by the lord chancellor, chairman sir duncan
    wilson; it was presented to the uk parliament by the lord high
    chancellor, mar 81. considers the keeping of public records,
    preservation, and access, provisions of the current public
    records act, and the situation regarding audio-visual and
    machine-readable records. concludes that the system mapped out
    by the earlier grigg report is good in itself and capable of
    adaptation to changing needs and changing technology, but has
    been implemented neither in spirit nor in letter. the
    committee's recommendations focus on this deficiency.
