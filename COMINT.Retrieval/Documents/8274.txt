on the relation between magnetic storm and ionospheric
    disturbances that occurred on sept th patterns of dense e
    blackouts and f layer disturbance in the northern hemisphere
    are compared with the current systems of geomagnetic
    disturbance at different stages of the storm with the
    development of polar cap blackout several hours before the
    sudden commencement of the storm a current system was produced
    in the polar cap region during the main phase blackouts and e
    coincide with strong currents at auroral latitudes
