the influence of a high frequency gas discharge on the
    frequency of a self excited short wave oscillator stage
    continuing earlier investigations further tests were made with
    a oscillator under various conditions of discharge coupling and
    magnetic field characteristic curves indicating a linear
    relation between frequency and anode voltage are obtainable the
    interpretation of the observations is discussed
