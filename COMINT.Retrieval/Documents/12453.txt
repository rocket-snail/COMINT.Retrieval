multistable electronic circuits and decades the design of
    counter circuits is considered from the point of view of
    simplicity and reliability from this point of view it is
    advantageous to keep the number of internal couplings as low as
    possible trigger chains are used with odd numbers of triode
    valves alternately blocked and conducting except for one
    adjacent pair in the same state to ensure stability damping is
    required at the critical frequency circuit arrangements are
    shown for providing this in cases where the two adjacent valves
    in the same condition are both blocked both conducting
