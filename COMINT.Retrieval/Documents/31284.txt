polychloronaphthale impregnated paper capacitors
    polychloronaphthale waxes are particularly suitable for use as
    impregnants in paper dielectric capacitors having stable
    characteristics at temperatures as high as or over in certain
    cases an aging effect is avoided by allowing the wax to cool
    from the liquid to the solid state under the influence of an or
    field this phenomenon is discussed in relation to the dipole
    nature of the waxes
