on the diffraction of electromagnetic pulses by curved
    conducting surfaces starting with the known steady state
    solutions for diffraction by a perfectly conducting convex
    surface the corresponding transient responses are derived using
    fourier laplace inversion explicit results are given for an
    incident wave which varies with time as a step function
