improvement and development of the national centralized
    filing system-an attribute of the information and documentation
    efficiency at the level of the national economy. starting with
    an analysis of the relationship between centralisation and
    decentralisation of information and documentation activities,
    discusses the present state of the art and deficiencies in the
    rumanian network of national centralised files. emphasises the
    economic and scientific advantages which could result from the
    integration of these files into a unique, interconnected
    system. proposes several new types of file which should be
    established within the system and briefly describes the
    operational connections between them.
