on the comparative increases of the f and f ionizations
    from sunspot minimum to sunspot maximum the proportionate
    increase of ionization from the epoch of sunspot minimum to
    sunspot maximum is not the same for the f as for the f layer
    being of the order of for the former and for the latter
    assuming the f region to be due to ionization of atomic oxygen
    an increase in temperature with height above the f maximum an
    effective recombination coefficient decreasing rapidly with
    height calculations are made for three different ionosphere
    models the results being in each case in satisfactory agreement
    with observations
