stability criteria for linear systems and realizability
    criteria for rc networks a new set of stability criteria in
    linear systems is drived about half of the hurwitz criteria can
    be neglected when certain of the coefficients of the
    characteristic equation are positive the conditions for
    realizability of rc networks are closely related to the
    stability and aperiodic criteria and are given in the form of
    polynomial coefficients
