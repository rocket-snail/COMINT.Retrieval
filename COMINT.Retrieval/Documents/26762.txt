noise from hot cathode discharges experiments with
    mercury vapour tubes in which anode glow disturbances were
    eliminated show that low frequency noise in an unsaturated
    discharge is due to a coherent random fluctuation of the whole
    plasma probably caused by fluctuations of the cathode sheath
    under certain conditions another effect was distinguished which
    may e be due to fluctuations of sheaths on the probes used or
    on the tube walls
