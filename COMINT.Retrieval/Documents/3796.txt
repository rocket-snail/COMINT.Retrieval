recombination and attachment in the and layers during the
    solar eclipse of december examination of the variations of
    electron density at heights in the region during the annular
    eclipse of december suggests that there combination process is
    predominant in the region in the region recombination and
    attachment coefficients decrease regularly with height possible
    explanations of the separation of the and layers are
    advanced
