points of view of librarians' alternatives to plr.
    contribution to a thematic issue on public lending right (plr).
    lists the major points of librarian opposition to plr, focusing
    on the questions' do authors have natural proprietary rights
    concerning their texts; are libraries infringing these rights;
    do authors suffer financial damage through library circulation;
    what are the effects of plr on libraries; and who will really
    benefit from plr. librarians do recognise the financial plight
    of most authors and have suggested alternatives to plr in the
    areas of' curtailment of library purchases; special pricing of
    library books; direct tax relief; augmentation of royalty
    income; and augmented programmes of literary awards.
