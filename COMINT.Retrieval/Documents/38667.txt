nonlinear distortion of a random signal application to
    frequency modulation analysis is based on the instantaneous
    statistical properties of a random signal the energy spectrum
    for a given bandwidth being determined from the appropriate
    correlation functions application of the method is illustrated
    in the case of fm when propagation time is considered since the
    calculation takes account of intermodulation products over a
    complete frequency band the method has advantages over that
    based on intermodulation of discrete frequencies
