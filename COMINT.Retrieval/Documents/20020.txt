british videotex experience gives hint of future. uk
    experience with viewdata and teletext, or interactive and
    broadcast videotex, is considered and its disappointing
    progress since it was invented nearly 10 years ago is
    discussed. although the public has been slow to adopt british
    telecom's prestel, some businesses, such as travel agencies and
    real estate firms are finding the interactive system
    attractive. the question of how to define what is news and what
    is advertising is discussed and the exploitation by newspaper
    publishers of the medium's commercial possibilities is
    outlined, with particular reference to the approach of telemap,
    the videotex subsidiary of the east midland allied press.
    finally, the longterm risks to telecom from its limited role as
    a carrier rather than an information provider are
    considered.
