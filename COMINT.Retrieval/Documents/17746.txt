a highly parallel algorithm for approximating all zeros
    of a polynomial with only real zeros an algorithm is described
    based on newton's method which simultaneously approximates all
    zeros of a polynomial with only real zeros. the algorithm,
    which is conceptually suitable for parallel computation,
    determines its own starting values so that convergence to the
    zeros is guaranteed. multiple zeros and their multiplicity are
    readily determined. at no point in the method is polynomial
    deflation used. november, 1972 patrick, m. l. parallel
