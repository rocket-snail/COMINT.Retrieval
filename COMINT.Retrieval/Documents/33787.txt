the excitation of circular polarization in microwave
    cavities a matrix method is used to study the effect of
    transition pieces and differential phase shifters on waves
    propagating in guides with two degenerate orthogonal modes
    three different methods are discussed for generating circularly
    polarized waves in a cavity coupled to the side wall of a guide
    the preferred arrangement uses a square guide with incident
    wave polarized along one transverse diagonal and reflected wave
    polarized z along the other and a circular coupling window
    centred in the width of one wall at an appropriate distance
    from the reflecting end
