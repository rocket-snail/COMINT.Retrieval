electromagnetic properties of plasmas in a magnetic field
    continuation of work reported in of assuming a constant and
    uniform magnetic field results obtained are discussed in
    relation to those of other workers in particular the matrix for
    the complex conductivity of an ionized gas and and the
    dispersion equation previous results apply only for values of
    gyromagnetic frequency small compared with where is the
    electron collision frequency and the pulsatance of the electric
    field
