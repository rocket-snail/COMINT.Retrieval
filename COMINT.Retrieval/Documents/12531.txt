automated additive modeling techniques applied to
    thermochemical property estimation. automated additive modeling
    techniques have been applied to the estimation of heats of
    vaporisation. computer-readable representations of chemical
    structures were analysed algorithmically to derive structural
    groupings to be used in the model. these were then input as
    variables in multiple regression analyses, which gave the group
    contributions to be used in estimation. the method gave good
    estimations for various structural types and could be applied
    to a variety of thermochemical properties.
