an s band variable attenuator for high power working the
    description is given of a waveguide insertion attenuator in
    which the loss in r f power is produced by the action of a
    column of water flowing in a glass tube mounted in the
    waveguide continuous variation of attenuation being obtained by
    adjustment of the water column height resonance effects in the
    water column are exploited by choosing the cross sectional
    dimensions of the glass such that an optimum attenuation per
    unit length of tube is obtained experimental results are given
    for a model covering the range the input being at any setting
    and over the greater part of the range satisfactory operation
    has been achieved in an evacuated test system fed by a
    magnetron delivering peak power at a wavelength of various
    modifications in design are suggested for use with higher mean
    powers
