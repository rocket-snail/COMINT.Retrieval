increase of the gain of a wide band distributed amplifier
    by compensation of its zeros and by arrangement of the residual
    poles in a tchebycheff ellipse a set of equations is obtained
    for a two valve distributed amplifier and its component values
    and characteristics are calculated for a limiting frequency of
    general formulae for distributed amplifiers with any number of
    valves are derived theoretical results are verified with the
    aid of an experimental two valve circuit the tchebycheff type
    of amplifier is shown to have a gain greater by a factor of
    than the conventional distributed amplifier
