absorption and electron distribution in the layer
    determined from measurements of transmitted radio signals from
    earth satellites a comparison is made between measured and
    theoretically derived values of field strength of received
    signals when the satellite is in the region of maximum electron
    concentration and in regions above and below this level field
    strength curves for distances are given
