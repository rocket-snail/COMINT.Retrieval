zzzz. pharmacists are expected to have a thorough
    knowledge of their subject, which can only develop through use
    of a well-equipped, well-staffed library. only a few hungarian
    district and city hospitals meet these demands. the only
    solution would be for a centre of the medical library network
    or the national institute of pharmaceutics to organise
    pharmaceutical information. such an organisation would be able
    to provide information on demand.
