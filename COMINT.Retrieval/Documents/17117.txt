the generation of integrated public transport travel
    information by computer. the existing procedures utilised by
    travel enquiry clerks, when answering inquiries on journeys
    involving interchange, are often cumbersome and sometimes slow.
    the use of a computer to compile travel information would thus
    appear to be of benefit to travellers and public transport
    operators alike by providing the facilities for quicker, more
    accurate and consistent responses to inquirers. the
    practicability of producing computer software that would
    generate schedules of trip-opportunities from the public
    transport timetables was investigated by the transport and road
    research laboratory. (see also 80/2217).
