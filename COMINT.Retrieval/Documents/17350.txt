theory of logical nets two values logic is applied to the
    study of digital computer circuits a logical net is an array
    constructed from a stroke element representing circuit
    components performing logical functions and a delay element
    representing storage components various types of net are
    defined their properties are correlated with those of the
    associated set of equations and a study is made of the
    operations they can perform the classification o digital
    computer circuits in this system is discussed
