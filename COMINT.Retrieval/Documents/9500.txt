a further note on dual integral equations and an
    application to the diffraction of electromagnetic waves a
    solution obtained previously is extended to cover cases in
    which the order of the bessel function kernel is not zero as an
    example the solution is applied to a problem in the diffraction
    of waves by a plane slit discussion of the problem is
    criticized results obtained are in agreement with those of
