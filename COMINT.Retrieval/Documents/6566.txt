rocket measurements of flayer electron density and their
    interpretation theoretical considerations about the shape of
    the electron density profile near the f peak are compared with
    data obtained from rockets of march the results are consistent
    with day and night temperatures of about an respectively
    numerical values of the loss coefficient and other parameters
    are given
