saturable transformer switches a switch using cores in a
    balanced saturable transformer is considered an on off
    impedance ratio adequate for switching magnetic recording heads
    for reading and writing operations can be obtained circuits are
    described for operation of a matrix selection system with a
    switching time of a few tens of microseconds
