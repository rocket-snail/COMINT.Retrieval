electron ion recombination coefficients in nitrogen and
    oxygen microwave determinations of electron density decay
    during the afterglow following ionization of gas in a cavity
    and simultaneous identification of the afterglow positive ion
    current by an rf type mass spectrometer provide information
    from which recombination coefficients can be assigned to
    particular positive ion species
