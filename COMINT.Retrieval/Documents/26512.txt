abnormal ionization in the lower ionosphere associated
    with cosmic ray flux enhancements two separate abnormalities in
    ionization were recognizable during the great solar event of
    february the early effects observed at the time of the sudden
    cosmic ray enhancement and the late effects which reached a
    maximum an appreciable time later a difference in composition
    between streams of solar particles of cosmic ray energies and
    ordinary cosmic rays is postulated to explain the former effect
    while the latter is explained in terms of ionization at heights
    of km produced by the passage or stopping of solar particles
    predominantly protons the absence of auroral and magnetic
    effects is consistent with these explanations a provisional
    evaluation is also made of the coefficient of collisional
    attachment of electrons from negative ions and the negative ion
    electron ratio and effective recombination coefficient at night
