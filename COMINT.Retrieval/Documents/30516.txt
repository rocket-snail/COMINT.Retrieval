the motion of an artificial satellite in the noncentral
    field of terrestrial gravitation in the presence of atmospheric
    resistance the orbit of a fictitious satellite of weight kg and
    diameter has been calculated in four hours using an electronic
    computer the perigee revolves around the earth times in days
    the ascending node regresses in the direction opposite to the
    earths rotation at a rate of about per day
