two years of dealing with swedish publications. describes
    how linkoping university library copes with the deposit copies
    of 200,000 swedish publications per year which it has been
    receiving since it became a deposit library on 1 jan 79. by
    using the list of swedish periodicals some prior cataloguing
    could be done. a plan for distribution of the material
    according to subject to the 7 units which constitute the
    university library was drawn up. after 2 years some publishers
    are still not aware of their duty to deliver, and routines for
    claiming have had to be developed. the monograph copies
    received are intended as regional copies for distribution to
    other institutions within the region, or copies for use within
    the university; a policy of withdrawal was developed, as no
    archival duty exists. problems were caused by the number and
    late delivery of periodicals. handling of leaflets and other
    ephemera has proved most complicated and time consuming, and
    this material remains uncatalogued. the question of its future
    needs urgently to be decided.
