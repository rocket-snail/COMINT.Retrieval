an approach to the potential importance of information in
    engineering. following a previous study concerned with the
    monitoring of information flow, aims to assess the potential
    value of information in the prosecution of engineering
    projects. for each of 3 projects the background of potentially
    useful information was explored and compared with the
    information actually being used. in general no vast amount of
    immediately useful information was found, much of the
    information used deriving from the individual engineer's own
    training and resources. the information flow was regarded as
    adequate for the practical purposes of the projects. however,
    awareness of research information potentially useful for the
    long range planning was limited, the main obstacles to
    information flow of this type being management attitudes and
    organisational constraints.
