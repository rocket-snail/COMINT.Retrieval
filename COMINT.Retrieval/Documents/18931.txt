modeling collection development behaviour' a preliminary
    statement. describes a model for collection development in
    academic libraries within both specific collections and library
    systems as a whole and seeks to demonstrate the full range and
    complexity of relevant factors. although the model presented is
    not now quantifiable in all its dimensions, its analysis is
    seen as leading towards better models for collection
    development, which in turn will allow more useful plans and
    projections.
