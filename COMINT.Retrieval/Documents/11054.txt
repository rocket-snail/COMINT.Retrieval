online literature research at university libraries in the
    federal republic of germany-a progress report. the federal
    government's programme for the promotion of information and
    documentation was passed on 17 dec 74. the aim of the programme
    was to coordinate and improve activities in the information and
    documentation sector which had developed rapidly in recent
    years. the programme concentrated on setting up 4 subject
    oriented data systems' patents, research procedure, environment
    and technological rules. the progress in each area has been
    different. 17 libraries received an on-line connection to the
    dimdi (deutsche insitut fur medizinische dokumentation und
    information) data bank in cologne in the framework of a project
    organised by the ministry for research and technology.
    libraries also had on-line connections to data banks formed by
    the information centre for energy, physics and mathematics. the
    question of finance is the largest obstacle to university
    libraries providing permanent o n-line facilities for
    literature research. although some on-line data services are
    available to libraries free of charge the cost of the hardware
    has to be covered by the libraries.
