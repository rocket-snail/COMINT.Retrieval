future libraries' the electronic environment. argues that
    the library, and its ability to handle information efficiently
    could well be at the centre of change as the new electronic
    technology begins to have a major effect on the information
    environment. concludes that electronic technology holds the
    potential to make the library a more humanistic institution by
    routinising jobs formerly done by professionals, thereby making
    the library more efficient and freeing these professionals to
    interact more closely with the users of information.
