foreign economic literature and its information value.
    foreign economic literature available in bulgarian libraries is
    usually classified as non-marxist publications issued before
    1900. between 1900-45 only a few marxist publications can be
    traced. after world war ii, however, the share of economic
    literature based on marxism increased rapidly. the cyril and
    methodius national library has the largest collection of
    foreign economic literature in the country consisting mainly of
    reference material. the main topic at the university of sofia
    library is economic history and some unique publications can be
    found there, for example from the early days of the soviet
    union. economic theory is represented above all at the library
    of the bulgarian academy of sciences. economic colleges in
    varna and sviscov cater for the needs of their students. there
    are also some specialised collections and catalogues at the
    bulgarian chamber of commerce and the central agricultural
    library, established some time ag o. the majority of foreign
    economic literature is in russian, english, german and french.
    advocates the increased exploitation of all the national
    resources listed above.
