the point of sale...for library and chain store
    partnership. tesco stores ltd, with the cooperation of the
    libraries & arts and social services department of
    gateshead council (england), have financed the installation of
    a prestel set at sunderland road library to provide shopping
    and community information. tesco is operating an ordering and
    delivery service, whilst prestel provides both consumer and
    community information, including details of availability of
    goods, recipes and price comparisons. the library supplements
    prestel with a range of leaflets and information on consumer
    advice, welfare rights and benefits. whilst it is too early to
    assess the scheme's impact, people who never previously used
    the library are now coming through the doors, and for the
    disabled the library is contributing to an improvement in the
    standard and quality of life.
