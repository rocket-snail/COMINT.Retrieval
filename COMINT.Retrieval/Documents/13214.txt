literature and reading in the german democratic republic.
    statistics for the last 10 years in east germany reflect the
    success achieved by the publishing industry in stimulating
    public interest in reading and in trying to satisfy readers'
    needs. the importance of providing the widest possible range of
    material on different subjects and in different languages is
    recognised. foreign material most in demand is that from the
    ussr, followed by works from other communist countries and from
    the third world. naturally a wide range of contemporary
    domestic literature is also available. in 1980, library stocks
    totalled 80 million items and the booktrade turnover has
    increased by 32% during the last 5 years. close links have been
    developed between authors, publishers and the public. more
    research into reading habits and communication through
    literature is required.
