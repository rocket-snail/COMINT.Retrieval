the concept of heterogeneous surface impedance and its
    application to cylindrical cavity resonators formulae are
    developed relating the q factor and the resonant frequency of a
    cavity to its dimensions and the fourier components of the
    surface impedance function the cases of circumferential and
    axial heterogeneity are analysed in detail in general a unique
    value of surface impedance cannot apply to an unbounded
    periodic sheet unless the period is small compared with
