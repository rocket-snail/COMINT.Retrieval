microforms use in guardian royal exchange assurance.
    paper presented and the micrographics in banking and insurance
    seminar, bristol, mar 80. presents an outline of the structure
    and organisation of the guardian royal exchange assurance
    company, a composite insurance company dealing in all classes
    of insurance. for legal reasons paper records are important,
    since, although microfilm is accepted by courts, the evidence
    on it may not be accepted. use of microfilm to save space in
    keeping records has to be simple and cost-effective. a pilot
    scheme was launched at 5 branches, using 16 of the largest and
    most suitable tabulations for microfilm. a report on problems
    in the use of microfilm was produced, highlighting resistance
    to change, and criticisms of the microreader. a modified front
    projection reader was obtained and was received with much
    acclaim. the conversion of computer tabulated output to com is
    reaching its conclusion, and the company is now looking at
    conventional microfilming of p aper records.
