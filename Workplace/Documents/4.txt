training library assistants in mauritius. the university
    of mauritius with the financial help of the international
    development research centre of canada (idrc) embarked on a 15
    month experimental course in 1978 for the training of library
    assistants who were already working in libraries. the main aim
    of the experiment was to evolve a course of approximately 1
    year taking 3 afternoons weekly, geared to local conditions and
    using available resources. the experiment was a success and the
    course, after minor alterations, was continued in 1981.
